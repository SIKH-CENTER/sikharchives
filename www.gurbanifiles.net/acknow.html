<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Date of this posting: 
December 11, 2005. </font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">The distribution of 
Gurbani-CD started on November 14, 1995.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Although the making 
and duplication of Gurbani-CD is controlled by Kulbir Singh Thind, MD; its 
creation has been possible due to a selfless dedication of a number of 
individuals.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">It is worth mentioning 
here that many individuals and organizations have been making their own efforts 
to do similar projects and some have produced valuable results.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">One such project 
was</font><b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><font face="Arial">started many years ago by S. Jaswant Singh-ji, an engineer by 
profession. He typed the text from Siri Guru Granth Sahib into the computer and 
is thus the main architect of this project. </font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">S. Jaswant Singh-ji 
did most of the work of typing, initial proof reading and editing of the text of 
Siri Guru Granth Sahib. S. Jagjit Singh Karwel helped in typing the text of many 
hundreds of pages.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">The most difficult 
part of this project has been to eliminate all mistakes of text entry. That 
required extensive proof reading, a task that may seem simple but is very 
difficult and time consuming. Many dedicated individuals were helpful in this 
regard. The names of those individuals are mentioned below.</font></span></p>
<p class="15" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 22.5pt; TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Kulwant Singh-ji, who in 
addition to being an ophthalmologist (a retired medical doctor) is also a Sikh 
studies scholar and a writer of many books on Sikhism. His “Maansrovar” and some 
other documents are included on Gurbani-CD. He did a commendable job of ‘full 
proof-reading’ of the whole of Siri Guru Granth Sahib, twice. He also helped in 
this project in many other ways as described later. </font></span></p>
<p class="15" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 22.5pt; TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the correction work 
done before, a very extensive correction work was done by Parminder Singh Aujla 
of Hopewell Junction, New York, USA; before the 2</font><sup><font face="Arial">nd</font></sup><font face="Arial"> proof reading by 
Dr. Kulwant Singh.</font></span></p>
<p class="15" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 22.5pt; TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many other individuals helped in 
proof-reading the typed text from Siri Guru Granth Sahib and many of them edited 
it a number of times. Their names are: S. Jagdev Singh Beasley, Bibi Avtar Kaur 
Beasley, Giani Amarjit Singh-ji, S. Rajinder Singh Dhaliwal, Bibi Surinder Kaur 
Dhaliwal, S. Manjit Singh Sahota (with the help of his niece) and Bibi Khushdev 
Kaur Thind. </font></span></p>
<p class="15" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 22.5pt; TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The already proof-read files have 
been further improved recently with cooperation from SGPC. </font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">The text of Bhai 
Gurdaas's Bannies has been typed by S. Maninderpal Singh and his other family 
members in Delhi, India. </font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">The text of Bhai 
Gurdaas’ Vaars have also been independently typed according to SGPC publication 
and proof read by Bhai Baljinder Singh of Rara Sahib Wale.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">To achieve proper 
appearance of the text from Siri Guru Granth Sahib on pages, many logical 
formatting decisions had to be made. Dr. Kulbir Singh Thind, MD; was responsible 
in this regard by utilizing his word processing &amp; other computer related 
technical skills. He was also responsible for all conversions of the text of 
Gurbani related files to Devanagari (Hindi script) and its phonetic 
transliteration (romanization). He has also converted Sri Guru Granth Sahib text 
to Unicode Gurmukhi and Devanagari fonts that are based on the industry accepted 
international standard. It is thankfully acknowledged that S. Piara Singh Bagri 
&amp; Satwinderjit Singh Bagri from Tracy, California, USA; made valuable 
recommendations for improving conversion of SGGS text to Devanagari.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">All the fonts on the 
Gurbani-CD have been made by Dr. Kulbir Singh Thind, and are his copyright. He 
has been making and distributing Gurmukhi fonts (free of charge) for many years. 
His Gurmukhi type-faces, named “Amrit-Lipi” had a wide distribution. However, 
Amrit-Lipi lacked some subscript characters (shown below) that were required to 
correctly type text from Siri Guru Granth Sahib. Dr. Kulwant Singh-ji, did a 
thorough search of Siri Guru Granth Sahib to list all such characters for Dr. 
Thind, who then developed a new font for the purpose of writing Siri Guru Granth 
Sahib and named it “Gurbani-Lipi”. This font was gradually perfected over time 
and other similar fonts were also developed.                 </font></span></p>

not found in the Amrit-Lipi were included in the “GurbaniLipi” and in all the 
fonts that were developed subsequently.</font></span>
<p class="15" style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Conversion of the text 
of Siri Guru Granth Sahib from Gurmukhi to Hindi (during the earlier years) 
required a customized Hindi font which was then developed. Some characters found 
in Gurmukhi do not have equivalent characters in Hindi. Decision was made to 
import those characters in the custom Hindi font.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">On release of Windows 
XP operating system, it became possible to use Unicode Gurmukhi and Devanagari 
fonts based on the international standard. By this time other operating systems 
have also made it possible to use Unicode Gurmukhi &amp; Devanagari fonts. Dr. 
Thind has thus developed Unicode Gurmukhi fonts.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Phonetic 
transliteration (romanization) of Siri Guru Granth Sahib text in common English 
characters has also been completed by Kulbir Singh Thind, MD. Prior to this 
Conversion of Siri Guru Granth Sahib text to Roman was done with a different 
approach, i.e., by making a specialized font. All the search and decision making 
regarding the development of this font has been done by Kulbir Singh Thind who 
then created the font and named it “GurbaniRomanizing”. Dr. Kulwant Singh-ji 
made many suggestions for this font, a few of which were 
incorporated.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Kulbir S. Thind has 
also been responsible for making of &quot;Sentence by Sentence SGGS text with Page 
Line Raag Author labels&quot; document. The text in this document is arranged in an 
easy to use format for scholarly work. In this document each sentence from Siri 
Guru Granth Sahib is arranged as a single line or in a few instances in double 
line paragraphs. Each line/paragraph ends with the page number, line number, 
Raag and Author for easy reference. This file has been further developed by 
including Dr. Khalsa’s (see below) English translation underneath each line of 
Gurmukhi text. Another file also includes sentence by sentence phonetic 
transliteration done by Kulbir Singh Thind, MD.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Singh Sahib Sant Singh 
Khalsa, MD, graciously gave his permission to record his English translation of 
Siri Guru Granth Sahib on the Gurbani-CD. Users will find his work very 
valuable. We are very thankful to Dr. Khalsa for his generosity.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">An additional document 
named “Translation Comparison” included on the Gurbani-CD is also compiled by 
Dr. Khalsa and compares the five available English translations of Siri Guru 
Granth Sahib.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">&quot;Sri Guru Granth 
Darpan,&quot; Gurmukhi text to Punjabi (Gurmukhi) translation of all of Sri Guru 
Granth Sahib by Professor Sahib Singh is included since version 2002 of the 
Gurbani-CD. The work of getting it typed into computer has been spearheaded by 
S. Avtar Singh &amp; Davinder Kaur Dhami, 3336 Bridge Road Hayward, CA 94545, 
USA; who got the text typed in Amritsar, India and also paid for this task. This 
is all done with permission from Dr. Daljit Singh, M.B.B.S, M.S., Amritsar, 
India. On the internet &quot;Sri Guru Granth Darpan&quot; is available at 
http://www.gurugranthdarpan.com. Thanks to Dhami family &amp; Dr. Daljit Singh. 
Dr. Thind formatted the typed text of “Sri Guru Granth Darpan” for use on the 
computer and on the internet.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">S. Kirpal Singh Pannu 
of Ontario, Canada; who has been providing many coputer related linguistic 
services to Punjabi writers for many years has been helpful in converting Sri 
Guru Granth Sahib text into Shahmukhi (Urdu) and those files are made available 
on the Gurbani-CD. Many thanks to him.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">S. Manjit Singh Sahota 
of San Jose, California, a computer professional, has been kind enough to 
contribute to the Gurbani-CD by creating (1) &quot;All Words List&quot; from Siri Guru 
Granth Sahib files (2) a “Word Index” file that indexes all words from SGGS 
(Siri Guru Granth Sahib) with page and line numbers (3) a “sorting” program to 
help users sort lines of text written with GurbaniLipi according to the Gurmukhi 
alphabet and (4) by sorting the “Alphabetized Sentence by Sentence SGGS Text” 
file according to the Gurmukhi alphabet. The sorting program created by S. 
Manjit Singh Sahota works under Windows 95/98 DOS and can sort up to 2000 lines 
of text. S. Manjit Singh Sahota has also been helpful in many other ways. He 
deserves numerous thanks. </font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Mr. Jasjeet Singh 
Thind, a computer software engineer, was very helpful (at that time he was a 
student at Cornell University) in remaking of “All Words from Siri Guru Granth 
Sahib” files and “Index of All Words in Siri Guru Granth Sahib” files. He did a 
perfect job. This work needed to be done again for following reasons: Since the 
making of the original “All Words List” and “Word Index”, the Siri Guru Granth 
Sahib files had been perfected for spellings and it was time to make new “All 
Words” list and “Index” files that reflect necessary changes (also some 
omissions regarding page &amp; line references were discovered in the previous 
Index). Regarding Sikh scriptures, Jasjeet Singh Thind has also contributed in 
another big way, by making a web search engine available at 
http://www.srigranth.org.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">The documents in the 
“PSSG Trust” folder on the Gurbani-CD are included by the courtesy of Professor 
Sahib Singh Gurmat Trust and have been spearheaded with the labor of love by Dr. 
Gurcharan Singh, Ph.D., Academy of Sikh Religion &amp; Culture, 1 Dhillon Marag, 
Patiala 147001, India. The names of other individuals associated with these 
documents are described in the leading pages of the documents. Dr. Gurcharan 
Singh’s publications &quot;SGGS Kosh&quot;, &quot;Tuk Tatkara&quot;, “Haumai”&amp; “Nadir” are 
included on the Gurbani-CD.&nbsp; Dr. Gurcharan Singh is a distinguished scholar of 
Sikhism who has devoted many years of hard labor in producing many Sikhism 
related reference materials. His latest addition is a marvelous dictionary 
(Gurmukhi to Gurmukhi Kosh) of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. This is not just a repeat 
of what has been done before but an honest update of all similar work ever 
produced before. In this document, a citation for each meaning is provided with 
text from Sri Guru Granth Sahib. My heartfelt thanks to him for choosing 
Gurbani-CD a medium for making some of his reference materials available to 
Gurbani-CD users without any financial gain.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Bhai Baljinder 
Singh 
of Rara Sahib 
Wale, 
(16914 Lassen Street, 
Northridge, CA 91343, USA) </font></span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:10pt;"><strong><font face="Arial">who</font></strong></span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial"> preaches the 
teachings of Sikhism all over the world, as expounded by Sant Isher Singh ji; 
has been working for a number of years to make the important Sikhism literature 
resources available for use on the computer. He has thus been responsible for 
getting important Gurbani texts typed into the computer, the ones that were not 
already done. He has been instrumental in creating Gurbani Search Software named 
Isher Micromedia Software. This search tool can search text of Sri Guru Granth 
Sahib and Vaars/Kabits Bhai Gurdas ji in a hurry. Besides this, he has provided 
the basic and detailed source material about Gurbani, Sikhism &amp; Sikh 
History. This is being offered free of cost as a humble service to the Sikh 
Community worldwide. Bhai Baljinder Singh started the project of getting 
Mahankosh by Bhai Kahan Singh ‘Nabha’ typed into the computer in 1996 and it got 
completed in 1998. Mahankosh was then made available for downloading at </font></span><span style="font-family:Times; font-size:10pt;"><a href="http://www.rarasahib.com/"><font face="Arial">http://www.rarasahib.com</font></a></span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial"> and then at </font></span><span style="font-family:Times; font-size:10pt;"><a href="http://www.ik13.com/"><font face="Arial">http://www.ik13.com</font></a></span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial"> . A pdf file of 
MahanKosh is also included on the Gurbani-CD. Many other files relating to Sikh 
literature that are prepared by Bhai Baljinder Singh-ji are also included on the 
Gurbani-CD inside the folder “9 Files by Bhai Baljinder Singh”.&nbsp; He rightfully 
deserves thanks from the users of his files and search-engine 
software.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">All the scanned images 
inside the “Photos by Nirmal Dhesi” folder have become available on the 
Gurbani-CD courtesy of Nirmal Singh Dhesi, Professor Emeritus, Department of 
English, State University, Sonoma, California. Professor Dhesi made many 
photographic slides of historic Gurdwaras and of associated art work in 1980s. 
His photographic work is very professional. Upon request from Dr. Thind, 
Professor Dhesi made those slides available for scanning for inclusion of his 
valuable work on the Gurbani-CD with a condition that the scanned images be not 
used by anyone for any publication or commercial exploitation. Dr. Thind is 
happy to scan those slides and make those available for viewing purposes. 
Professor Dhesi deserves many thanks for this generous contribution.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Many a photographs in 
the &quot;Gurdwara Photos&quot; folder are provided by Rajinder Singh Dhaliwal from 
Fishkil, New York. Thanks to him.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Permission has also 
been obtained from “Sikh Missionary Center, PO BOX 62521, Phoenix, Arizona 
85082” to include on the Gurbani-CD an approximately 263 page document on “Sikh 
Religion” written in English. The Sikh Missionary Center (responsible 
individual: S. Jaswant Singh) deserves sincere thanks.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">We are thankful to Dr. 
Harbans Lal Ph.D., who has retired as Chairman of Department of Pharmacology, 
University of North Texas, and the founder of ‘Academy of Guru Granth Studies’ 
for providing moral support and for his participation in some decision making 
processes, in the initial stages of the making of Gurbani-CD.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">The documents in the 
“Gahir, Avtar” folder on the Gurbani-CD have been formatted with the labor of 
love by: Avtar Singh Gahir, President, Kingston Sikh Cultural Society, Ontario, 
CANADA. Thanks to him for his contribution.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">The document “Ardaas” 
inside the folder “Randhawa, Joginder” on the Gurbani-CD has been written by: 
Dr. Jogindar Singh Randhawa, MBBS, England, UK. Thanks to him for his 
contribution.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">No funds were ever 
collected for the completion of this project. All individuals who helped in the 
project did it with the understanding that this was a free “Sewa” (voluntary 
service) and that the project was a non-commercial one for “Sewa” (community 
service) only.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Many other individuals 
including a number of friends and relatives of Sewadars (volunteers) have 
offered their support and help for the completion of the project and deserve 
thanks.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">When the distribution 
of the Gurbani-CDs was started in Nov. 95, we expected to distribute only a few 
hundred of these. However, the experience proved otherwise. By the end of 
February 96, we had already recorded (at home) and distributed more than 550 of 
Gurbani-CDs and the demand seemed to be increasing. By then it became obvious 
that the distribution of Gurbani-CDs by recording at home was not an efficient 
method for the given demand. Subsequently, many thousands of professionally made 
Gurbani-CDs have been distributed and over the years a number of different 
versions of Gurbani-CDs have been released.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Dr. Tarlochan Singh of 
the Sikh Center of Orange County (a Gurdwara in Southern California) was very 
enthused about the Gurbani-CD. The Sikh Center has contributed significantly 
towards the manufacture of compressed CDs and offered its services for the 
distribution of the Gurbani-CDs. It may be noted that subsequently the name of 
the organization involved in the distribution of Gurbani-CDs has changed to 
&quot;Shri Guru Granth Sahib Foundation, Inc.&quot; Thanks to Dr. Tarlochan Singh and 
other involved in this service, especially Bickey Singh. However, currently Dr. 
Tarlochan Singh and Bickey Singh are not active in the distribution of 
Gurbani-CDs.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Dr. Thind is 
personally indebted to the following individuals who provided their support 
during early days of the making of the Gurbani-CDs by supplying significant 
number of recordable CDs and helping in the distribution: Dr. Gurpal Singh 
Bhuller, MD, Virginia; Dr. Pritam Singh, Ph.D., Texas; S. Surinder Singh, 
California; Dr. Baljit S. Sidhu, MD, Virginia; S. Shamsher Singh Puri, 
Georgia.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">We are also indebted 
to S. Charanjit Singh Anand of Massachusettes &amp; S. Kirat Singh Sethi of New 
York who provided valuable support and contact with S. Maninder Singh Sethi of 
New York that led to the initial manufacture of stamped Gurbani-CDs.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Dr. Harbhajan Singh 
Chawla, MD; of New Jersey provided many recordable CDs as well as $2500 for the 
manufacture of professionally compressed Gurbani-CDs. </font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Dr. Thind is also 
thankful to Dr. Jasbir Singh Mann, MD; Dr. Bhupinder Singh Waraich, MD; Dr. 
Prabhjot Singh Khalsa, MD; and late Dr. Sunder Singh Saluja, Ph.D. for their 
support in the project.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Dr. Jasbir Singh Mann, 
MD from Orange County, California, USA, is very active in the Sikh community and 
is involved in many activities in the promotion of Sikhism. He has also been 
very helpful in the making and distribution of Gurbani-CDs.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">Our thanks are due to 
numerous other individuals (not listed here) who provided monetary or other help 
in the manufacture and distribution of the Gurbani-CDs. Many of them have 
provided support directly to the Sikh Center. We are very grateful for their 
kindness.</font></span></p>
<p class="15"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:navy;"><font face="Arial">All users of the 
Gurbani-CD deserve our special thanks. It is mainly their enthusiasm and love 
for learning from Gurbani that has made this project such a huge 
success.</font></span></p><p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
