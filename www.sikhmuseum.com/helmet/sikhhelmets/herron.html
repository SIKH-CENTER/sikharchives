  <h2>Importance of Herron Feather Plumes in Sikh Headgear</h2>
      
<p>Among traditional Indo-Persian style helmets used in Islamic  and some Indian armies, one of the distinct helmet elements is a central spike  at the apex of the helmet. Traditionally this spike is pyramidal, or spear  shaped. Among the helmets of the Sikh Empire, the overwhelming design element seen at  the helmet apex is not a spike, but a porte-aigrette plume holder designed to  hold high a kalgi plume on the wearers head.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Herron Plumes &quot;Kalghi&quot; - the helmets of the Sikhs are  ornamented with one or three plumes of black heron's feathers which are prized,  one feather only being found in each wing. Their stems are bound with gold and  silver wire. (Egerton, 1880) [1]</em></p>
<p>The tri-porte-aigrette configuration with a kalgi plume at  the apex of a helmet and two other kalgi plumes is also found on helmets from  other regions of South Asia, but it seems to have been an important  and significant element in the design of helmets from Punjab.</p>

<p class="indent1"><em>The steel helmet is of a hemispherical shape with gold lines separating  ribs which radiate from the damascened heron plume holder crowning the top. The  forehead band is decorated with gold kuft work, and in front are two heron  plumes with an ornamental bar between them, which can be lowered to protect the  nose. (Cole, 1874) [2]</em></p>
<p>The kalgi plume was typically made from slender black heron  feathers mounted on sticks, with gold gimp in circular sprays, and called  batkha-kalgi. [3]</p>
<p>The high regard that Sikhs had for the kalgi plume may date  back to the time of Guru Hargobind (1595 – 1644), the 6th Guru of the Sikhs. As  a symbol of temporal authority as a Guru and as a King he wore the ornaments of  royalty which may have included a plume and the Guru was referred to by Sikhs  as &lsquo;Sacha Padshah&rsquo; (The True King). Guru Gobind Singh (1666-1708) the 10th and  final living Guru of the Sikhs is also often referred to by Sikhs as  &lsquo;Kalgiaa(n)vala&rsquo;, meaning the one who wears the plume.</p>
<p>The importance placed on the kalgi plume seems to have  become an integral part of the headgear of high ranking members of the Sikh Royal  Court at Lahore as well as senior officers in the army of Maharaja Ranjit  Singh.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Plumes have been made of herons' feathers in many countries, and here  they are in great request, as no Sikh officer of any rank is ever seen without  one in his turban ; and in those of the Surdars, or great men, the feathers,  generally an uneven number, between ten and twenty, are fastened into a funnel-shaped  stem, entirely covered with gold wire or thread, or sometimes richly ornamented  with pearls, emeralds, and rubies. (Vigne, 1842) [4]</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Their fondness for showy and gaudy colours is excessive, especially  amongst the higher class; and usually consists of a yellow, orange, crimson, or  other bright-coloured robe, with a turban to correspond: most of these articles  being composed of silk stuffs. The majority carried a spear or sword, and  shield; and a few wore a curious sort of plume, about a foot high, and top of  which, from its arrangement, very much resembles the flower of the cockscomb,  but the remaining parts being bare, gives it too much of the ragged appearance  to look well. (Barr, 1844) [5]</em></p>
