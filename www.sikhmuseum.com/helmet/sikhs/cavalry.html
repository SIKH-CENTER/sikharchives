  <h2>Cavalry of the Sikh Kingdom</h2>
      
<p>Evidence indicates that the use of helmets by Sikhs in the  army of the Sikh Kingdom of Maharaja Ranjit Singh seems to have been primarily confined to the cavalry.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Sikh Kingdom, the cavalry seems  to have worn turbans and we do not find any accounts of troops of the Empire wearing  a helmet until the 1831 meeting at Ropar between Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the  British Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck in 1831. </p>
<p>Earlier images of Sikh cavalry as well as earlier accounts  mention the wearing of turbans rather than helmets. Doctor Murray a British  physician wrote the following in a letter dated January 1, 1827 to Captain  Wade, the British resident at Ludhiana:</p>

<div class="picture_right1"><a href="images\art_Sikhs6.jpg" title="Typical horsemen of the cavalry of the Sikh Empire with large flowing turban over a smaller inner turban rather than a helmet. ca. 1830, Private Collection" class="fancybox"><img src="thumbs\thumb_Sikhs10.jpg" width="300" height="232" border="0"></a><br>
  <div class="piccaption1">Two Sikh cavalry soldiers, ca. 1830</div>
</div>

<p class="indent1"><em>&lsquo;…while the Raja was at breakfast, two regiments of Cavalry (about 1000  men in all) had arrived and taken up ground about two hundred yards in front.  They were drawn up in line and after performing a few evolutions which were done  very slowly, they marched round in review by threes. The men were dressed in  red jackets and Pantaloons. They had also red lined pagries.&rsquo; [1]</em></p>
<p>The gradual use of helmets among the cavalry may have been  part of the major reorganization of the cavalry under Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s  European officers which first started in 1822 with the appointments of French  Generals Allard and Ventura.</p>
<p>The cavalry of the Lahore Empire was composed of three main  groups:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The  regular cavalry</strong> – Highly disciplined troops, initially under the command of  French Generals Allard and Ventura and composed of regiments modelled along  European lines. Primarily composed of lancer and dragoon regiments.</li>
  <li><strong>Ghorchurra  Fauj</strong> – These were irregular cavalry troops made up of soldiers from distinguished  and important families in the Empire and were directly paid by the state. They  were sometimes also referred to as &lsquo;Bodyguards&rsquo; of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.</li>
  <li><strong>Jagirdari  Fauj</strong> – These were irregular troops under the pay and command of feudal  landlords who were expected to maintain a standing army ready for use by the  Lahore Empire when needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>An early account from 1838 provides a general  overview of the Sikh cavalry at that time as well as makes observations  regarding the type of head-dress commonly worn among the various branches:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The Cavalry is  Runjeet's favourite arm, and he has spared no pains to render it efficient. The  total strength is estimated at 40,000, or thereabouts of which 4,000 only are  regulars. They comprise two regiments of Lancers and six of Dragoons;  disciplined according to the French system by Monsieur Allard, a distinguished  officer of the Imperial Army. The regular Cavalry are well mounted and  equipped, and in large bodies work well together. The Dragoons are fine men,  armed with long carbines, pistols and swords. Their appointments are of black  leather, with jack boots. Clothing scarlet, with green facings, and close  fitting steel helmets, of the Roman pattern. The Lancers are dressed in blue,  with scarlet facings, and a profusion of lace; have high cloth caps, and are  armed with lances twelve feet in length, surmounted with the tri-coloured flag.  The Ghorechurras or body-guard, 2,000 in number are the best mounted of the  Sikh Cavalry. To them Ghorechurras or body-guard, 2,000 in number are the best  mounted of the Sikh Cavalry. To them is entrusted the safety of the Rajah's  person. They are excellent swordsmen, and equally expert with the matchlock and  lance. Their dress is superb, being an under tunic of padded crimson silk, over  which is worn ornamental chain armour of the most beautiful workmanship,  covering almost every vulnerable part. The head-dress, a conical turban of  bright yellow silk, surmounted by a brazen head piece, from which the chain  armour descends, and is crowned by long waving heron plumes. [2]</em></p>
<p class="subtitle1">Irregular Cavalry</p>
<p>The cavalry of the Sikh Empire in general lacked  standardization in terms of their equipment and uniform. The irregular cavalry  composed of the Ghorchurra Fauj and the Jagirdari Fauj presented the highest  degrees of variation in uniform including the diverse use or turbans or helmets. This  lack of standardization can primarily be attributed to two factors. Firstly  they were required to purchase their own uniforms and weapons. Secondly a  rivalry existed as each strived to outshine each other in terms of their  uniform and equipment.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The irregular troops  consist chiefly of cavalry, who are obliged to furnish their own horses,  weapons, and clothing; some are armed with spears, shields, and bows, and the  greater part of them have matchlock guns; they are excellent soldiers, brave  and vigilant, and are quickly rallied after a defeat. (Orlich, 1845) [3]</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The irregulars, in their dress and appointments, fully justify the  appellation which their habits and mode of making war obtained for them.  Cotton, silk, or broad cloth tunics of various colours, with the addition of  shawls, cloaks, breast-plates, or coats of mail, with turbans or helmets, ad  libitium, impart to them a motley but picturesque appearance. (Steinbach, 1845)  [4]</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The irregular levies and jagirdari contingents of horse, not included  in the above, cannot be accurately determined, but they may be fairly estimated  at 30,000 men. These were the picturesque element in the Maharaja's reviews.  Many of the men were well-to-do country gentlemen, the sons, relations, or  clansmen of the chiefs who placed them in the field and maintained them there,  and whose personal credit was concerned in their splended appearance. There was  no uniformity in their dress. Some wore a shirt of mail, with a helmet inlaid  with gold and a kalgi or heron's plume; others were gay with the many coloured  splendours of velvet and silk, with pink or yellow muslin turbans, and gold  embroidered belts carrying their sword and powder horn. All wore at the back,  the small round shield of tough buffalo hide. These magnificent horsemen were  armed some with bows and arrows, but the majority with matchlocks, and which  they made excellent practice. (Griffin, 1892) [5]</em></p>
<p class="subtitle1">Regular Cavalry</p>
<p>Even among the troops of the regular cavalry, we also find inconsistencies  in uniform, weapons and armour including the mixed use of turbans and helmets. </p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Almost every one of the Sikh officers of these regular troops was  dressed according to his own taste; some in English, others in French uniform,  or in a mixture of both; some wore turbans, or caps with shawls wrapped round  them, and others helmets and chakos: some had high boots with coloured tops,  other shoes; some wore white, and others coloured pantaloons. (Orlich, 1845)  [6]</em></p>

<p>In a set of four paintings done be a native painter of Sikh  horsemen, three of the horsemen are depicted wearing Indo-Persian style  helmets. Although identified by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum as dating from  1840 to 1845, given their drawing style they may be older and possibly from the  1820&rsquo;s to the 1830&rsquo;s. These are very important because two of the three  horsemen in the paintings wearing helmets are lancers. Although there are many  eyewitness accounts of dragoons of the regular cavalry wearing helmets, these  two painting represent conclusive evidence that lancers also wore helmets as  well.</p>
<p>An important drawing that appeared in the memoirs of Doctor  John Martin Honigberger (Thirty-Five Years in the East, publ. 1852) depicts a  cavalry officer wearing a helmet. The image in the book is captioned as  &lsquo;Charaina Sowar (a Cuirassier), Plate V&rsquo; and depicts a Sikh soldier on  horseback wearing an Indo-Persian style helmet and body plate armour. Although  the armour has been incorrectly identified as being of the char-aina variety  which is composed of four segmented plates, the horseman is in fact wearing a  one-piece French cuirass body armour. Cuirassiers typically wore the cuirass body  armour with a helmet. These cuirass&rsquo;s were a gift of the French King Louis  Philippe and 500 of them were brought to Punjab by Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s  French General Allard. </p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Letter dated Dec 3, 1836 from Lord Auckland (Governor-General of India)  to Sir Charles Metcalfe: &lsquo;You will have seen in the papers the arrival of  General Allard in a French frigate. He brings a present of 500 cuirasses and  2000 stands of arms from the French king to Ranjit Singh, and is accredited  French Charge d&rsquo; Affaires at Lahore&rsquo; [7] </em></p>
<p>The use of a helmet with the cuirass body armour in the  regular cavalry under General Allard&rsquo;s command was observed by William Barr who  visited the Lahore Kingdom in 1839:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>On their right were two regiments of Allard's cuirassiers, the most  noble-looking troops on parade. The men and horses were all picked, and amongst  the former are to be seen many stalwart fellows, who appear to advantage under  their cuirasses and steel casques (helmets). Particular attention seems to have  been paid in setting the men well up, and their accoutrements are kept in the  highest order. Many of the officers wear brass cuirasses, and their commandant  is perhaps the finest man of the whole body, and looked extremely well in front  of his superb regiment (Barr, 1844) [8]</em></p>
<p>Barr also provides a detailed written description of a  Cuirassier wearing a helmet which is almost identical to the drawing of a  helmeted Cuirassier in Dr. Honigberger&rsquo;s memoirs:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The uniform consisted of a short blue coat and a pair of dark trousers  with a narrow red stripe tightly strapped over Wellington boots and spurs. The  cuirass was of highly polished steel, or brass, and bore a Gallic cock in the  centre of the breast plate. The head-dress was a round steel cap from the apex  of which sprung a red horse hair plume. From the cap depended a curtain of  chain mail, which hung down over the neck and shoulders. The arms consisted of  a flint-lock carbine, and a long steel sword depending from the waist-belt by  steel chains. A leather waist-belt, and a pouch belt completed the very  effective outfit. [9]</em></p>
<p>Details of General Allard&rsquo;s Dragoons cavalry regiment and  their use of helmets can be found in the Turban Helmet section.</p>
