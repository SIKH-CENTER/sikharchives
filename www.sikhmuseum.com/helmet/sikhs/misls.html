  <h2>Sikh Misls</h2>
      
<p>During the post-Guru period of the 18th century  as groups of Sikh warriors under the command of a number of regional chieftains  (Misls) engaged in a war for survival and eventual Sikh sovereignty in Punjab  against hostile Mughal and Afghan forces, we find the very first references to Sikhs  wearing helmets.</p>
<p>One of the three oldest chronicles of early Sikh history  during the post-Guru era is the composition <em>Sri  Gur Panth Prakash</em> written by Rattan Singh Bhangoo started in 1808 and  completed in 1841. Rattan Singh was well acquainted with Sikh history being the  grandson of famous Sikh warrior, Mehtab Singh, who had killed Massa Ranghar and  his chronicle based on family history and Sikh oral tradition provides  important insights into the Sikh struggle for survival during the Misl era.</p>
<p>Chronicling the Sikh battles with the enemy forces of Afghan  Ahmed Shah Durrani who invaded Punjab a number of times between 1848 and 1869,  Rattan Singh mentions that the Afghans who were havily armoured wore helmets:</p>

    <div class="piccaption1">Afghan  soldiers of the Durrani Empire</div>     
</div>

<p class="indent1"><em>As his troops left  Lahore (on their way to Delhi),<br>
  They consisted of the most muscular giants of men,<br>
  They boasted, &ldquo;where are those so-called brave Singhs,<br>
  We would like to have a glimpse of them.&rdquo; (2)</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Huge horses had they,  being themselves very tall,<br>
  They were being led by the highest Pathan chiefs.<br>
  With steel helmets on their heads, bodies wrapped in steel armour,<br>
  They had steel coverings even around their legs. (3)</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>With feet in steel  shoes and hands in steel gloves,<br>
  They had steel covers even on their horses.<br>
  These Gilja sect Pathan soldiers launched an expedition,<br>
  With the assistance of Pathan soldiers of Kasur. (4) [1]</em></p>
<p>An early reference to a Sikh wearing a helmet appears as  Rattan Singh chronicles how a Sikh warrior named Sukha Singh donned armour,  including a helmet as he prepared for battle with a Pathan:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Remarked Sukha Singh,  &ldquo;Blessed are you, my dear boy,<br>
  Now see how I deal with that audacious Pathan?&rdquo;<br>
  With these words Sukha Singh sent for his steel armour,<br>
  And covered his head and hands with steel helmet and gloves. (30)</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>He saddled his horse  covering it with a steel armour,<br>
  Which he had once snatched from a Pathan soldier.<br>
  Charat Singh helped him in wearing that armour,<br>
  As well as decorated Sukha Singh&rsquo;s horse for an encounter. (31) [2]</em></p>
<p>Rattan Singh also chronicles another armoured, helmet wearing Sikh warrior named  Karam Singh who aided Nawab  Dina Beg of Jalandhar in his fight with the invading Gilja Pathans of Ahmed  Shah Durrani:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>There emerged a Singh  warrior from the S. Sham Singh&rsquo;s contingent,<br>
  S. Karam Singh was his name from the village of Paijgarh.<br>
  There did he arm himself with armour and battle dress,<br>
  After he had finished with his ablutions and daily routine. (48)</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Thereafter, did Karam  Singh mount his horse,<br>
  As he resolved to fight for his faith and ideology.<br>
  He was determined to settle scores with the desecrators,<br>
  As he never wished to return without accomplishing this task. (49)</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>After wearing his coat  of arms did he wear a steel helmet,<br>
  As after slinging a sword did he wield a shield in his hand.<br>
  After this, spurring their horse, did he make a move,</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>As he took along those who were dear and loyal to him. (50)</em><br>
  <em>The spot where there  was the highest concentration of Gilja Pathans,<br>
    There did these Singhs arrive to launch an attack.<br>
    As the Pathans were protected by a striking force in the front,<br>
    The Singhs attacked those who were in the vanguard. (51)</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>As this contingent in  the vanguard spotted the advancing Singhs,<br>
  They attacked the Singhs with a lightening speed.<br>
  As the sword of one of them touched Karam Singh&rsquo;s head,<br>
  His turban along with the steel helmet came down. (52)</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Karam Singh, being  bare-headed without his turban,<br>
  Did ply his sword on his Mughal rival&rsquo;s head,<br>
  With a bound did the Pathan fall flat on the ground,<br>
  As Karam Singh&rsquo;s sword had cut through his neck. (53) [3]</em></p>

<p>Although  this evidence suggests Sikh warriors of the second half of the 18th  century did wear helmets, their use seems to be very rare as was access to armour in general. In chronicling the story of Gurbakhsh Singh and his band of  30 Sikh warriors who were martyred at Darbar Sahib at Amritsar in December 1764  fighting against an invading army of Gilja Pathans of Ahmed Shah Durrani, Rattan  Singh describes the Sikhs as wearing turbans and also makes an  important observation regarding their lack of armour:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>On the other side had  Gilja Pathans made elaborate preparations,<br>
  As they had heard about concentration of Singhs in large numbers.<br>
  Gilja Pathans had covered themselves with steel helmets and armours,<br>
  But Singhs had hardly any armours to protect themselves. (49) [4]</em></p>
<p>Existing visual evidence concurrs with this  observation that the use of armour among the Sikhs seems to have been limited during  the 18th century and early parts of the 19th century, or if it was worn, it  would mainly consist of body armour and not helmets. In two rare early 19th  century paintings of Sikh battle scenes, we can see that the Sikh soldiers all  wear traditional turbans rather than helmets and no body armour, other than the  traditional Sikh shield carried on the back. When armour was worn, it   traditionally consisted of the Char-Aina body plates, such as those depicted in  the rare 1780 painting of a son of Sikh chieftan Jassa Singh Ramgharia or the  chain mail body armour worn by the turbaned Sikh soldiers depicted in the  1770-1780 illustrated folio of a battle scene from the manuscript Tawarikh-I  Jahandar Shah.  </p>
