  <h2>Lahore Royal Court</h2>
      
<p>Following the era of the Sikh Misls (Sikh confederacies) of  the 18th century and leading into the early parts of the 19th century as  Maharaja Ranjit Singh consolidated his Empire, we do not find mention of Sikhs  wearing helmets, either in early accounts or images.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Their dress is extremely scanty: a pair of long blue drawers, and a  kind of checkered plaid, a part of which is fastened round the waist, and ther  other thrown over the shoulder, with a mean turban form their clothing and  equipage. The chiefs are distinguished by wearing some heavy gold bracelets on  their wrists, and sometimes a chain of the same metal bound round their  turbans, and by being mounted on better horses: otherwise no distinction  appears amongst them. (Forster, 1798) [1]</em></p>

  <div class="piccaption1">Sikh horsemen, ca. 1814-15</div>
</div>
<p class="indent1"><em>Their horsemen use  swords and spears, and most of them now carry matchlocks, though some still use  the bow and arrow ; a species of arms, for excellence in the use of which their  forefathers were celebrated, and which their descendants appear to abandon with  great reluctance. (Malcom, 1812) [2]</em></p>
<p>This was a time when the Sikh  Kingdom of Lahore was fairly isolated  from the outside world including that of European explorers and travellers.  Although the area of Punjab south of the Sutlej river was open to British  travellers, north of the Sutlej river in the lands under Maharaja Ranjit Singh,  little was known or had been seen.</p>
<p>The first major shift in this isolation occurred with the  meeting between Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the British Governor General of  India, Lord William Bentinck on the banks of the Sutlej river at Ropar in  October 1831. With this meeting came a gradual shift in Maharaja Ranjit Singhs  policy of isolation and the slow but steady procession of travellers to the Lahore  Kingdom began in the 1830&rsquo;s, providing first hand eyewitness accounts of Sikhs  wearing helmets, both in the Royal Courts as well as in the army.</p>
<p>W.G. Osborne the Military Secretary to the Governor-General  of India Lord Auckland who visited the Sikh Kingdom in May 1838 provided the  following detailed description of one of the members of the royal court, Raja  Suchet Singh, brother of minister Dhian Singh: </p>
<p class="indent1"><em>He is high in Runjeet's favour, as well as much respected and admired  by all the Sikhs, and about twenty-eight years of age. His dress was  magnificent; a helmet or scull cap of bright polished steel inlaid with gold,  and a deep fringe of chain mail, of the same material reached to his shoulders,  three plumes of black heron's feathers waving on his crest, and three shawls of  lilac, white, and scarlet, twisted very round and tight, interlaced with one  another and gathered round the edge of the helmet, a chelenk of rubies and  diamonds on his forehead. (Osborne, 1840) [3]</em></p>
<p>In describing this Indo-Persian style helmet with it&rsquo;s kalgi  plumed apex, Osborne provides important details of how turban  material was tied around the  edge of the helmet. This same style of helmet with turban material wrapped  around it was also depicted in a drawing done by Osborne of Raja Sher Singh.</p>

</div>
<p>Baron Charles Hugel who visited Lahore in 1836 provides another  description of Rajah Suchet Singh&rsquo;s helmet:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Kushal Singh, the Jemidar, and Raja Sushet Singh, were the only state  officers present. The last, a very fine distinguished man, wore a black and  gold enameled helmet with the visor open, and ornamented with three large black  herons feathers. (Hugel, 1845) [4]</em></p>
<p>The &lsquo;visor open&rsquo; in Hugel&rsquo;s description refers to the Indo-Persian  helmets nasal-guard in the raised position.</p>
<p>The member of the Lahore Royal Court most often depicted  wearing a helmet is Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s step-son Raja Sher Singh. From  early drawings of the Raja by Osborne and Vigne done between 1836 to 1838 we  see Sher Singh wearing a Indo-Persian style helmet with turban material wrapped  around it&rsquo;s lower edges. When Sher Singh eventually succeeded to the throne of  the Sikh Kingdom in 1841 we still find images of the Maharaja wearing a helmet including  the famous drawing by Prince Soltykoff of  Maharaja Sher Singh and his entourage as  well as a painting done by a native artist showing Maharaja Sher Singh on  horseback with a helmet.</p>
<p>In the latter era of the Sikh Kingdom another member of the  Royal Court, Raja Lal Singh has also been depicted wearing a helmet. Raja  Lal Singh who was appointed Chief Minister in December 1845 and who led Sikh  forces against the British during the First Anglo-Sikh War appears in  two different drawings wearing French cuirass body armour as previously worn in  Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s French General Allard&rsquo;s Curassiers cavalry regiment and  a Indo-Persian style helmet.</p>
<p>Raja Dhian Singh, Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s Prime Minister  also wore a unique type of helmet and details of this are covered in the section on Turban Helmets.</p>
