  <h2>Infantry &amp; Artillery of the Lahore Kingdom</h2>
      
<p>The use of helmets among the army of the Sikh Kingdom of  Lahore seems to have been confined to units of the cavalry. Units of the  infantry wore turbans rather than helmets and a number of early eyewitness accounts bear this out:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>22nd June. - Went to the  parade ground soon after sunrise; Runjeet came to meet us on his elephant about  a mile from it, and we accompanied him to the right of his line of infantry. It  consisted of about twelve thousand men, and reached to the city gates, about  two miles. I never saw so straight or beautiful a line with any troops. They  were all dressed in white with black cross belts, and either a red or yellow  silk turban; armed with muskets and bayonets of excellent manufacture, from  Runjeet's foundry at Lahore. (Osborne, 1840) [1]</em></p>

The Sikh infantry soldier wears a western style uniform with a small turban, while his non-Sikh counterpart wears a shako hat." class="fancybox"><img src="thumbs\thumb_Sikhs9.jpg" width="261" height="300" border="0"></a><br>

<p class="indent1"><em>The only essential  difference between the costume of the troops of Runjeet-Singh and those of  France is, that the former still wear the turban, with their long hair  interlaced with folds of cachmire. The men pride themselves upon their hair;  they connect with it the idea of strength and power. (Interview with General  Allard, 1838) [2]</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The regular infantry,  composed of tall, long-legged men, capable of enduring great fatigue and long  forced marches, is commanded by General Ventura; they are armed with firelocks  and bayonets (of Lahore manufacture). Their uniform is after the French fashion,  scarlet coaties, with green lapells, and worsted epaulets, black belts, tight  breeches, and gaiters buttoned to the knee. The head-dress is a turban, as  nothing could overcome the prejudice against a hat or cap. (Asiatic Journal,  1839) [3]</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The Sikh Sepahis do  not wear gaiters ; and instead of a cap or helmet of any sort, a red cloth is  rolled up, and twisted through and over their hair, so as to form a turban, for  the Sikhs do not shave the head like the Hindus, and when seen on parade at  some little distance, they are scarcely to be distinguished from the Company's  troops. (Vigne, 1840) [4]</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The first grand review  of the whole of Runjeet's regulars assembled at Lahore. We found them, on  coming to the ground, drawn up in line, extending two miles on the banks of the  river, consisting of twenty-eight battalions of infantry and six of cavalry;  altogether about 18,000 men, exceedingly well clothed, and armed in the  European fashion, with the exception of the cap, the aversion to which Runjeet  has never been yet able entirely to overcome in his army: red turbans being  substituted for the shako [a tall, cylindrical military cap], which I am not at  all sure is not an improvement, for a more villanous head-dress than the  present shako never was invented. (Fane, 1842) [5]</em></p>
<div class="picture_left1"><a href="images\art_Sikhs7.jpg" title="A folio from the Military Manual of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Museum, Amritsar, ca. 1830's. The infantry soldiers wear western style uniforms with small cloth turbans." class="fancybox"><img src="thumbs\thumb_Sikhs14.jpg" width="200" height="143" border="0"></a><br>

<p class="indent1"><em>&lsquo;however, the more  closely-fitting dress of an officer belonging to one of the Maharajah's  regiments pointed out that European customs had been adopted to some extent,  but the existing head-dress of crimson or other bright coloured silk still  attests the unwillingness of the Sikh soldier to wear the chako&rsquo; (Barr, 1844) [6]</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The regiments are  indiscrimininately filled with Mussulmans and Sikhs, and wear for head-dress  the pagri of the Punjab, each regiment adopting a distinguishing colour, as  red, blue, green, &amp;c. In other respects they are clothed similarly to the  native troops in the British Indian service. [7]</em></p>
<p>Like the  infantry of the Lahore Kingdom, units of the artillery also did not wear  helmets. William Barr provided the following description of  Sikh artillery  attached to General Court&rsquo;s brigade:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The men dress  something like our own horse artillery, except that, instead of helmets, they  wear red turbans, (the jemadars or officers' being of silk,) which hang down so  as to cover the back part of the neck; white trowsers, with long boots; black  waist and cross belts; and black leather scabbard with brass ornaments. (Barr,  1844) [8]</em></p>
