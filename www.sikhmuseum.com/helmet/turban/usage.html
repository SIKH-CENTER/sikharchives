  <h2>Evidence of Turban Helmet Usage Among the Sikhs</h2>
      
<p>Did the Sikhs of Punjab wear turban helmets? There is no  definitive evidence that conclusively proves that Sikhs ever wore turban  helmets. Of the numerous existing 19th century images of Sikhs  wearing a helmet, not a single image has ever been found to date showing a Sikh  or group of Sikhs wearing a turban helmet.</p>
<p>Without any primary direct evidence, we are only left with   secondary circumstantial evidence  from the  era of the Sikh Kingdom of Maharaja Ranjit Singh that may or may not be references  to turban helmets.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best circumstantial evidence comes from a British military journal describing the October 29, 1831  meeting between Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the British Governor General of  India, Lord William Bentinck at Ropar on the banks of the Sutlej River:</p>
<div class="picture_right1"><a href="images\art_Turban3.jpg" title="Maharaja Ranjit Singh with party. The Maharaja and Sikhs that accompany him wear traditional turbans. ca. early 19th century, Private Collection" class="fancybox"><img src="thumbs\thumb_5.jpg" width="300" height="379" border="0"></a><br>
  <div class="piccaption1">Maharaja Ranjit Singh on horseback</div>
</div>
<p class="indent1"><em>&lsquo;On  the following morning, the 29th, the Governor-General went across the Sutlej to  witness a review of his Highness's forces, amounting to ten or eleven thousand  men. Upon entering the field, a brilliant spectacle presented itself. On the  left, an apparently infinite line of cavalry was drawn up, consisting of five  thousand ghore-churras dressed in yellow, interspersed at intervals with small  bodies of Akalis, dressed in dark blue velved, and high caps surmounted by  quoits. On the right were six battalions of infantry, each one thousand strong.  Their uniform is a red turban, red coat with black belts and yellow facings,  and white trowsers. After these came the horse artillery, consisting of sixteen  guns, the greater part brass, but about six of iron. The carriages were slight  and the horses very indifferent. Mons. Allard's dragoons, about eight hundred  strong, followed these. Their uniform is a steel helmet in the shape of a Sikh  turban, red coats with black belts, white trowsers, and jack boots. Their arms,  the spear, sword, carbine, and pistols.&rsquo; (1832) [1]</em></p>
<p>Reference is made to the cavalry troops of the Dragoon  regiment under Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s French General Jean Francois Allard as  wearing &lsquo;a steel helmet in the shape of a Sikh turban&rsquo;. No further description  of this helmet is given. What type of Sikh turban did this helmet resemble?  There were a number of different turban styles worn by Sikhs in the first half  of the 19th century and specifically in the 1830&rsquo;s as can be seen in  numerous paintings from that era. Without any further description being  provided of the form and functionality of this turban, this account may or may  not be a reference to the same style of turban helmet as the few surviving examples  from Punjab that we have today. Although it is more than likely that this is a  reference to the Punjab turban helmet, at best this account only provides  circumstantial evidence in that regard.</p>
<p>In Lord Wilbraham Egerton&rsquo;s seminal 19th  century work on Indian weapons and armour, he provides the following  description of the Ghouchara Fauj, a branch of the irregular cavalry of  Maharaja Ranjit Singh composed of soldiers from the aristocratic families of  Punjab:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>&lsquo;Some  wore a steel helmet inlaid with gold, and surmounted by the &ldquo;Kalgi&rdquo; a black  heron&rsquo;s plume. Others wore a cap of steel worked like the cuirass in rings.&rsquo;  (Egerton, 1880) [2]</em></p>
<p>While the former helmet seems to be a reference to the  traditional Indo-Persian style of helmet popularly worn by Sikhs of the 19th  century, is the latter reference to a &lsquo;cap of steel&rsquo; a reference to a Punjab  turban helmet?  Egerton only provided a partial quote of a earlier  source of this description in his book. The full reference that Egerton uses provides more details of this helmet worn by the Ghouchara Fauj. Baron  Charles Hugel who visited the Sikh Kingdom of Lahore in 1836 wrote:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>&lsquo;Some  wore a steel helmet, inlaid with gold and surmounted with the kalga or black  heron's plume; others wore a cap of steel, worked like the cuirass in rings:  this cap lies firmly on the turban, and covers the whole head, having openings  for the eyes.&rsquo; (Hugel, 1845) [3]</em></p>
<p>Hugel&rsquo;s additional information makes clear that the &lsquo;cap  of steel&rsquo; that he is referring to and which appears in abbreviated form in  Egertons work is an entirely different type of helmet that covers the entire  head with only openings for the eyes, clearly not the open face-exposing design of a Punjab  turban. The description of the helmet Hugel and Egerton are referring to seems  to be similar to 17th century helmets from Sindh that featured a cap  like upper part of joined small plates with chain mail falling squarely on the  shoulders which covered the whole face with two holes for the eyes (Pant, 1983)  [4]</p>
<p>Although Hugel&rsquo;s reference to a &lsquo;<em>cap of steel</em>&rsquo; describes an entirely different type of helmet and  not a Punjab turban helmet, there are other historical references that mention &lsquo;steel  caps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Lt. William Barr  encountered Sikh troops in 1839  while on a military expedition to Peshawar. While visiting the camp of Prince  Nau Nihal Singh, Maharaja Ranjit Singhs grandson, Lt. Barr observed troops  under Gulab Singh wearing &lsquo;steel caps&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Our  departure was marked by a salute similar to that on our arrival; and though  nearly dark, we proceeded to the tents of the Rajah Gholab Singh, whose visit  the Colonel was desirous to return. His encampment was situated about three  quarters of a mile from the Prince's, and occupied a garden; at one corner of  which a party of horsemen, habited in steel caps, exactly like barbers' basins  in shape, was drawn up, and presented arms as we passed by. (Barr, 1844) [5]</em></p>
<div class="picture_right1"><a href="images\art_Turban5.jpg" title="W.G. Osborne, The Court and Camp of Runjeet Sing (London, 1840), Closeup of Raja Dhian Singh, Maharaja Ranjit Singh's Prime Minister wearing a cap-like helmet." class="fancybox"><img src="thumbs\thumb_7.jpg" width="200" height="137" border="0"></a><br>
  <div class="piccaption1">Dhian Singh's steel cap helmet</div>
</div>
<p>Barr&rsquo;s description of the &lsquo;steel caps&rsquo; being shaped like  &lsquo;barbers basins&rsquo;, suggests the shape of a simple singular bowl shaped helmet, as he does not  make reference to the distinct top-knot dome shape found on Punjab turban  helmets and neither do they resemble a 'barbers basin' in shape. Barr may have been referring to the type of helmet worn by Raja Dhian  Singh which had a simple bowl shape without any secondary top-knot dome. Raja  Dhian Singh was the brother of Raja Gulab Singh whose cavalry troops Barr encountered  wearing these &lsquo;steel caps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sohan Lal Suri, Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s official court  chronicler recorded Maharaja Ranjit Singh inspecting a group of Ghorchurra cavalry  wearing &lsquo;skull caps&rsquo;:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>On the 17th (28th May 1838 A.D.) 200 horsemen of the Ghorchara Khas  stood well-equipped and well-dressed in brocade, with gold and silver saddles  and gold-threaded skull caps. The Maharaja inspected them one by one separately  and ordered the Raja Kalan to establish them on both sides outside the special  portico on the arrival of the glorious Sahibs so that they might feel pleased  to see their garments, their horses and their fine armour.</em> [6]</p>
<p>Suri mentions that the helmets were 'gold-threaded skull caps'. This may be yet another reference to the type of helmet worn by Raja Dhian Singh, Osborne's drawing of which show a string of jewels wrapped around the singular cap-like bowl   and likely used to help hold the helmet in place.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the term &lsquo;steel cap&rsquo; has  also been used to describe a more traditional Indo-Persian style helmet as  well. Lt. Barr provides the following description of General Allard&rsquo;s Cuirassiers:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The  uniform consisted of a short blue coat and a pair of dark trousers with a  narrow red stripe tightly strapped over Wellington boots and spurs. The cuirass  was of highly polished steel, or brass, and bore a Gallic cock in the centre of  the breast plate. The head-dress was a round steel cap from the apex of which  sprung a red horse hair plume. From the cap depended a curtain of chain mail,  which hung down over the neck and shoulders. The arms consisted of a flint-lock  carbine, and a long steel sword depending from the waist-belt by steel chains.  (Barr, 1839) [7]</em></p>
<p>The Cuirassiers wore a hemispherical helmet with a  singular porte-aigrette plume holder at its apex with a kalgi plume. We have  visual evidence of this, as Dr. John Martin Honigberger in his memoirs Thirty-Five  Years in the East (London, 1852), provided a drawing of a helmeted Sikh  Cuirrassier which exactly matches Barr&rsquo;s description.</p>
<p>Lt. Colonel Steinbach who spent 9 years in the Lahore  army during the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Maharaja Sher Singh writes:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The  cavalry wear helmets or steel caps, round which shawls or scarfs are folded.  (Steinbach, 1845) [8]</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The  arms, which are principally made at Lahore, consist of swords, spears,  matchlocks, muskets, pistols, and armour, the latter being composed of helmets  or skull-caps, coats of mail, breatplates, gauntlets, and shields. (Steinbach,  1845) [9]</em></p>
<p>Steinbach differentiates between &lsquo;<em>helmets</em>&rsquo; and what he calls &lsquo;<em>steel  caps</em>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<em>skull-caps</em>&rsquo;. It is  possible that this cap-like helmet may be a reference to a Punjab turban helmet  but without any further details or description this cannot be definitively discerned.</p>
<p>Two other early European references to the Dragoon  cavalry regiments of the Sikh cavalry under the command of French General, Jean  Francois Allard make references to &lsquo;<em>close-fitting  steel helmets&rsquo;</em>.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The regular cavalry was formed by  M. Allard, and is disciplined in the system of the French lancers and dragoons.  The uniform of the former is blue with red facings; they are armed with the  Polish lance, a light sabre, and pistols. M. Allard represents the men as  docile, with excellent qualities for soldiers. The dragoons are a fine body of  men, armed with swords, pistols, and long carbines; their clothing is scarlet,  with green facings, long jack-boots and buckskins, with black belts, and  close-fitting steel helmets. (Asiatic Journal, 1839) [10]</em></p>
<p class="indent1"><em>The Dragoons are fine men, armed  with long carbines, pistols and swords. Their appointments are of black  leather, with jack boots. Clothing scarlet, with green facings, and close  fitting steel helmets, of the Roman pattern. (Oriental Herald, 1838) [11]</em></p>
<p>The fact that these  helmets are described as &lsquo;close fitting&rsquo; in both accounts is an indication that  they may be smaller than the traditional Indo-Persian style worn by the  overwhelming majority of armored Sikhs during the 19th century. The  reference from the Oriental Herald also provides further important details of  this helmet and mentions that the &lsquo;<em>close  fitting steel helmets</em>&rsquo; are &lsquo;<em>of the  Roman pattern</em>&rsquo;. </p>
<div class="picture_right1"><a href="images\art_Turban2.jpg" title="ca. 1st century B.C. Coolus-Mannheim Roman Helmet, Badische Landesmuseum Karlsruhe. Found in the Rhine at Mannheim" class="fancybox"><img src="thumbs\thumb_4.jpg" width="200" height="148" border="0"></a><br>
  <div class="piccaption1">Coolus-Mannheim Roman Helmet</div>
</div>
<p>Although Roman  helmets varied in their design and form over the centuries, the Coolus-Mannheim  style Roman helmet prevalent during the 1st Century B.C., and worn  by Caesar's legions, during his conquest of Gaul [12] bears the strongest  resemblance to the form of a Punjab turban helmet. Military reforms and the  need to contain costs during the campaigns of Caesar, led to a progressive  simplification of the Roman helmet during this specific time period. The  simplified design of the Coolus-Mannheim helmet as a hemispherical bronze cap  with minimal decorative elements, lack of cheek-pieces and no neck roll at the  back or minimal and without a button or any other ornamental element at its  apex at first glance make for a strong resemblance to the shape of a Punjab  turban helmet and that is what the author may have been trying to describe when  he mentioned its similarity to a Roman helmet.</p>
<p>While most of these European eyewitness accounts refer to  General Allards Dragoon regiment of the cavalry as wearing &lsquo;steel caps&rsquo;,  another reference to soldiers wearing &lsquo;steel cap&rsquo; helmets can be found in the  memoirs of G.T. Vigne who visited the Lahore Kingdom in 1836. While reviewing  the troops of Maharaja Ranjit Singh under the command of his other French  General, Jean-Baptise Ventura, Vigne observed the following:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>We  passed down the line of four or five regiments with Runjit, who, from time to  time, asked the Baron for his opinion. In the centre was drawn up what is  called the Bande-a-casque,—a solid mass of about thirty buglemen, in steel  skull-caps, who were blowing with all their might, knowing nothing of music,  and making a most horrible din. (Vigne, 1840) [13]</em><br>
