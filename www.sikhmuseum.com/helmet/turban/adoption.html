  <h2>Rarity and Rates of Adoption of the Punjab Turban Helmet</h2>
      
<p>Although there is no definitive evidence to date proving  that Sikhs wore  Punjab turban helmets, if we look at the collective body of  secondary circumstantial evidence, it meets the threshold of evidence to allow  us to make the assumption that they may likely have. If that is the case, then  the most important question becomes why is this style helmet so rare and why  did the Punjab turban helmet never achieve the level of popularity and high  rate of adoption among Sikhs wearing helmets that the Indo-Persian style helmet  did?</p>
<p>Looking at the number of 19th century or  earlier helmets attributed to Punjab or the Sikhs, we find that there are less  than a handful of surviving Punjab turban style helmets in existence in various  museum and private collections around the world. On the other hand there are  literally hundreds, if not thousands of surviving Indo-Persian style helmets  attributed to Punjab and the Sikh Empire in various collections. Visual evidence of  many paintings and drawings of Sikhs wearing the Indo-Persian style helmet  provide conclusive proof that this style of helmet achieved overwhelming broad appeal in  Punjab.  The large disparity in adoption indicates that the Punjab turban helmet never  achieved anywhere near the level of popularity or appeal that the traditional  Indo-Persian style helmet did among 19th century Sikhs of the Sikh  Empire in Punjab.</p>
<p>Of the surviving Punjab turban helmets in existence,  although they share a similar general design of a main hemispherical bowl  surmounted with a secondary smaller dome and the attachment of a camail of  chain mail to the lower edges; their decorative design varies. In  fact of all of the surviving turban helmets, there are no two helmets which are  identical. Each surviving turban helmet has a distinct and unique design in  terms of the gold inlay pattern work as well as the proportions and shape of  the top-knot secondary domes. Unlike the Indo-Persian style helmets, where multiple  examples of the same style of helmet exist, the distinct uniqueness of each of  the surviving Punjab turban helmets indicate that they were not standardized or  produced in any substantial numbers during their manufacture, for example to  equip a group of soldiers with one style of helmet. Instead  the Punjab turban helmets seem to have been produced in extremely small  quantities, likely commissioned as &lsquo;one-off&rsquo; helmets, each produced by a  different artisans or craftsmen, thus accounting for the existing variations  among the surviving Punjab turban helmets.</p>

<p>A display at the Royal Armouries featuring a Punjab  turban helmet next to a traditional Indo-Persian style helmet attributed to  Lahore reveals some striking differences between the two which may account for  the relative lack of popularity or sucess of the turban helmet compared to the popular  Indo-Persian style helmet among 19th century Sikhs of the Sikh Empire.</p>
<p>In terms of their relative size, there is a significant  variation between the two helmets, with the Indo-Persian style helmet providing  much more head protection with a larger main hemispherical bowl which would  cover more of the wearers head than the turban helmet with its elliptical bowl  and concave sides. The turban helmet also lacks the sliding nasal guard found  on Indo-Persian helmets and thus provides no protection to the face of the  wearer. These two characteristics mean that the Punjab turban helmet provided  less safety and protection for the wearer compared to the   Indo-Persian style helmet.</p>
<p>Another  function of battle helmets, beyond  providing safety for the head that was very important was the general  appearance of the helmet in terms of its grandeur and intimidation factor  directed towards the enemy on the battlefield or other soldiers of the Sikh Empire. Looking at the  two helmets at the Royal Armouries  display, one can observe that the Indo-Persian style helmet appears much grander  and provides a more intimidating form than the relatively benign turban helmet beside it.  During this era, troops of Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s cavalry were required to  purchase their own horses, weapons and clothing. There was also a sense or  rivalry among the troops as they would try to make the grandest or most imposing  form compared to their contemporaries and in that regard the Indo-Persian style  helmet fills that role better than does the Punjab turban helmet.</p>
<p>Description of cavalry officers under the command of its  European Generals Jean Baptise Ventura and Claude Auguste Court:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Almost every one of  the Sikh officers of these regular troops was dressed according to his own  taste; some in English, others in French uniform, or in a mixture of both; some  wore turbans, or caps with shawls wrapped round them, and others helmets and  chakos: some had high boots with coloured tops, other shoes; some wore white,  and others coloured pantaloons. (von Orlich, 1845) [1]</em></p>

  <div class="piccaption1">Sikh helmet with kalgi plumes</div>
</div>
<p>One of the key elements of helmet design that was so  important to the Sikhs in terms of grandeur or intimidation was the kalgi plume  and the helmets of the Sikh Empire were specially designed to optimize and maximize the display  of these plumes. It was a sign of status among Sikh Sardars and men of  importance to wear a large kalgi plume or set of plumes in their turbans or  helmets.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Plumes  have been made of herons' feathers in many countries, and here they are in  great request, as no Sikh officer of any rank is ever seen without one in his  turban ; and in those of the Surdars, or great men, the feathers, generally an  uneven number, between ten and twenty, are fastened into a funnel-shaped stem,  entirely covered with gold wire or thread, or sometimes richly ornamented with  pearls, emeralds, and rubies. (Vigne,1842) [2]</em></p>
<p>In fact one of the key design elements that helps  distinguish the style of Indo-Persian style helmets preferred by Sikhs as  compared to those worn in Asia and Persia, was the prominence in the design  given to porte-aigrette plume holder rather than a central spike at the very  apex of the helmet to hold high a large bhatka kalgi plume, sometimes up to a  foot in length or more. This prominent kalgi plume holder at the very top of  the helmet is usually accompanied by two other porte-aigrette plume holders. In  the Punjab turban helmets there is no kalgi plume holder at the apex of the  helmet except in one helmet [3] and in general the helmets have none or a  minimal configuration of plume holders. This de-emphasis of the kalgi plume in  the Punjab turban helmet design may have significantly contributed to their lack  of popularity among the Sikhs and instead the overwhelming preference for the Indo-Persian  style helmet with its design optimized to prominently display the  kalgi plumes on the wearers head.</p>
<p>Although today the Punjab turban helmet is commonly  thought by many to be the quintessential and most common type of armoured  helmet worn by the Sikhs of the Sikh Kingdoms of the 19th century,  evidence indicates that this was never  the case as the Punjab turban helmet  failed to achieve any popularity among helmet wearing soldiers or nobles of the Sikh Empire, who overwhelmingly preferred the Indo-Persian style helmet.</p>
<p>The Punjab turban helmet represents a historic anomaly  and was extremely rare even during the time of its manufacture and usage in the  Sikh Empire and never achieved much popularity in the Sikh Empire due to a  number of factors including its design. Its usage seems to have been primarily  confined to a very tiny sample size of the cavalry of the Lahore Empire. </p>
<p>The Punjab turban helmet represents a truly unique and  rare anomaly in the history of Sikh armour. Given its lack of popularity,  overwhelming preference for the Indo-Persian style helmet and the extremely low  rates of its manufacture and usage it is quite incredible that any of these  rare types of helmets have survived at all.</p>
