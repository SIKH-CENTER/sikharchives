  <h2>General Allard's Dragoons</h2>
  <p>Although we have no conclusive proof of Sikhs wearing  turban helmets, circumstantial evidence based on descriptive written accounts  of European visitors to the Sikh Empire seem to suggest that a  branch of the cavalry raised by Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s French General Jean  Francois Allard may have worn the Punjab style turban helmet. It is General  Allard&rsquo;s Dragoons that have been referred to as wearing &lsquo;<em>a steel helmet in the shape of a Sikh turban&rsquo; (United Service Journal,  1832), &lsquo;</em><em>close-fitting steel helmets&rsquo; (Asiatic Journal, 1839), </em>and &lsquo;<em>close  fitting steel helmets, of the Roman pattern&rsquo; (Oriental Herald, 1838)</em>.</p>
  <p>Since most written  accounts and visual evidence corroborate that the Indo-Persian style helmet was  the overwhelming choice of helmet preferred by the Sikhs of Punjab, why would  the Dragoons under the command </p>

  <p>of General Allard possibly wear a different  style helmet? It is plausible that General Allard may have modeled the Punjab  turban helmet worn by his troops after the casque helmet worn by Cuirassier cavalry  regiments of the France Empire. A hemispherical domed helmet the French casque  features an ornate front-facing decorative fin at its apex, which in some ways  resembles the top-knot dome of the Punjab turban helmet. Although we have no  direct evidence, it is possible that the Punjab turban helmet may have had its  design influenced by the French casque, with the floriated pattern work and camail  of chain mail influences coming from the more popular Indo-Persian helmets worn in  Punjab.</p>
<p>If General Allard&rsquo;s  Dragoons represented the primary wearers of the Punjab turban helmet it then becomes  important to try to identify exactly how Dragoons there may have been in order  to estimate the potential number of turban helmets in use.</p>
<p>General Allard raised the first European style cavalry  regiments in the Sikh Kingdom in 1822, the Rajman Khas Lansia (Lancer Regiment)  and Rajman Daragun Anwal (Dragoon Regiment) [1] </p>
<p>The number of men in  a cavalry regiment varied considerably over time during the Sikh Empire, the  smallest on record numbering just 98 men. Most regiments fell somewhere in the  range of 200 to 500 men in the 1830&rsquo;s during the time of General Allard and 250  to 700 men in the 1840&rsquo;s during the post-Ranjit Singh era of the Empire. [2]</p>
<p>As part of the Fauj-i-khas (royal army), the initial single  Dragoon cavalry regiment raised by General Allard in 1822 may have comprised approximately  500 men if we use the upper range of regimental numbers in the 1830&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>At the October 29, 1831 meeting between Maharaja Ranjit  Singh and the British Governor General of India, Lord William Bentinck at Ropar,  800 of General Allard&rsquo;s cavalry troops wearing a &lsquo;steel helmet&rsquo; were described  as being in attendance <em>(Oriental Herald, 1838)</em>.</p>
<p>By 1829, General Allard&rsquo;s cavalry had grown to 3,000 men  composed of 1 regiment of Lancers and 2 Regiments of Dragoons (Masson, 1844) [3].  Using a 2/3 ratio, this would mean approximately 2,000 Dragoons at this time.</p>
<p>By 1838 the number of Dragoons under General Allard  reached their largest number of men. In 1838, the regular Sikh cavalry numbered  4,000 men, composed of 2 regiments of Lancers and 6 regiments of Dragoons  (Oriental Herald, 1838) [4]. Using a 6/8 radio this would mean that there were  approximately 3,000 Dragoons at this time.</p>
<p>Following General Allard&rsquo;s death in 1838 priorities  shifted within the Fauj-i-khas and by 1845 before the battle of the Sutlej in  the first Anglo-Sikh War, there was only one regiment of Dragoons totalling 750  men [5].</p>
<p>In 1838 the strength of Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s cavalry  was estimated at 40,000 men [6]. Even at  their 1838 numerical height of 3,000, the  Dragoons would only have represented 7.5% of Sikh cavalry. Furthermore it is  important to note that not all of the Dragoons would have worn a turban helmet  as helmets and armour in general were expensive and had to be purchased. Helmets for the most part would were in the  realm of possibility for officers and senior personnel. Captain  Leopold von Orlich on his 1843 visit to the Lahore Royal Court made the  following observation regarding the regular cavalry troops under the command of  General Ventura and General Court at the time:</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Almost  every one of the Sikh officers of these regular troops was dressed according to  his own taste; some in English, others in French uniform, or in a mixture of  both; some wore turbans, or caps with shawls wrapped round them, and others  helmets and chakos: some had high boots with coloured tops, other shoes; some  wore white, and others coloured pantaloons. (Orlich, 1845) [7]</em></p>
<p>Out of the 3,000 Dragoons in 1838,  perhaps only 800 may have been senior ranking officers who may have worn armour  including a turban helmet. During the 1831 meeting at Ropar between Maharaja  Ranjit Singh and British Governor General Lord William Bentinck, only the most  senior officers would have been present, the report of 800 of General Allard&rsquo;s  cavalry troops wearing a &lsquo;steel helmet&rsquo;, likely represents these senior  officers, potentially wearing a Punjab turban helmet.</p>
<p>There are some references to General Allard&rsquo;s Dragoons where  they are described as wearing turbans and not helmets, further corroboration of  the fact that the usage of helmets was not  uniform or consistent even among  the the Dragoons themselves.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>We left Pubbee at  sunrise, and had proceeded about six miles, when we were met by a party of  Allard's dragoons, sent by Colonel Wade to escort us to his camp, and who, as  we approached them, formed up on one side of the road and saluted us by drawing  their right hands to the forehead…</em> <em>Their trousers are long, of dark blue cloth, with a red stripe; and  their turbans of crimson silk, brought somewhat into a peak in front, and  ornamented in the centre with a small brass half-moon, from which springs a  glittering sprig about two inches in height. (Barr, 1839) [8]</em></p>
<p>If we assume that all of the senior officers of the  Dragoon regiments wore turban helmets this would mean that the potential pool  of possible Punjab turban helmet wearing troops would only have been 800 men (Ropar  meeting). Out of a cavalry of 40,000, this represents only a sample size of only  2% potential Punjab turban helmet wearing soldiers. Such a small number may explain why there are so few surviving Punjab turban helmets today.</p>
