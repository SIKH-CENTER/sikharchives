          <p class="headline1">Vars of Bhai Gurdas</p>
          <p>Bhai Gurdas (1551 – 1629), eminent  scholar, scribe of the first version of the Guru Granth Sahib under the  direction of Guru Arjan and poet provides the  earliest biographical account of Guru Nanak. Bhai Gurdas mentions that  Guru Nanak wore blue on his journey to Mecca. The Guru likely did this to  blend in with other Muslims on pilgrimage to the restricted city.</p>
<div class="body_indent1">

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Bhai Gurdas also provides a few other references  to colors in his writings:

          <p class="headline1">Rahitnamas</p>
          <p>Rahitnamas  are  early formative documents of the Sikh Code of Conduct written in the  1700’s. They were written by a number of authors claiming to be records of Guru  Gobind Singhs final wishes to the Khalsa on how Sikhs should lead their life.  Although it is generally agreed that many of these were likely written in the  post-Guru era, they are still valuable in revealing early Sikh community interpretations  and practices in the lifetime of their respective authors.</p>
          <p>No  reference is made to the color of Nishan Sahibs in these early codes of  conduct, but a pattern does emerge of a distaste or prohibition against red. The  exact reason for this remains unclear and the autors attributed the prohibition to Guru Gobind Singh. The abhorrence of red may have  been a result of 18th century Sikhs trying to distance themselves  from association with the religion and practices of the Hindus. Red being an  important color in the Hindu faith worn by their holy men as a symbol of  worldly renunciation and appearing on their religious banners.</p>
<div class="body_indent1">
            <p><strong>Chaupa Singh  Rahit-nama (c 1740&rsquo;s)</strong><br>

          <p class="headline1">Bahi Khan Singh Nabha</p>
          <p> Sikh scholar Bhai Khan Singh Nabha in his 20th century encyclopedic  work Gurmat Martand provides an interesting interpretation regarding this prohibition  against wearing red:</p>
<div class="body_indent1">
            <p><em>Suha  (pothohari): red. Because it is a colour associated with women&rsquo;s clothing red  is inappropriate for the manly</em> [3] </p>
          </div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="headline1">Sri Gur Panth Prakash</p>
          <p>Sri  Gur Panth Prakash commonly known as Prachin Panth Prakash written by Rattan  Singh Bhangoo [4] is considered one of the primary historical chronicles and  seminal detailed works about the origin and evolution of the Khalsa Panth,  during the 18th century. The author Rattan Singh Banghu started the  work in 1809 and completed it in 1841. Noted scholar Bhai Vir Singh discovered  the original manuscript in 1914, editing and published it that year.</p>
          <p>Ratan  Singh Bhangu drew upon available Sikh sources such as Janamsakhis and  Gurbilases and on the oral history tradition passed down to him from his  family. His paternal grandfather was the famous Sikh martyr Matab Singh and his  maternal grandfather Sham Singh was the leader of the Karorasirighia Misl.  Prachin Panth Prakash is one of the few existing historical Sikh sources of  information that we have about the establishment of early Sikh rule in the  Punjab during the time of Banda Singh Bahadur.</p>
          <p>Rattan  Singh relates the  story of Guru Gobind Singh wearing blue to  disguise himself as a Muslim holy man in order to escape Mughal authorities  hunting for him:</p>
<div class="body_indent1">
            <p><strong>Episode  20, The Episode About Machhiwara</strong><br>
              <em>Then Satguru called  one Sayyad to join his two Pathan followers,<br>
              And ordered for  different kinds of dresses to be made.<br>
              Thereafter, they  changed their apparels to look like Hajj pilgrims<br>
            By wearing long blue  robes and throwing loose their hair upon their backs. (8)</em></p>
          </div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>A  significant portion of Prachin Panth Prakash details the split of the Khalsa  Panth into two rival camps in the post-Guru era. The Tatt Khalsa  faction led by Guru Gobind Singhs widow Mata Sundri and the Bandai faction let  by followers of Banda Singh Bahadur clashed on a number of issues including their interpretation of colors. We  also see mentions of the prohibitions of red  found  in early Rahitnamas and references to the growing popularity of blue.</p>
<div class="body_indent1">
            <p><strong>Episode  60</strong><br>
              <em>The red robes which  the Guru had prohibited him from wearing,<br>
              He started wearing  those very robes out of obduracy.<br>
              Doing away with the  Guru-ordained greetings &ldquo;Waheguru ji ki Fateh&rdquo;,<br>
            He introduced his own  brand of greetings &ldquo;Fateh Darshan&rdquo;. (32)</em></p>
            <p><em>He dispensed with the  blue robes,<br>
              And ordained (his  followers) to wear red-coloured head gear.<br>
              He banned the  partaking of non-vegetarian animal food,<br>
              So much so that even  the wood for fuel was to be washed. (33)</em></p>
            <p><strong>The Factional Fight Between (Tat Khalsa) Singhs and Bandhayee  Singhs</strong><br>
              <em>They declared &ldquo;Fateh  Darshan&rdquo; against Khalsa&rsquo;s &ldquo;Waheguru ji ki Fateh&rdquo;,<br>
              They were Bishnois  against Khalsa&rsquo;s casteless fraternity.<br>
              They donned red robes  against Khalsa&rsquo;s rejection of such robes,<br>
            The Khalsa donned  blue robes against their dislike of blue robes. (14)</em></p>
<p><strong>Episode 60</strong><br>
    <em>Miri Singh, who was  the eldest son of Baba Kahan Singh,<br>
    Had participated in a  wrestling bout against the Bandhayee Singhs.<br>
    He used to remain in  the close company of Guru Gobind Singh,<br>
    Whom the Guru had  initiated with his own hands. (61)</em></p>
            <p><em>He observed wearing  blue robes and steel rings,<br>
              And never associated  with Meenas, Masands and those indulging in female infanticide.<br>
              He never had any  dealings with the followers of Ram Rai,<br>
            And would harass and  kill those belonging to Banda Singh&rsquo;s faction. (62)</em></p>
            <p><strong>The Factional Fight Between (Tat Khalsa) Singhs and Bandhayee  Singhs</strong><br>
              <em>Donning the blue  robes and steel rings,<br>
              He followed the  initiated Singhs code of conduct.<br>
              Reciting the Sikh  scriptures and making prayers everyday,<br>
            He did not shirk from  fighting and rioting (against his enemies). (3)          </em></p>
