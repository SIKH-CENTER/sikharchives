<p>As  Europeans began to explore South Asia they come into more frequent contact with  Sikhs in the late 1700’s and early 1800’s. This is the time when the early western  accounts of Sikhs start to appear a little more than 60 years after the time of  Guru Gobind Singh. There are numerous references to colors. Although there are  references to white and yellow, the majority of these early accounts indicate that  blue seemed to have been the most popular color among the Sikhs at that time.</p>

<div class="body_indent1">
  <p><strong>History  of the Jats, Pathans and Sikhs, ca. 1768<br>
    Francis  Xavier Wendel</strong><br>
    <em>He did more: having  returned from his reveries, whether true or feigned, having showed his  disciples the arms that Baba-Nanec had presented them with, he himself limited  their mode of dressing and colour that he said he had been inspired to make  known to them, that is, to let their hair and beards grow, to dress in no  colour but blue, made of indigo.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Du  Perron&rsquo;s Indian Researches, ca. 1788</strong><br>
    <em>Poor or rich they  are always dressed in blue.&rdquo;…&rdquo;Their weapons are the lance, the saber and the  shield.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>A  Treatise on the History, Religion and Culture of the Sikhs, ca. 1787</strong><br>
    <strong>Antoine  Louis Henri Polier</strong><br>
    <em>Their Dress is  extremely scanty, a pair of blue Drawers, a kind of chequered Plaid worn partly  round the middle and partly over the shoulder with a mean blue Turban forms all  their Equipage.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Treatise  on the Sikhs, ca. 1788<br>
    Lt.  Col. James Browne</strong><br>
    <em>&ldquo;their dress is dark  blue, as ordered by Gooroo Gobind, and gives them, when collected in large  bodies together, a very dismal appearance.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The  History of the Reign of Shah-Aulum, the Present Emperor of Hindostaun, ca. 1798<br>
    William  Francklin</strong><br>
    <em>The dress of the  males consists of a coarse cloth of blue cotton, thrown loosely over the  shoulders, and coming down between the legs, is confined round the waist by a  belt of cotton. An ample turban of blue cloth covers the head, and over this is  frequently wore a sash of silk and cotton mixed, resembling both in colour and  pattern a Scotch Tartan.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Memoir  of the War in India,  ca. 1806<br>
    William  Thorn</strong><br>
    <em>They differ from the  rest of the Hindoos in the article of dress no otherwise than by giving the  preference to blue cotton cloths, and silks of the same colour.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>A  Translation of the Seir Mutaqharin, ca. 1789<br>
    Ghulam  Hussain Khan, translated by M. Raymond, 1789</strong><br>
    <em>They form a  particular society as well as a sect, which distinguishes itself by wearing  almost always blue cloaths (v), and going armed at all times.</em></p>
  <p><em>(v) It is true that  they wear only a short blue jacket, and blue longdraws: but they use likewise  the yellow and the white in their turbans, as well as the blue, although by the  by the latter is the general colour.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>A  Translation of the Seir Mutaqharin (The Review of Modern Times) ca. 1763<br>
    Mir  Ghulam Hussain Khan, translated by M. Raymond, ca. 1789</strong><br>
    <em>The Sycks are Deists  in the strictest sense of the word, and of course, perfectly tolerant and  harmless; although as soldiers, they are, like the Marhattas, merciless  plunderers, and incessant skirmishers. The ceremony of the reception of a  Proselyte consists in no more than these two articles: to put on a short dress,  of a blue colour, from head to foot; and to let one&rsquo;s hair grow from head to foot,  without ever cutting or clipping or shaving it. One day I got within one of  their temples, invited thereto by the tingling of the cymbals: on appearing  within the door, an old venerable man bid me leave my slippers, as none could  enter, but bare-footed. This admonition I obeyed, and went into a hall covered  with carpets, at the northern part of which, there were several cushions  covered with a yellow veil, under which, I was told lay Nanec-Shah&rsquo;s book, who  is their legislator. At the southern end of the hall, there were fifteen or  twenty men all in blue, and with long beards, sitting, some armed and some not.  At the eastern side, but very near to it, two old men with a small drum and a  pair of cymbals, were singing some maxims of morality out of that Book, and  this they did with a deal of enthusiasm and contortion. On getting within the  hall, I saluted the company, which returned the salute, and returned it again  when I came out.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Sketches  Chiefly Relating to the History, Religion, Learning, and Manners of the Hindoos,  ca. 1790, Quintin Craufurd</strong><br>
    <em>Blue, which is  generally considered as an inauspicious colour by the Hindoos, distinguishes  the dress of the Seiks; as if Nanuck meant to show by this, the weakness and  absurdity of superstitious prejudices. Their dress commonly consists in blue  trowsers of cotton cloth; a sort of plaid generally checkered with blue, which  is thrown over the right shoulder, and a blue turban.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>A  Journey from Bengal to England,  ca. 1783<br>
    George  Forster, 1783</strong><br>
    <em>In this matter I  speak from personal knowledge, having in the course of my journey seen two of  their parties, each of which amounted to about two hundred horsemen. They were  clothed in white vests, (lxvii) and their arms were preserved in good order<br>
      lxvii : A long calico  gown, having a close body and sleeves with a white skirt.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Containing  Information Respecting the Character of the Inhabitants on the Banks of the  Indus, ca. 1794, John Griffith</strong><br>
    They sometimes wear  yellow, but the prevailing Colour of their Clothes is deep blue; They make  their Turbans capaciously large, over which they frequently wear a piece of  pliable Iron Chain or Net work.</p>
