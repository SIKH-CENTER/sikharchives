                      <p>Buckam Singh was eligible for two medals for his military service while his mother and wife were eligible for a cross and plaque as the widow and mother of a soldier killed in service.

The Memorial Plaque was issued after the First World War to the next-of-kin of all British and Empire (now Commonwealth) service personnel who lost their lives as a result of the war.
                    The plaques, of about 5 inches (120 mm) in diameter and cast in bronze, were designed by the eminent sculptor and medallist, Edward Carter Preston. The figure of Britannia, classically robed and helmeted, standing facing right, holding a modest laurel wreath crown in her extended left hand and supporting a trident by her right side with her right arm and hand. In the foreground a male lion stands facing right. The text arranged around the edge of the piece reads: 'HE+DIED+FOR+FREEDOM+ +AND+HONOUR'. Each plaque had the name of the soldier commemorated, individually embossed as part of the design. The soldiers full name was given without any indication of rank or honours to show equality of sacrifice of all those who lost their lives. A scroll seven inches wide by eleven inches in height was designed to accompany the plaque and was of thick paper bearing the following message -     'He whom this scroll commemorates was numbered among those who, at the call of King and Country, left all that was dear to them, endured hardness, faced danger, and finally passed out of the sight of men by the path of duty and self-sacrifice, giving up their own lives that others might live in freedom. Let those who come after see to it that his name is not forgotten.' A plaque and scroll were awarded to Buckam Singh's mother. <br>
                    The medal shown belonged to a Sikh of the British Indian Army, awarded to: BUDH SINGH
