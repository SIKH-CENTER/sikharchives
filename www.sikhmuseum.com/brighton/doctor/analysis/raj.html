  <img src="images\Raj1.jpg" width="600" height="390">
  <p>The concept of &lsquo;white supremacy&rsquo; was one of the  cornerstones of the British Raj. There was a great debate in the British  government on how this concept might be detrimentally affected  by allowing Indian troops to fight &lsquo;white&rsquo; troops in a European war. To  maintain &lsquo;white prestige&rsquo;, Indian troops had not been used in combat in the  Boer War. The decision to deploy Indian troops in France at the advent of World  War I was made more out of necessity, rather than ideology. On August 5, 1914,  the day after Britain declared war on Germany, the War Council recommended that  India send the Lahore and Meerut infantry divisions to France and a cavalry brigade  to Egypt. [1]</p>
  <p>Having made the critical decision to employ Indian troops  in Europe and now faced with the prospect of wounded Indian soldiers on British  soil, it became clear that the fate of the Imperial Raj and its prestige could  easily be undermined if care was not taken to properly manage the situation. Sir Walter Lawrence initially felt that offering medical  care to the wounded Indian soldier&rsquo;s equivalent to their British counterparts  might encourage the Indians to start entertaining subversive ideas about racial  equality, which might have undermined the prestige of British Rule in India.  [2] Yet he also realized that the conditions and administration of the Indian  hospitals of Brighton would inevitably become known in India and offering  inferior care would be met in India with strong disapproval. As Lawrence put  it, British India was &lsquo;on trial&rsquo; within their walls. [3]</p>
  <p> The racial and  social hierarchy so carefully cultivated in the British Empire was firmly rooted in the belief that a separation between 'whites' and Indians had to be maintained. Otherwise an over familiarity between the rulers and the ruled would subvert the relations  underpinning imperial domination. [4] This fear was one of the primary reasons why contact between Brighton hospital patients and the people of the town were strictly limited.</p>
  <p>Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India between  1899 and 1905, expressed concern that &lsquo;<em>at  home every man with a turban, a sufficient number of jewels and a black skin is  mistaken for a miniature Akbar, and becomes the darling of drawing rooms, the  honoured guest of municipalities and the hero of the newspapers</em>&rsquo;. [5]</p>
  <p>Another major concern of the authorities was related to the  concept of 'izzat' or 'honour' as it specifically related to the issue of 'white women'. The British had a innate fear that any liaisons between Indians and British women would bring dishonour not only upon their women but the prestige of the Raj itself. Such liasoins were strongly discouraged  in British India and now at the Brighton hospitals as well.</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>E.B. Howell<br>
      Censor's Report, June 19, 1915<br>
      '<em>The troops in hospital rather resent their close surveillance, but it is obviously better to keep a tight hand than allow them to conceive a wrong idea of the 'Izzat' of the English women. A sentiment which if not properly held in check would be most detrimental to the prestige and spirit of European rule in India.</em>' [6]</p>
  </div>
  <p>The establishment of the Brighton hospitals had  not been based on political necessity, but it now became critical that they  become the flagships of imperial benevolence in order to promote the British  Raj.</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>Sir Walter Lawrence to Lord Kitchener, early 1915<br>
      <em>&lsquo;I never lose an opportunity of  impressing on all who are working in these hospitals that great political  issues are involved in making the stay of these Indians as agreeable as  possible.&rsquo;</em> [7]</p>
  </div>
  <p>Care of the Indian patients in Brighton through the instrument of imperial benevolence became a political necessity.  The British government and the Government of India could not afford to alienate  the moderate nationalists and the more traditional elements that were the  bulwark of British power in India. [8] Emphasizing the paternalistic nature of  relations in the Indian Army, one soldier likened the bedside manner of British  medical officers to the &lsquo;kindness of fathers to sons&rsquo;.

    <p>Subedar-Major [Sardar Bahadur Gugan] (6th Jats, 50) to a  friend (India) [Hindi]<br>
      Brighton Hospital, early January 1915<br>
      <em>&lsquo;We are in England. It is a very fine  country. The inhabitants are very amiable and are very kind to us, so much so  that our own people could not be as much so. The food, the clothes and the  buildings are very fine. Everything is such as one would not see even in a  dream. One should regard it as fairyland. The heart cannot be satiated with  seeing the sights, for there is no other place like this in the world. It is as  if one were in the next world. It cannot be described. A motor car comes to  take us out. The King and Queen talked with us for a long time. I have never  been so happy in my life as I am here.&rsquo;</em> [10]</p>

      England (Urdu) 								April 13, 1915<br>
      <em>'I am in the English hospital.  The English doctors pay great attention to the Indian sick.  We get very good food, beds, etc., and I cannot sufficiently praise the building:  it is a very splendid building. (the Royal Pavilion).  Old pensioned officers (retired British officers from the British Indian Army) and their wives come to the hospital and enquire after our health, and give fruits and sweetmeats to the sick, and we also get fruit and sweetmeats from the state.  May God make our King victorious; it is proper for you to pray so, too.  ... England is a very fine country.  The King and Queen themselves came to visit the sick in hospital, and asked everyone if he had any sort of inconvenience.  Every soldier blessed them and said that they were well served in every way and prayed for their Majesties' long lives.' </em>[11]</p>
