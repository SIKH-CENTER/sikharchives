  <div class="piccaption1">Sir Walter Lawrence - Commissioner for the Welfare of Indian Troops, the man behind the message</div>
  <p>What had initially been an unplanned and potentially  politically dangerous undertaking in setting up the Indian hospitals in  Brighton, soon turned into a political windfall through the media bonanza that  the Royal Pavilion hospital was to become in marketing the &lsquo;benevolent Raj&rsquo;.  Initially Sir Walter Lawrence, like the Commander of the Indian Corps, General  Sir James Willcocks, believed that sending the Indian wounded for treatment in  Britain had been an error of political judgement. Lawrence later changed his  mind, and eventually concluded that &lsquo;<em>from  a political point of view, the decision to bring the Indians to English  hospitals had done more good than harm&rsquo;</em> [1]</p>
  <p>Although the Royal Pavilion had become a media spectacle  both in Britain as well as India, the image and messaging were carefully  controlled by the War Office and India Office to project the aura of British  Imperial benevolence and the ideas of imperial unity in the Empire.</p>
  <p>Because of the central role given to King George in  marketing the image of the Royal Pavilion hospital, almost all of the media  focus and attention was mainly focused on the Royal Pavilion Hospital (724  beds), with hardly any coverage of the other Indian hospitals in Brighton – the  much larger Kitchener Hospital (1,700 beds) or the York Place Hospital (550  beds). The media was used to perpetuate the myth of King George deciding to  turn over his palace into a hospital for his wounded Indian subjects and how  the King took an active part in ensuring the hospital met their needs and  visited them.</p>
  <p>Much of the British media focus and excitement was around  how the exotic &lsquo;Martial Races&rsquo; of the Orient who had come to the aid of the  Empire and were now being taken care of in the Brighton hospitals with the  utmost care. The Sikhs, described as a &lsquo;splendid race of fighting men&rsquo; and the  Gurkhas noted for their &lsquo;fearlessness in the fighting line&rsquo;. [2]</p>
  <p>Even though their movements were severely restricted, the  media image being created was that the soldiers were more like tourists at a  seaside resort while in Brighton – here were newspaper photographs of them on  the beach playing with local Brighton children, photographs of the Indian  soldiers strolling along the seaside boardwalk, photographs of the soldiers on  tourist outings by motorcar, photographs of them enjoying a tea party in the  town. All of these were carefully controlled media photo-opportunities for  domestic and overseas media consumption in India. For the most part they staged photo-opportunities had little  to do with the actual day-to-day activities and restrictive conditions placed  on the Indian patients or the atmosphere of mistrust that prevailed the British  hospital administration regarding their Indian patients.</p>
  <p>Throughout their presence in Brighton a continuous stream  of articles and propaganda appeared in the local media as the fascination with  the Indians and the Imperial benevolence being extended to them by the Empire  were central themes being repeated in each news item. Such news stories and the  fascination of the public with the Indians were so well received by readers  that an issue of the Brighton Herald that included pictures of the Royal  Pavilion as a hospital elicited unprecedented sales, with demands for reprints  continuing after the date of publication. [3] </p>
  <p>The dividends from this media strategy from far away  India can be seen in the case of the news reports about the cremation and  burial protocols being followed with Indian casualties at the Brighton  hospitals. These details received both national press and international  coverage. The Times remarked, &lsquo;<em>The  action of the civic authorities at Brighton in the matter is warmly appreciated  in India, the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, has written to the mayor thanking him&rsquo;</em>.  While the Maharaja of Bikanir in India wrote to The Times contrasting the  solicitude shown by the British Imperial authorities with what might have been  expected of the German authorities: &lsquo;<em>the  military authorities have spared no pains or outlay to ensure adequate  provision being made for the cremation or burial of soldiers in full accordance  with the ritual and customs of their respective communities&rsquo;.</em> [4]</p>
  <p class="indent1"> Grand Forks Sun (Canada) December 17, 1915<br>
    <em>A strange consequence of the war is that funeral pyres for Indian soldiers are being lighted on the Sussex Downs in the south of England. Major S. P. James, M.D., the head of the Kitchener hospital at Brighton, which accommodates more than 2,000 Indian patients, stated at the Royal Sanitary Institute congress that the bodies of the Hindu soldiers who die in the hospital are cremated on a specially prepared site at Patcham, on the Downs. The burning is done on a funeral pyre of wood logs, in precisely the same manner and with the same ceremonies as those performed in India. The cremation is conducted by a member of the same caste as that to which the dead man belonged. </em><br>
  </p>
  <p>Any negative issues such as the harsh prison-like  conditions that the patients experienced, especially at the Kitchener Hospital  were completely and successfully suppressed by Sir Walter Lawrence and the hospital  authorities to ensure that no news reports ever appeared in the local or overseas  media in India. A case in point being the incidents of suicide at the Indian  hospitals as well as the murder attempt on Colonel Seton, the commanding  officer of the Kitchener Hospital by an Indian sub-assistant surgeon unhappy  with the confinement of his comrades at the hospital. Both the incidents of suicides  as well at the shooting of Colonel Seton were personally communicated by Sir  Walter Lawrence to Lord Kitchener, but they were kept out of official reports  to the War Office. Such incidents that reflected the low morale of the Indian  patients were considered too dangerous and their exposure to the public  detrimental to the carefully cultivated media image of the Brighton hospitals  being propagated throughout the Empire. The comparatively light sentence of seven years &lsquo;rigorous  imprisonment&rsquo; given for the attempted murderer of Colonel Seton are indicative  of the authorities concern not to provoke any further  unrest in the Brighton hospitals or India and to keep this very serious  incident covered up and out of the media spotlight.
