  <div class="piccaption1">German Alliance: Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary,<br>
    Sultan Mehmed V of Turkey and Tzar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria</div>
  <p>While the British  presented an aura of imperial benevolence in running the Brighton hospitals,  under the surface their seems to have been an atmosphere of fear, mistrust and  paranoia as the British dealt with both real and imagined external and internal  threats.</p>
  <p>Rumours that the  British meant to kill off the Indian Expeditionary Force were circulating among  demoralized Indian troops in France, and the authorities were concerned that  these would have &lsquo;<em>a very serious  depressing effect in India and a very bad effect on recruiting</em>&rsquo;. Urgent  action was necessary if trust in the British authorities was to be  re-established and so a concerted effort was made to expand and improve  hospital accommodations. [1]</p>
  <p>The fact that Britain  had entered into war against Germany&rsquo;s ally the Turkish Ottoman Empire, the seat of the  Khilafat had angered some Muslims in India. There was a fear among the British  that the Muslims of India could rise up against them. The British were  particularly worried about  nationalist material such as the following German propaganda leaflet and the effect that it would have on their troops:</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p><img src="images\Propaganda1.gif" width="468" height="202" border="1"><br>
      <span class="piccaption1">German leaflet in Urdu written in the Devnagri script.</span><br>
      <em>'The High Priest of Islam in Holy Mecca has on the occasion of the Eid Festival issued an edict to you that declares jihad against the English and French. The King of Turkey has gone on war against the barbaric English, French and Russian nations and his allies are the Afghan people.'</em> [2]</p>
</div>
  <p>A letter written to a Muslim soldier fighting in Europe raises some of the same sentiments as the propaganda leaflet in extolling soldiers to rebel against the British:</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>An unnamed Muslim to  the Risaldar-Major of the 6th Cavalry, Troop No.1<br>
      (Urdu) Karachi, March 1916<br>
      <em>You are entangled in a war in which no  victory has been gained nor can any be gained in the future.  What you ought to do is raise your fellow  caste-men against the English and join the army of Islam (the Turks ). If you die in its service  it would be better than living as you are doing now.  Act as I have advised you, or you will be  sorry for if afterwards. God&rsquo;s orders have been received to the effect that the  destruction of the British Raj is at hand.  They are having to face great losses  everywhere. You ought to think over  this, for by sticking to the English you will gain neither this world nor the  next (heaven). All the Muslims who have  died in this war fighting for the British will spend an eternity in hell. Kill the English whenever you get a chance  and join the enemy. If you do not win in  this world you will at all events gain Paradise. You will certainly be safe from this King of  the traitors (George V).  Everything out  here is very clear and there is a regular famine. Be watchful, join the enemy, and you will  expel the Kafir (get rid of the unbelieving British) from your native land  (India).  The flag of Islam is ready and  will shortly be seen waving.  You Indians  make ready and we here in two days will rebel and imprison all the  English. Please God we shall do this,  for every caste (class of Indian) out here complains of them.</em> [3]</p>
  </div>
  <p>The majority of Muslim soldiers fighting in Europe did not share the same sentiments regarding the British and did not feel any close affinity towards the Turks:</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>A Muslim officer to  his brother (Central India)<br>
      France (Urdu), December 1914<br>
      <em>What better occasion can I find than this  to prove the loyalty of my family to the British Government? Turkey, it is  true, is a Muslim power, but what has it to do with us?  Turkey is nothing at all to us.  The men of France are beyond measure good and  honourable and kind.  By God, my brother,  they are gentlemen to the backbone!   Their manners and morals are in absolute accord with our ideas.  In war they are as one with us and with the  English.  Our noble King knows the  quality and the worth of his subjects and his Rajas alike. I give you the truth  of the matter. The flag of victory will be in the hands of our British  Government. Be not at all distressed. Without death there is no victory, but I  am alive and very well, and I tell you truly that I will return alive to India.</em> [4]</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>Sirfaraz Khan to  Dafadar Alam Khan (Baluchi Muslim, 18th Lancers, France)<br>
      <em>61st Camel Corps (Urdu) Lahore, April 161916  Punjab<br>
        Remember this, that you must always do the Sirkar&rsquo;s (British government) work  faithfully.  It is very difficult to get  such a King. The Turks are not our nephews and nieces!  I firmly rely on you, that you remain the  well-wisher of the Sirkar (British government) Still, it is proper that I  should advise you. The Turks made war against our Sirkar without any  cause.  Our Sirkar repeatedly told the  Turks before the war to remain neutral, and that their security would be  arranged for in every way. But the Turks would not be advised, and now they are  giving away their country with their own hands.</em> [5]</p>
  </div>
  <p>Another anti-British group, the  Ghadar Pary founded in 1913  by  Sikh immigrants to North America was also active both in North  America and India, mainly Punjab advocating a overthrow of the British Raj. At the advent of the war many Ghadrites had returned to India to fight for  independence. Letters from Indian soldiers, which passed through the hands of the official censor, reveal that Sikh Ghadrites had attempted to contact soldiers in France. [6]  </p>
  <p>The fear of  infiltrators and enemy propaganda led to a heightened sense of mistrust  directed towards both the Indian patients at the Brighton hospitals as well as  the Indian support staff that worked at the hospitals. </p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>Sir Walter Lawrence to  Lord Kitchener, March 1915<br>
      &lsquo;<em>The staff of the Hospitals, both in  Britain and France, have very black sheep in the matter of sedition. These are  very carefully watched. We have had to get rid of two in England, and there is  one man now under close observation in France&rsquo;</em>. [7]</p>
  </div>
  <p>Men of the Indian  support staff that worked at the Brighton hospitals had been recruited from  among bazaar coolies in Bombay and were unused to and resentful of military  discipline. They performed most of the domestic tasks at the hospitals and were  found to be the group most responsible for disciplinary offenses. There was a  real fear that the Brighton hospitals would become breeding grounds for  indiscipline and dissent as normally loyal troops would be subjected to  political propaganda or otherwise corrupted by the Indian hospital staff. [8] Surveillance  of the Indian staff and patients became a top priority. Sir Walter Lawrence  kept in close communications with the Chief Constable of Brighton to make sure  that the patients were closely watched while outside the hospital. [9]</p>
  <p>Keenly aware of how a minor incident of religious  perception had exploded into the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny and not wanting any minor  incident at the Brighton hospitals to become fuel for anti-Raj forces in India  it was decided to model the running of the Indian hospitals along the class and  caste separation found in a Hindu village in India. Wanting to ensure that the  Hindu majority in India was placated and satisfied with how their soldiers in  England were being treated, wards were segregated by race, and caste and  separate baths, kitchens, even toilet facilities and separate water plumbing  were installed. Catering to the  beliefs and taboos of the India's Hindu  majority was considered to be politically imperative. Sir Walter Lawrence was  certain that there were &lsquo;many outside&rsquo; waiting to seize and &lsquo;make political  capital&rsquo; out of any error made in regard to caste and religious procedure. [10]</p>
  <p>Fearing that any  incident of religious infringement might play into enemy propaganda, Sir Walter  Lawrence strictly forbid any kind of missionary work by Christian missionaries,  priests and organizations within the Indian hospitals.</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>Sir Walter Lawrence  to Lord Kitchener, 1915<br>
      <em>&lsquo;I have seen vernacular  translations of the gospels at the Pavilion, and I have orders that these  should be strictly excluded…Questions arise every day with clergymen and  missionaries who wish to be admitted to the hospitals… if it is abroad that any  attempt has been made to proselytise men who are sick or wounded, there would  be great trouble&rsquo;</em> [11] </p>
