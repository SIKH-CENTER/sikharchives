  <p>Unlike the Pavilion hospital, the Kitchener  Hospital was a  more restrictive environment for the Indian patients and  well as all of the Indian medical staff. Rrestrictions were placed on the  patients movements and activities were more strictly controlled.</p>
  <p>During 1915 there were a total of 377 offences  under military law committed in the Brighton hospitals. Most were relatively  minor in nature such as breaches of discipline, petty theft and alcohol related  disturbances and these were typically deal with fines. But 57 cases were deemed  sufficiently serious to warrant imprisonment. The most persistent offenders  were returned to India but from those that remained, Colonel Seton, the  commanding officer  was determined to  create a disciplined body of men. After subjecting them to 6 months of RAMC  military drills, Colonel Seton prided himself in having produced a capable body  of stretcher bearers and having reduced the incidence of petty crime to an  acceptable minimum. [1] </p>
  <p>All able bodied patients were required to  participate in drills and a one hour military march through the town every day.  Rur Singh of the 15th Sikhs, a patient at the Kitchener hospital,  told a friend in Marseilles that &lsquo;<em>we are in great discomfort. The sick in all  the hospitals are gathered together and paraded. The men cry and moan but no  one listens to them</em>&rsquo;. [2] In a letter dated August 5, 1915 from Sir Walter  Lawrence to Lord Kitchener, expressed the following belief: &lsquo;<em>The further the Sepoy gets from his regiment, the  more he longs for his native home. As soon as he is fit for light work he  should be drilled and given physical exercises, to get back the martial  spirit</em>.&rsquo; [3] Also PT drills were routine in the British Army, but in the British Indian Army, such drills during hospitalization were unprecedented as soldiers were used to recuperation without interference. These drills were viewed as a constraint on the soldiers liberty and a blow to their izzat or dignity. [4]</p>
  <p>In the spring of 1915 Colonel Seton imposed  a police cordon around the Kitchener to ensure that no Indian patients or staff  could visit the town. Barbed wire was added to the walls of the hospital and a  police guard placed along its perimeter [5] turning the Kitchener hospital  into a virtual prison for its patients. Patients and Indian staff were threatened  with flogging if they attempted to &lsquo;break out&rsquo;. The Indians were kept on a  tight leash because the authorities did not want them to mix with the women of  the town, for fear of what Colonel Seton called the &lsquo;gravest scandals&rsquo;. [6]  This belief in potential scandal that was viewed as detrimental to the prestige  and spirit of European rule in India also resulted in the ban of female nurses  at the Kitchener Indian Hospital. For further details on the rationale behind these policies see Analysis - <a href="..\analysis\raj.html">The British Raj and Imperial Benevolence</a>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<em>They  do not let us out to the bazaars. They do not let the French or English girls  talk to us, nor do they let us talk to them. The English have now become very  bad. They have become dogs. Our Indian soldiers are very much oppressed, but  they can do nothing…There is abundance of everything but there is no izzat  (honour)&rsquo; </em>wrote a Kitchener patient to his comrade in the 40th  Pathans. [7]</p>
  <p>The Indian patients experienced the attention  and affection from the women of Brighton. A British orderly in a letter dated  February 4, 1915 wrote, <em>&lsquo;Brighton is covered with girls who make a lot of the  natives ... they are seen to arm in arm with ward servants and are very fond  of coloured people</em>&rsquo;. [8] A Sikh patient writing home in a letter from August  28, 1915 wrote, <em>&lsquo;I am very happy in this place…There are lots of women to be  had. They write letters to us to come to their house and have food with them,  and that we can get a woman. I am very much confused in mind</em>&rsquo;. [9]</p>
  <p>The only ones allowed to visit the town were  senior Indian officers who were provided with passes with restricted hours and  accompanied by British officers. [10] For all other patients as well as Indian  staff, Brighton was strictly out of bounds.</p>
  <p>Although Colonel Seton was under the view  that things were under control regarding his strict policies at the Kitchener  hospital, things would quickly take a dramatic turn as the issue reached a  boiling point. An Indian sub-assistant surgeon transferred to the Kitchener  hospital from one of the Bournemouth Indian hospitals, in protest against the  confinement of his comrades in the Kitchener hospital compound walked into  Colonel Seton&rsquo;s office and shot at him with a revolver. Luckily the shot missed  and the man was sentenced to seven years &lsquo;rigorous imprisonment&rsquo;, a relatively  light sentence which may have reflected the authorities concern not to provoke  further unrest at the hospital, [11] or to have events and circumstances publicized in India.</p>
  <p>After the attempted shooting of Colonel  Seton the rules about mixing with British civilians were somewhat relaxed and  all Indian soldiers or staff were eligable to stroll about the town  in pairs for two and a half hours at a time accompanied by a British soldier.  [12]</p>
  <p>While patients at the Brighton hospitals  had initially been enthusiastic about their treatment such as the letter home  from Naik Sant Singh of the Garwhal Rifles, a patient at the Kitchener hospital  writing to a comrade, &lsquo;<em>I have been in  hospital for one month and 22 days…and the Government treated me so kindly that  not even my own father and mother could have done more&rsquo;</em>. [13] Over time  some became disillusioned with both their treatment as well as the war.</p>
  <p>A Kitchener hospital patient wrote, &lsquo;<em>Anyone whose hand is wounded or who has a  pain in his back {ie. Suspected of malingering} is branded with a hot iron. No  one is allowed outside… altogether the treatment is harsh.&rsquo;</em> [14]</p>

    <p>Buta Singh (Sikh) to Harnam Singh (23rd Pioneers, Aden)<br>
      Kitchener's Indian Hospital, Gurmukhi, August 5, 1915<br>
      <em>I have to tell you  that all of us who were suffering from piles have returned to India. If you are  still unwell, why do you not return? Your excuse is a good one. If you come any  further you will probably lose your life. We were 200 strong when we arrived.  Now there are forty of us. No! Make any excuse you can, and return home, so  that one of us can be saved. We know from letters that the wives of men still  alive have taken other husbands. People of the Punjab have lost all hope.</em> [15] </p>

  <p>With the low morale among Indian soldiers  fighting on the frontlines in France and in the Brighton hospitals expressed  through their letters the military authorities suspected that the cases of  self-inflicted wounds were more common among Indian soldiers. Colonel Seton  undertook a top-secret medical study based on 1,000 wounded Indian soldiers admitted to  the Kitchener hospital. Colonel Seton chose wounds for study which were most  likely to be self-inflicted: wounds to the hand, of the arm and forearm, and  wounds of the let and foot. Colonel Setons findings indicated that the  incidences of such wounds were by mere chance and statistics showed that the occurrences  of such wounds among the Indian soldiers were no higher than among soldiers of  other British regiments. [16]</p>
  <p>Given the low morale, there were also fears among the British that the soldiers in hospital might become easily suceptable to anti-British propoganda. Not only were patients watched carefully but the Indian support staff which were mainly civilians were regarded with suspicion as potential agitators as well. This created a environment of mistrust and suspicion at the Kitchener hospital. For further details see Analysis - <a href="..\analysis\enemy.html">Enemy Propaganda &amp; Sedition</a></p>
