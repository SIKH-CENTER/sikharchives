  <div class="piccaption1">Sikhs and Hindus share a separate slaughterhouse from the Muslims.<br>
    Brighton and Hove and South Sussex Graphic, July 29, 1915</div>
<p>Efforts were made to provide  the Indian patients with the  types of native foods and cooking that they were used to. Being able  to eat their own food rather than European foods was certainly much appreciated  by the patients. The British created three  groups of kitchens, one group for Muslims, one group for meat-eating Hindus and  Sikhs and one group for vegetarian Hindus and Sikhs. These three groups of  kitchens were further divided along caste and ethnic lines, resulting in nine  kitchens in total. [1] </p>
  <p>As the cow was considered sacred by the Hindus,  beef was not allowed in any form at the hospital, although other kinds of meats  such as goats and chickens were allowed for the Muslims and meat-eating Hindus  and Sikhs. Pork and bacon, popular among the British were also banned from the  hospital grounds to keep the Muslim patients happy. Separate butchers and  places for killing and storing meat were also provided [2] as Muslims ate  Halal meat, while meat-eating Sikhs were prohibited by their religion from  eating Halal and the Hindus required their own facilities to avoid  &lsquo;contamination&rsquo; of the meat. Muslim patients were also able to  observe their Ramadan fasting requirements at the hospital.</p>
  <p>Many of the Indians, especially the Hindus refused  to eat food that had been touched by British cooks, so special native cooks  where used for each religion and caste. [3] There was a caste head cook in charge of each kitchen, as  there were not enough caste cooks, patients fit enough from the various castes  were put into service in the kitchens cooking for their comrades. [4] </p>
  <p>As the new kitchens had European style counter  tops, the cooks had to be taught to stand up when cooking, as opposed to  squatting on the ground over a coal burning mud stove. The kitchens were  equipped with counters made of slabs of stone with gas rings for pots. For  roti&rsquo;s, sheets of iron were provided with parallel pipes with jets of gas  underneath. Cooking with gas provided a new experience for the native cooks, as  the flame could be instantly lighted and did not create a smoke filled room as their  traditional ovens did. [5]</p>
  <p>Due to the large amount of milk that Indians  traditionally use, a dedicated dairy  was established for the soldiers use  inside the Pavilion complex. Again keeping with their Hindu related caste  taboo&rsquo;s, milk was wheeled from the hospital dairy to the wards in special cans,  each painted with the name of a different caste. These specially marked milk  cans could only be handed out by milk attendants of the same caste as their  patients drinking the milk. [6]</p>
  <p>Dhal (lentils) and ghee (clarified butter made only  from milk with no animal fat) and Indian spices were the only food imported,  all other foods and ingredients were sourced locally in the surrounding  communities. It took some experimentation to find the right kind of local  English flour to use for making roti&rsquo;s and this was approved by the British bureaucracy  of a special committee of Indian Officers representing all the various castes.
