  <p>Lt. Colonel J.N. MacLeod of the Indian Medical  Service who already had experience fitting out hospital ships for Indian  soldiers was immediately recalled from France and appointed the Commanding  Officer of the Royal Pavilion hospitals. Colonel MacLeod had also been the late  Civil Surgeon of Quetta, Baluchistan prior to his retirement. Under Colonel MacLeod,  the Royal Pavilion and York Place Hospitals were run by the Senior Medical  Officer, Colonel Sir R. Neil Campbell, who had been the late Inspector General  Civil Hospitals, Assam prior to his retirement. [1]</p>
  <p>Under Colonel Sir R. Neil Campbell the Pavilion  hospital complex was divided into eight administrative sections with each  section headed by a senior officer of the Indian Medical Service. All of these  officers were retired officers who had previously served in India and the  surrounding region. Although they understood Indian patients and could  communicate with them in native dialects, many of them were unfortunately out  of date with the latest medical practices and some were considered by the  patients to be more patronizing and stricter than their England based British  officers.</p>
  <p>As England had always traditionally been a  destination for a small minority of well-to-do Indians to send their sons  overseas for education, there were a number of Indian students already in  England at the outbreak of the war. A number of Indian doctors and medical  students volunteered to help the British war effort and were granted temporary  commissions in the Indian Medical Service and assigned to the Brighton  hospitals. [2] A staff of these medical students worked as dressers and ward  orderlies under the supervision of British doctors at the Pavilion hospital. </p>
  <p>Other Indian students who did not have a medical  background were organized under Lt. Colonel R.J. Barker as the Indian Volunteer  Ambulance Corps [3] and served in transporting the wounded to the Brighton  hospitals as well as providing service as interpreters when needed.</p>
  <p>One of the more interesting aspects of staffing at  the Brighton hospitals was the issue of white female nurses. The British felt  that having European female nurses taking care of Indian patients would lead  for a diminishing of izzat, or respect for the British Raj and &lsquo;white&rsquo; women by  the Indian natives. [4] Although the Queen Alexandra&rsquo;s Imperial Nursing  Service had been expected to provide nursing staff, Indian Viceroy, Lord  Hardinge made it clear that white women were never employed at any hospital for  Indian soldiers in India and he expected the same practice to be followed in  the Indian hospitals in Brighton. This was also the view of General Sir James  Willcocks, the Commander of the Indian Corps in France. </p>
  <p>During the initial setup of the Brighton hospitals  and their operation in late 1914 up to June 1915 some women nurses were  employed at the Pavilion and York Place hospitals, but only in a supervisory and  administrative role, it was made clear that they were not to provide any actual  nursing to the Indian patients. [5] In May 1915 following the publication of a  photo in the Daily Mail of a white nurse having herself photographed standing  beside the hospital bed of wounded Victoria Cross winner Mir Dast [6] the War  Office issued a directive and all female nurses of the Queen Alexandra&rsquo;s  Imperial Military Nursing Service were finally withdrawn in June 1915 and  replaced by male orderlies.</p>
