  <p>Although the Royal Pavilion palace may appear as a  lovely palace at a seaside resort town were the Indians could experience  British culture and hospitality of the local residents of Brighton, the reality  was that they were fairly isolated from the general population. Part of  ensuring that the Indians maintained their respect for the &lsquo;white man&rsquo; and  their British masters was to ensure that patients were restricted to the palace  grounds and that the movement of any patients outside of those grounds was  limited, controlled and supervised by British military officers and guards. [1]</p>
  <p>The patients enjoyed the large gardens of the  palace and photographs of them playing cards and various other games as well as  enjoying the sun and fresh-air can be found. Other photographs of soldiers  outside of the Pavilion grounds were largely staged for propaganda purposes  both in Britain to show the general population the help and care being extended  to their colonial Indian subjects while patients in England as well as showing  the native populations in India of the quality care being provided to their  wounded Indian relatives by the benevolent King George who they were fighting  and dying for. For further details see Analysis - <a href="..\analysis\media.html">Media Messaging</a></p>
  <p>Policies concerning outings and discipline seem to  have varied between the hospitals. While conditions seem to have been less  harsh at the Pavilion Hospital compared to the Kitchener Hospital where a more restrictive environment  resulted in a number of morale issues (see the Kitchener Hospital - <a href="..\kitchener\morale.html">Morale and Discipline</a>).  A number of controlled outings for the hospital patients in the city of  Brighton were offered. Small groups of patients, not exceeding five were  allowed short walks along the sea front accompanied by a British officer. [2]</p>
  <p>One of the most popular and well liked British  officers was Lt. Col. George Henry Brook Coats, C.B. who was appointed the President  of the Recreation Committee. [3] He had previously been the late Commandant of  the 25th Punjab Infantry prior to his retirement in 1910. Colonel Coats  would take out men for routine marches, sightseeing walking tours of Brighton  and even trips to the theatre. For those wounded patients unable to walk but  not confined to their bed, car trips to take benefit of the Brighton sea air  were also organized. [4]</p>
  <p>Sir Austen Chamberlain, the Secretary of State for  India suggested and enacted a system where Indian patients from the Brighton  hospitals were taken in small escorted guided tours of London once a week where  they were met by a British officer fluent in various Indian languages who acted  as their guide. [5]</p>

    <p>Wanganui Chronicle (New Zealand), August 18,1915<br>
      <em>The Pavilion at Brighton - that architectural freak of the Georges - is filled with wounded men. Driving along country roads one meets often char-a-bancs (motor coaches) filled with men in the bright blue hospital suits, who are having an outing and thoroughly enjoying it. One waves to them and greets them as a matter of course, and if the girl is pretty it is quite likely an invalid may call . something very choice indeed.</em></p>
  </div>
  <p>A number of Indian volunteers who had been students  in England also acted as letter writers and readers for the patients, many of  who were illiterate. Colonel Graves, who had been the Commandant of the 40th  Pathans prior to his retirement, would attend the hospital daily to help  patients with their letters. [6] He may have been the inspiration for the  doctor in <a href="..\..\arts\kipling\index.html">Rudyard Kiplings short story</a> about a Indian patient at the Royal  Pavilion hospital dictating a letter home.</p>
  <p>Due to the large amount of attention that the  Indian soldiers were attracting in England through British propaganda efforts,  a Gift House was set up on the Pavilion grounds. Here under the charge of a  committee of volunteer ladies gifts for the Indian soldiers sent by the general  public from all across the country were collected, sorted and distributed  evenly to the Indian patients. [7]</p>
  <p>In terms of practicing their religions, separate  parts of the Pavilion grounds were reserved for prayers by Muslims and Hindus  and the Sikhs were allowed to erect a large tent on the grounds where Sri Guru  Granth Sahib was installed and which they ran as their hospital Gurdwara. [8]</p>

      Pavilion Hospital							(Urdu) Brighton								August 4, 1915<br>
      <em>The arrangements here to enable our people to keep Ramadan are excellent.  Colonel Southey Sahib - perhaps you know him - has made excellent arrangements and takes great trouble for us Muslims.  His arrangements for our food during the fast are very good, and he has put us all together in one place, because during the fast it is not easy to live with Sikhs and Dogras.  I cannot describe how good his arrangements are.  I have heard from the regiment.  They are still behind; resting, but I do not know how long it will last.  I saw the Adjutant, Griffin Sahib, here.  His wound has healed and he said he had been passed as fit by the doctors and was going back to the regiment.  He had a bullet wound in his foot. </em>[9]</p>
