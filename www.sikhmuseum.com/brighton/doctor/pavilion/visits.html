<p>The Royal Pavilion Hospital experienced a number of  prominent and high-profile visitors. The visits were not only important for satisfying the curious public but were also very important propaganda vehicles in the fight to counter anti-British propaganda both in India and being promoted by the Germans and their allies and directed towards the fighting Indian soldiers in France. Such visits were crucial propaganda missions in helping to maintain the British Indian Empire.</p>
  <p>The most prominent visitor to the Brighton hospitals  was King George V and Queen Mary who first visited the Pavilion on January 9th,  1915 and then again on August 25, 1915. [1] Few of the Indian soldiers ever  imagined that they would ever see the King in person in their lifetime. </p>
  <p>To many of the Indian soldiers there was a personal  connection and direct loyalty to the King as a father figure. The following  letter from a wounded Sikh soldier illustrates this relationship.</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>A wounded Sikh to his brother (Amritsar District,  Punjab)<br>
      [Gurmukhi], England, 15th January 1915<br>
      <em>Brother, I fell  ill with pneumonia and have come away from the war. In this country it rains a  great deal: always day and night it rains. So pneumonia is very rife. Now I am  quite well and there is no occasion for any kind of anxiety ... If any of us is  wounded, or is otherwise ill, Government or someone else always treats him very  kindly. Our Government takes great care of us, and we too will be loyal and  fight. You must give the Government all the help it requires. Now look, you my  brother, our father the King-Emperor of India needs us and any of us who  refuses to help him in his need should be counted among the most polluted  sinners. It is our first duty to show our loyal gratitude to Government.</em> [2]</p>

  <p>For further details on the importance of the King see Analysis - <a href="..\analysis\king.html">Role and Image of King George</a></p>
  <p>The August 25th visit of the King and  Queen accompanied by Princess Mary was an elaborate propaganda and media affair, duly photographed and filmed,  the King had come   to personally decorate ten of the wounded Indian officers and  one Indian non-commissioned officer. Over a thousand of the Indian patients  gathered on the western lawn of the Pavilion for the investiture  ceremony. [3] Here on the western lawn  on a stage surrounded by his personal staff and the staff of the Hospital  behind him and surrounded in a large semi-circle of patients wearing their pale  blue hospital uniforms, the recipients were honoured one-by-one bought forward  by Colonel MacLeod the Commanding Officer of the Royal Pavilion Hospital and  presented to the King by Colonel Sir Walter Lawrence. </p>
  <p>After the official ceremony the King and Queen  toured the hospital wards to speak to the patients who were not well enough to  attend the ceremony on the lawns as well as toured the kitchens and facilities  of the hospital. It is interesting to note that the King spoke to the patients  in Hindustani rather than English. [4] Following a time-honoured Indian  tradition of presenting personal petitions to the Emperor, the King also listed  to a number of personal petitions presented to him by Indian patients.</p>
  <p>The highlight of the royal visit for the Sikh  patients occurred in the evening while they were performing their evening  prayers and kirtan (the singing of religious hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib).  Upon hearing the Sikh kirtan the King made his way to the Gurdwara that the  Sikhs had set up in a tent on the lawn. [5] The Sikhs were so overjoyed at  the King attending their Gurdwara that they offered a special petition for the  victory of King George in their prayers. [6]</p>
  <p>On June 25, 1915 Queen Alexandra, wife of King  Edward VII and mother of King George V accompanied by the aged veteran General  Sir Dighton Probyn visited the Royal Pavilion Hospital. [7] Probyn was well respected by the Indian soldiers  having been a captain in the 2nd Punjab Cavalry, Bengal Army during the 1858 Indian  Mutiny where he won the Victoria Cross. [8] The Queen subsequently sent a colored  photograph of herself and King Edward to every patient in the hospital. [9] The  gifting of such portraits was a common practice and the value that many of the soldiers placed on these photographs were indicative to the personal relationship in fighting the war for the British royal family that many Indians felt.</p>

    <p>Jemadar Khisan Singh (Sikh) to his wife (Nabha State,  Punjab)<br>
      36th Jacob's Horse, [Gurmukhi], February 6,1917<br>
      <em>I have sent you  thrice before pictures of His Majesty. As you framed those and put them up on  the wall opposite the door, so do the same with this portrait after framing it.  Worship it every morning when you get up. This is an act of religious merit,  and the portrait will be a memorial. Every morning, pray to the Guru that He  will give victory to the King. Do not be anxious about me. I am quite happy.</em> [10]</p>

  <p>Other royal visitors to the Brighton hospitals  included Princess Maud, young sister of King George V, H.R.H. Princess Henry of  Battenberg who visited the hospital twice, H.R.H. Princess Louise, King Manoel  of Portugal and Lady Minto, wife of the Viceroy Lord Minto. [11]</p>
  <p>Next to King George V the most prominent visitor to  the Pavilion hospital was the Secretary of State for War, Field Marshall Lord  Kitchener who was in charge of the British Empires war efforts in WWI. The  Kitchener Indian Hospital in Brighton was named in his honour. Having  previously served as Commander-in-Chief, India from 1902 to 1909, he was well  known to the Indian soldiers and affectionately called &lsquo;Jung-iLat Sahib&rsquo;,  meaning War Lord. Every able bodies Indian solder at the hospital gathered on  the Pavilion grounds for an enthusiastic reception for Lord Kitchener  accompanied by Colonel Sir Walter Lawrence and Colonel Fitzgerald, Personal  Military Secretary. Lord Kitchener toured the hospital wards and then on the  grounds the Indian officers were individually presented to him and he shook  hands with each. Lord Kitchener then addressed the officers and congratulated  them and all the Indian soldiers on their gallant services to the Empire. [12]</p>
  <p>The Pavilion hospital not only had to cater to scheduled  visits, but also received unscheduled surprise visits as well. On March 29,  1915, The Secretary of State of India, Lord Crewe made a surprise inspection  visit to the Brighton hospitals visiting the Royal Pavilion, Kitchener Hospital  and York Place Hospital and expressed his satisfaction at the level of care  being offered the Indian soldiers. [13] Lord Crew&rsquo;s successor as Secretary of  State for India, Sir Joseph Austen Chamberlain visited the Pavilion hospital on  July 3 to July 4, 1915. Sir Chamberlain was greatly interested in seeing the  Muslims at prayers and visiting the Sikh Gurdwara that had been set up in a  tent on the Pavilion grounds. He told the Sikhs that it gave him much  satisfaction to have a Sikh as a member of his own Council and that he had  arranged for them to have a copy of the Indian newspaper Akhbar-i-Jang printed  in London translated into Gurmukhi for them.
