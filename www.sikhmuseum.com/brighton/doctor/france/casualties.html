  <p>At the start of World War I in the late autumn of  1914, one in every three soldiers under British command in France was from  India. [1]  During the war 14,514 Indian  soldiers and officers wounded in France would be brought to England for  treatment. [2]</p>
<p>The British military was ill prepared to deal with  the casualties as Sikh, Hindu and Muslim soldiers died and were wounded on the  battlefields of France.</p>

  <p>Isar Singh (Sikh,  59th Rifles) letter to a friend (50th Punjabis, India)<br>
    Indian General  Hospital  [Gurmukhi], Brighton, 1st May  1915<br>
    <em>The battle is being carried on very bitterly. In the Lahore Division only 300 men are left. Some  are dead, some wounded. The division is finished. Think of it — in taking fifty  yards of a German trench 50,000 men are killed. When we attack they direct a  terrific fire on us — thousands of men die daily. It looks as if not a single  man can remain alive on either side — then (when none is left) there will be  peace. When the Germans attack they are killed in the same way. For us men it  is a bad state of affairs here. Only those return from the battlefield who are  slightly wounded. No one else is carried off. Even Sahibs are not lifted away.  The battleground resounds with cries. </em>[3]</p>

  
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Santa Singh (Sikh)  letter to his uncle (India)<br>
    A hospital [Gurmukhi],  Brighton, 18th August 1915<br>
    <em>As tired bullocks and bull buffaloes lie down in the month of Bhadon  (Aug-Sept) so lies the weary world. Our hearts are breaking, for a year has  passed while we have stood to arms without a rest ... Germany fights  the world with ghastly might, harder to crush than well-soaked grain in the  mill. For even wetted grain can be ground in time ... We have bound ourselves  under the flag and we must give our bodies.</em> [4]</p></div>

<p>Not only was the fighting in the battlefield  fierce, but the troops had been rushed to Europe,  ill equipped for the cold weather. The heavy rains of autumn 1914 were followed  by severe frost and snow but most of the Indian troops did not have winter  clothing or proper footwear. Respiratory illnesses frostbite and &lsquo;trench foot&rsquo; would  become additional challenges on the battlefield. In fact soldiers considered  frostbite even more deadly than &lsquo;bullet bite&rsquo;, especially if gangrene set in.  [5]</p>
<div class="indent1">
  <p>Wounded Sepoy in Brighton Hospital to a relative in  Kumaon,<br>
    Letter no. 3, 16 January 1915, Censor of Indian  Mails (CIM)<br>
    <em>In this sinful  country, it rains very much and also snows, and many men have been  frost-bitten… All the men will be finished here. In the space of a few months  how many have fallen and how many have been wounded.</em> [6]</p>
</div>
  <p>Initially the plan at the start of the war had been  to evacuate the sick and wounded via Marseilles to Egypt and then to India, but  this was soon found to be impractical given the high number of casualties. [7] By  November 11, 1914 there were more than 1,000 wounded Indian soldiers at  Brockenhurst in Hampshire [8] where the Balmer Lawn Hotel and the Forest Park Hotel  [9] were renamed the Lady Hardinge Hospital and offered a total of 640 beds, it  proved so overcrowded that wounded soldiers were accommodated on mattresses on  the floor. [10] While waiting for these facilities some of the wounded Indians  were sent to a section of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Netley, while three  ships in Southampton harbor, the Sicilia, Glengorm Castle and Goorkha became  stationary hospital ships. [11]</p>
  <p>The Mount Dore Hotel in Bouremouth was taken over  and renamed the Mont Dore 8A Indian Hospital and a convalescent home was set up  at New Milton, Barton-on-Sea. [12]</p>
  <p>Sepoy Ranga Singh, a patient at the Lady Hardinge  Hospital, Brockenhurst, complained that: &lsquo;<em>There  is no fireplace. We are not given milk…It is very cold. We have to call the  nurses &ldquo;mother&rdquo; and the European soldiers &ldquo;Orderly Sahib&rdquo; - if we do not we are  reported. The five Brighton hospitals are good. The others are not good. We are  not given soup. We get nothing.&rsquo; [13]</em></p>
  <p>These efforts provided some temporary relief, but  overcrowded, unhygienic and woefully inadequate given the rate of casualties at  the front; larger accommodations and proper hospital facilities for the wounded  Indian soldiers had to be found quickly.  </p>
