        Pavilion Hospital. Brighton Society 1914', Dec. 3, 1914</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If a soldier was injured in the no-mans land  between the British and the Germans, he would likely have to wait until  nightfall before being brought in for medical attention as rescue under fire in  the daytime was very difficult.</p>
  <p>The Regimental Medical Officers in the trenches  after initially treating the wounded soldiers would have them sent to the  Regimental Aid Posts at the rear. Here casualties would be sorted out and field  ambulances which were mostly horse driven carts with some motor driven  ambulances would take the wounded to an Advanced Dressing Station which were  typically two to three miles away. [1]</p>
  <p>From the Advanced Dressing Stations the wounded  soldiers would be taken to one of six hospital trains which were fully equipped  hospitals on wheels with facilities for operations and treatment. These medical  trains could typically carry up to 400 patients and would make the journey to the  French coastal ports of Boulogne or Le Havre which was 200  miles further. [2] This train  could take up to three days and some of  the more seriously wounded died during this journey.</p>
  <p>From the coastal ports at Boulogne  and Le Havre the Indian soldiers were  transferred to specially equipped hospital ships for the journey across the  English Channel to England.</p>
  <p>Once in England  the wounded soldiers would be taken by train to Brighton.  During the war 233 London, Brighton and South Coast Railway ambulance trains  would carry over 30,070 wounded soldiers to Brighton. [3]</p>
  <p>Once the hospitals in Brighton were ready to  receive the wounded Indian soldiers, many of them that had been wounded earlier  and had been taken to Southampton and the nearby Netley hospital were also now transferred  to Brighton. [4]</p>
  <p>A number of motor ambulances were set up under the  command of Major Brailey to take the wounded Indian soldiers from the Brighton train station where they would arrive to their  hospital beds at the Royal Pavilion, Kitchener or the York Place hospitals in town. On several  occasions as many as 200 wounded Indian soldiers would be in their beds in  little over an hour after their arrival at the Brighton Railway Station. [5]</p>
  <p>The very first small contingent on wounded Indian  soldiers arrived on Saturday December 5, 1914 [6] and were taken to the Royal  Pavilion where they were placed in the hospital wards set up in the Music Room  and the North Drawing Room.</p>
  <p>The first large contingent of Indian soldiers would  arrive nine days later on Monday December 14, 1914. [7] There was much  excitement in Brighton and a large crowd gathered to cheer the arriving Indian  soldiers including the Mayor and other town officials. There were two trains,  the first with 112 patients (100 of which were serious stretcher cases unable  to walk) and 233 Indian soldiers in the second train. Of this first large  contingent of Indian soldiers, 200 were taken to the Royal Pavilion hospital  and 145 were sent to the York    Place hospital. [8]</p>
  <p>Even though it was a cold and rainy day, the crowds  nevertheless cheered the arriving heroes from the Front.</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p>Brighton Gazette December 16, 1914<br>
      <em>&lsquo;At last the wounded Indians are duly installed at Brighton.  They arrived under rather mournful conditions. A drab day, rainstorms, and a  fierce sea running in the Channel, mud-laden streets, and a vista of dripping  umbrellas and mackintoshes. That was the first impression the warriors got of Brighton, and it was rather chilling. But crowds  assembled to voice public welcome, and the reception undoubtedly cheered the  brave fellows. The hundred stretcher cases in the first train that reached the  terminus on Monday afternoon constituted perhaps the most distressing of the  many pathetic sights seen on similar occasions during the past four months.  Something akin to a feeling of awe was created by the silence with which the  work of bringing them out of the train and placing them in the motor ambulances  was carried on.</em></p>
