  <p>On the southern coast of England, Brighton appeared  to be a natural choice in terms of geographical proximity to the battlefields  of France for setting up proper hospital facilities for Indian soldiers in  England. So close that in June 1916 the sound of guns firing at the Battle of  Somme could be heard on the cricket field at Brighton College. [1]</p>
  <p>Lord Kitchener the Secretary of State for War  appointed Sir Walter Lawrence as his Commissioner in charge of the Welfare of  Indian Troops to quickly find arrangements for the ever growing number of  Indian wounded soldiers. [2]</p>
  <p>Sir Walter Lawrence accompanied by Major P.S.  Lelean of the Royal Army Medical Corps who had experience in India visited  Brighton on Saturday November 21, 1914. [3] The Mayor of Brighton Alderman  Otter and the Corporation of Brighton agreed to make three facilities available  to the Army to be converted into hospitals. These would include the York Place   School, the Royal  Pavilion Complex and the Brighton Workhouse. Returning to London that same day, Sir Walter Lawrence  telegraphed His Majesty that the Royal Pavilion complex had been secured as an  Indian hospital. The King was very pleased with the news. [4]</p>
  <p>For further details on  some of the politics behind the decision to choose the Royal Pavilion see Analysis - <a href="..\analysis\selection.html">Selection of the Royal Pavilion</a></p>
  <p>The work of converting the buildings was led by Major  Lelean.</p>
  <p>The York   Place School  in Brighton was rapidly converted into a 550 bed military hospital. Classrooms were filled  with beds and the gymnasium transformed into a 60 bed ward. [5]</p>
  <p>The Royal Pavilion Complex and the Brighton  Workhouse would next be converted into large facility hospitals in a rapid  time frame due to the urgency of finding space for Indian wounded soldiers. Work  progressed immediately on the conversions with many challenges to overcome. In  fact the first small contingent of wounded Indian soldiers would arrive in  Brighton a mere 13 days later in mid December 1914. [6]</p>

    <div class="piccaption1">Troops from the local Sussex Yeomanry help setup<br>
      hospital bed frames for the conversion of the Royal Pavilion. </div>
  </div>
<p>From a crowded museum and public space, the Royal Pavilion, the Dome  and the Corn Exchange buildings were now transferred into hospital wards.</p>
  <p>In the Royal Pavilion, the Banqueting Room, the  Music Room, the South Drawing Room and the Saloon were all converted to  hospital wards. The rooms upstairs were converted to semi-private hospital  rooms for ranking Indian officers. [7] There was no running water in the palace,  so hot and cold water plumbing had to be laid out in every ward, theatre and  bath and sanitary arrangements made by linking up the sanitation system with  that of the town. [8]</p>
  <p>Ventilation in the Royal Pavilion and the Dome was  found to be woefully inadequate and radical improvements were made to the  structures to improve the flow of air in the buildings. Two operating theatres,  one in the Dome and another in the Royal Pavilion were set up. [9]</p>
  <p>The Dome, a theater had 1,500  seats clamped to it&rsquo;s tiers that had to be removed and the entire floor was covered  with khaki coloured linoleum. A detachment of troops from the nearby Sussex  Yeomanry were used to assemble and set up all of the hospital beds. [10]</p>
  <p>Major Lelean now having completed the initial set  up of the various wards with hospital beds by the end of November 1914 sent a set of photographs to the War Office, &lsquo;showing  the Dome as a completed Hospital with radial beds around a center embedded in  tropical foliage&rsquo;. The photographs were delivered to Lord Kitchener who took  them straight to King George. Both considered the arrangements made as  excellent. [11] </p>
  <p>In total the Royal Pavilion, Dome and Corn Exchange housed a total of 724 beds. [12]</p>
  <p class="subtitle1">Brighton Workhouse  Becomes the Kitchener Hospital</p>
<p>Workhouses were a type of social welfare housing prevalent  in 19th and early 20th century England. Here the poor, seniors,  orphans, unmarried mothers and those with physical or mental challenges would  live and work. In order to deter able-bodied paupers seeking to take advantage  of community charity, conditions in workhouses were intentionally harsh.  Families would be separated as married men and women were forced to live separately  and their children taken away from them with limited contact and raised by the  institution. Although inmates were free to leave at will, those who stayed  because they had no other option faced a life of often menial work, monotonous  food and communal dormitories. The Brighton Workhouse was completed in 1867 and  initially housed 861 inmates. [13]</p>
  <p>The Brighton Workhouse was chosen as a candidate  for conversion into what would be the largest Indian Soldiers hospital in England.</p>
  <p>The Workhouses existing 1,050 inmates were  evacuated to large homes in Brighton and Hove  and other facilities, much to the inconvenience of their new hosts who were  less than thrilled to have the sick and infirm inmates as guests. [14]</p>
  <p>After extensive conversion the workhouse was  converted into a 1,700 bed hospital with the capacity to accommodate 1,000 more  patients in tents or huts on the adjacent racecourse if necessary. The  Workhouse was now renamed the Kitchener General Indian Hospital in honor of  Lord Kitchener who had previously been commander of the Army in India from 1902  to 1911 prior to his current appointment as Secretary of State for War in 1914.  [15]</p>
  <p>Indian Army veteran Brevet-Colonel Sir Bruce Seton,  Bt. who had previously been the Honorary Surgeon to the Viceroy and Deputy  Director-General of the Indian Medical Service was appointed the Commanding  Officer of the new Kitchener hospital. [16]</p>
