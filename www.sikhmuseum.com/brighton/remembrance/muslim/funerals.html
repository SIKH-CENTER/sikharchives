  <p>The British Command felt the need to provide  Muslim cemeteries in order to counter German propaganda that Muslim troops were  not being accorded the correct burial, and to promote the cause of the German  alliance with the Muslim Ottoman Turkish Empire. The opening of the burial  ground was used as counter- propaganda by the Viceroy of India and the India  Office to great effect. [1] The Viceroy let it be known throughout India that  the Imam from the Woking Mosque would conduct proper burials of any killed  Muslim soldiers according to full Islamic funeral rites. [2] Furthermore the souvenir  book about the Brighton hospital distributed by the India Office throughout  India mentioned that when a Muslim soldier died at Brighton they  were taken to Woking accompanied by a Muslim party including a Muslim doctor.  Once at the Mosque the burial would be conducted with full Muslim rights by the  Imam and that a full military funeral including a firing party would be  provided. [3]</p>

    <p>Saddler Ibrahim to Babu Rukan-ad-din, Sialkot, Punjab, 15th Cavalry (Urdu) Brighton							January 10 1916<br>
      <em>On the 16th December a Syce (Abdullah, rank Syce, 32nd Signal Coy) belonging to our section died, and the Government made arrangements for his burial.  A fine coffin was provided on which his name and age were engraved.  The inside was lined with silk cloth and cushions of silk.  In our country doubtless only the greatest in the land are furnished with coffins of this sort.  He was buried in a Muslim cemetery (in Woking) near London with great honour and dignity.  The exalted Government has showered every blessing on us here, which I shall remember all my life, and which will bind me in complete loyalty.  Yesterday some Royal princesses came from London to see us.  They spoke to each one and treated us kindly as if we had been their children.</em> [4] </p>

    <p>D.R.Thaper<br>
      Assistant quarter Master of the Muslim priest at Woking Mosque, Royal Pavilion Hospital<br>
      <em>Muslims had to be taken by road to the Mosque at Woking... the funeral cortege comprised a motor hearse (carrying the coffin), a car and a couple of lorries to carry 40 or 50 mourners.  It was fortunate that we had very few deaths as each one meant a whole day's travelling to London and back.  The Iman Sahib, insisted on every detail to be carried out and soon I became proficient as an undertaker.  On the first occasion it seemed strange that the chief mourner should be a non muslim, but the Iman was very kind and considerate and soon initiated me into the procedure.</em> [5]</p>
  </div>
  <p>The Imam of the Woking Mosque, Maulvi Sadr-ud-Din felt that the burials and the cemetery itself were not up to standard and he   wrote the following letter of concern to the authorities on August, 1915:</p>
  <div class="indent1">
    <p><em>I have already buried three in the new burial-place  but, though it is fenced in, it is in such a disgraceful state that it would  not be policy to allow the Indian soldiers to go and see the burial-place of  their comrades. They have frequently asked, but I have had to put them off  because - being a loyal subject of His Majesty - I did not desire to raise the  resentment which must inevitably be felt when the truth becomes known of the manner  in which the British Government have treated their dead heroes.</em></p>
    <p><em>I have had bodies sent to me bearing the wrong names;  bodies sent without any flowers; bodies sent to me at any hour of the day or  night without any previous notice, and no respect shown for them whatever - not  even any military demonstration at their graves.</em></p>
    <p><em>No caretaker is provided for the Cemetery. If a  visitor desires to go there, I myself - the head of the Mahommedan Church in  England - am compelled to go with the key and admit the stranger, and already  the cheap wooden doors, doors are so warped that it is difficult to open them.</em></p>
    <p><em>I desire to point out to the Government the very grave  danger of allowing the impression to gain ground in India that England is not  showing sufficient respect to the memories of her Indian heroes,</em></p>
    <p><em>I need not enlarge upon the very serious effect which  an exposure of this kind would make, both among the soldiers at the front, and  the entire population throughout India.</em>  [6]</p>
