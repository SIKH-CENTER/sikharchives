    Raja Daljit Singh of  Kapurthala can be credited as the person who initially thought of the idea of  erecting the Indian Memorial Gateway in the town of Brighton to thank its  inhabitants for their wartime help to the Indian wounded soldiers. </p>
  <p>In his speech at the  opening of the Indian Memorial Gateway, the Maharaja of Patiala, Bhupinder  Singh recognized Raja Daljit Singh for his inspiration:</p>
  <p class="box_indent1"><em>&quot;I am happy to think that  the idea of some visible and lasting token of our appreciation and gratitude  was first, suggested by a member of the Sikh race, Raja Daljit Singh, who was  then well placed for promoting the project, being a member of the Council of  India in Whitehall.&rdquo; [1]</em></p>
  <p>Hon. Raja Sir Daljit  Singh (1882 - 1946) was a member of the Kapurthala royal family. He was the  grandson of Raja Nihal Singh who ruled the Sikh Kingdom of Kapurthala from 1836  to 1852. Educated at Aitchison College in Lahore he was a member of the  Imperial Legislative Council at Calcutta from 1913-1915, member of the Council  of State from 1915 to 1917, Member of the Third Council of the Lieutenant  Governor of the Punjab from 1913 to 1916 and Chief Minister of Jammu and  Kashmir State from 1917 to 1921.</p>
  <p>Not only did Raja  Daljit Singh come up with the idea of the Indian Memorial Gateway, but he was  also instrumental in raising funds for the construction of the memorial by soliciting  donations from the Maharajas of various Indian Kingdoms.</p>
  <p>A 1916 letter from  Raja Daljit Singh to the Maharaja of Gondal provides important insight into  the initial inspiration and early work done in making the idea of the Indian  Memorial Gateway into a reality.</p>

  <p><em>Dear Thakor Sahib,</em></p>
  <p><em>When the Indian  wounded came to England the town of Brighton behaved most generously and gave  their splendid buildings for hospitals, The people did all they could to make  the Indian feel happy and &quot;at home&quot;. The Mayor and Corporation as a  further mark of sympathy are now going to put a memorial on the spot where the  bodies of Hindu soldiers were cremated. The Mahommadan soldiers who there died  were buried at Woking where the War Office are erecting a memorial.</em></p>
  <p><em>Sir Walter Lawrence  and I went to Brighton the other day and were taken by the Mayor to the  Crematorium which is some way outside the town.</em></p>
  <p><em>It struck me that it  would be a good thing if we were to put up an Indian memorial in Brighton itself  to mark the fact of Indians - Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs - coming to this  country to fight for their King and Empire, and also to show a grateful regard  for the hospitality of the people of Brighton. I propose Brighton, for it is  the place where wounded Indian soldiers first came to England and received so  enthusiastic a welcome. Besides in Brighton such a memorial would be very  prominent and conspicuous as thousands and thousands of visitors to this famous  seaside city would see it.</em></p>
  <p><em>Such a memorial would  help to mark the great events which are bringing East and West more closely  together than they have ever been before.</em></p>
  <p><em>The project has been  mentioned to the Secretary of State for India (Mr. Austen Chamberlain) and  though the India Office would have no connection with it, as from first to last  it would be entirely unofficial, he has been pleased to express his sympathy.  The Corporation and inhabitants of Brighton would welcome such a recognition.  The conspicuous part already played by Your Highness and your State in this  world conflict is well known throughout India and England and by extending your  generous help to this proposal Your Highness would be helping to perpetuate in  the minds of the English public the memory of those of our countrymen who gave  their lives for the Empire. The form of the memorial would necessarily depend  on the response made to this appeal. I have consulted Colonel Sir James Dunlop  Smith, Colonel Sir Swinton Jacob and Sir Walter Lawrence on the subject, and we  think that the erection of a &quot;Chattri&quot; of Indian design in some  prominent place in the town of Brighton would be very suitable. The cost may be  put at from £5000 to £10,000 according to size and material.</em></p>
  <p><em>If the suggestion  which I have ventured to make should be fortunate enough to meet with approval  and promises of support, a committee would be formed in the United Kingdom to  collect subscriptions and to carry out the wishes of the subscribers.</em></p>
  <p><em>With many apologies  for the trouble I am giving and hoping this will find Your Highness in the  enjoyment of the best of health.</em></p>
  <p><em>I remain<br>
    yours sincerely,<br>
    Daljit Singh<br>
    of Kapurthala</em></p>
  <p>To<br>
    His Highness Thakor Sahib Sir<br>
    Bhagvatsinghji Sagramji, G.C.I.E.,<br>
    of Gondal.</p>
