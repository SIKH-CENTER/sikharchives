  <h2>Short Story by Rudyard Kipling</h2>
  <img src="images\kipling1.jpg" width="172" height="250" class="popup_right1">
  <p>One of the best known writers of the era of the  Colonial British Empire, Rudyard Kipling (1865 -1936) wrote a entertaining  short story during World War I about a wounded Sikh soldier hospitalized at the  Brighton Pavilion writing a letter home to his brother in Amritsar. As many Sikh soldiers in Europe at the time were illiterate they would typically  hire someone to write the letter for them, in this case a doctor 'Sahib' at the  hospital.</p>
  <p>The story first appeared in the London  newspaper The Morning Post on 10th and 14th May, 1917 and in the New York magazine The  Saturday Evening Post on 19th May, 1917. It was subsequently published by  Kipling in 1918 in a book of short stories entitled The Eyes of Asia.</p>
  <p>Kipling's only son John died in 1915 at the Battle  of Loos, after which he wrote &quot;If any question why we died Tell them,  because our fathers lied.&quot; Partly in response to this tragedy, Kipling  joined Sir Fabian Ware's Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth  War Graves Commission), the group responsible for the garden-like British war  graves that can be found to this day dotted along the former Western Front and  all the other locations around the world where troops of the British   Empire lie buried.</p>
  <p>Kipling maintained a close affinity with the Indian soldiers and likely visited them at Brighton where he got the inspiration for this story. Out of his respect for the Indian soldiers,  after the great war and still feeling the pain of his son's death, Kipling still attended and opening ceremonies of the Chattri memorial commemorating the spot where the dead Sikh and Hindu soldiers from the Brighton hospitals had been cremated.</p>
  <p class="indent1">Brighton Herald 5 February 1921<br>
    <em> &lsquo;Around that marble Chattri on the open  Brighton Downs, in the presence of men of India as well as men from India, in  the presence of Rudyard Kipling, our story-teller of India and the poet of  Empire, met the very elements that most accurately symbolized that Empire. Thus  it was that on his visit to Brighton on  Tuesday, the Prince of Wales laid another stage in the building of Empire&rsquo;.</em></p>

  <p><span class="headline1">THE FUMES OF THE HEART</span><br>
    by Rudyard Kipling</p>
<p>Scene. Pavilion and Dome  Hospital, Brighton—1915.</p>
  <p>What talk is this, Doctor Sahib? This Sahib says he  will be my letter-writer? Just as though he were a bazar letter-writer at  home?... What are the Sahib's charges? Two annas? Too much! I give one.... No.  No! Sahib. You shouldn't have come down so quickly. You've forgotten, we Sikhs  always bargain.... Well; one anna be it. I will give a bond to pay it out of my  wound-pension when I get home. Sit by the side of my bed....</p>
  <p>This is the trouble, Sahib. My brother who holds  his land and works mine, outside Amritsar   City, is a fool. He is  older than I. He has done his service and got one wound out of it in what they  used to call war—that child's play in the Tirah [1] years ago. He thinks  himself a soldier! But that is not his offence. He sends me postcards,  Sahib—scores of postcards—whining about the drouth or the taxes, or the crops,  or our servants' pilferings or some such trouble. He doesn't know what trouble  means. I want to tell him he is a fool.... What? True! True! One can get money  and land but never a new brother. But for all that, he is a fool.... Is he a  good farmer? Sa-heeb! If an Amritsar Sikh isn't a good farmer, a hen doesn't  know an egg.... Is he honest? As my own pet yoke of bullocks. He is only a  fool. My belly is on fire now with knowledge I never had before, and I wish to  impart it to him—to the village elders—to all people. Yes, that is true, too.  If I keep calling him a fool, he will not gain any knowledge.... Let me think  it over on all sides! Aha! Now that I have a bazar-writer of my own I will  write a book—a very book of a letter to my fool of a brother.... And now we  will begin. Take down my words from my lips to my foolish old farmer-brother:—</p>
  <p>&quot;You will have received the notification of my  wounds which I took in Franceville [2]. Now that I am better of my wounds, I  have leisure to write with a long hand. Here we have paper and ink at command.  Thus it is easy to let off the fumes of our hearts. Send me all the news of all  the crops and what is being done in our village. This poor parrot is always  thinking of Kashmir.</p>
  <p>&quot;As to my own concerns, the trench in which I  sat was broken by a bomb-golee [3] as large as our smallest grain-chest.&quot;  [He'll go off and measure it at once!] &quot;It dropped out of the air. It  burst, the ground was opened and replaced upon seven of us. I and two others  took wounds. Sweetmeats are not distributed in war-time. God permitted my soul  to live, by means of the doctors' strong medicines. I have inhabited six  hospitals before I came here to England.  This hospital is like a temple. It is set in a garden beside the sea. We lie on  iron cots beneath a dome of gold and colours and glittering glass work, with  pillars.&quot; [You know that's true, Sahib. We can see it—but d'you think  he'll believe? Never! Never!] &quot;Our food is cooked for us according to our  creeds—Sikh, or Brahmin, or Mussulman and all the rest—When a man dies he is  also buried according to his creed. Though he has been a groom or a sweeper, he  is buried like some great land-owner. Do not let such matters trouble you  henceforth. Living or dying, all is done in accordance with the ordinance of  our faiths. Some low-caste men, such as sweepers, counting upon the ignorance  of the doctors here make a claim to be of reputable caste in order that they  may get consideration. If a sweeper in this hospital says he is forbidden by  his caste to do certain things he is believed. He is not beaten.&quot; [Now,  why is that, Sahib? They ought to be beaten for pretending to have caste, and  making a mock of the doctors. I should slipper them publicly—but—I'm not the  Government. We will go on.]</p>
  <p>&quot;The English do not despise any sort of work.  They are of many castes, but they are all one kind in this. On account of my  wounds, I have not yet gone abroad to see English fields or towns.&quot; [It is  true I have been out twice in a motor-carriage, Sahib, but that goes too  quickly for a man to see shops, let alone faces. We will not tell him that. He  does not like motor-cars.] &quot;The French in Franceville work continually  without rest. The French and the Phlahamahnds [Flamands] who are a caste of  French, are Kings among cultivators. As to cultivation—&quot; [Now, I pray,  Sahib, write quickly for I am as full of this matter as a buffalo of water]  &quot;their fields are larger than ours, without any divisions, and they do not  waste anything except the width of the footpath. Their land descends securely  from father to son upon payment of tax to the Government, just as in civilized  countries. I have observed that they have their land always at their hearts and  in their mouths, just as in civilized countries. They do not grow more than one  crop a year, but this is recompensed to them because their fields do not need  irrigation. The rain in Franceville is always sure and abundant and in excess.  They grow all that we grow such as peas, onions, garlic, spinach, beans,  cabbages and wheat. They do not grow small grains or millet, and their only  spice is mustard. They do not drink water, but the juice of apples which they  squeeze into barrels for that purpose. A full bottle is sold for two pice [4].  They do not drink milk but there is abundance of it. It is all cows' milk, of  which they make butter in a churn which is turned by a dog.&quot; [Now, how  shall we make my brother believe that? Write it large.] &quot;In Franceville,  the dogs are both courteous and industrious. They play with the cat, they tend  the sheep, they churn the butter, they draw a cart and guard it too. When a  regiment meets a flock, the dogs of their own wisdom order the sheep to step to  one side of the road. I have often seen this.&quot; [Not one word of this will  he or anyone in the villages believe, Sahib. What can you expect? They have  never even seen Lahore   City! We will tell him what  he can understand.] &quot;Ploughs and carts are drawn by horses. Oxen are not  used for these purposes in these villages. The field work is wholly done by old  men and women and children, who can all read and write. The young men are all  at the war. The war comes also to the people in the villages, but they do not  regard the war because they are cultivators. I have a friend among the  French—an old man in the village where the Regiment was established, who daily  fills in the holes made in his fields by the enemy's shells with dirt from a  long-handled spade. I begged him once to desist when we were together on this  work, but he said that idleness would cause him double work for the day  following. His grandchild, a very small maiden, grazed a cow behind a wood where  the shells fell, and was killed in that manner. Our Regiment was told the news  and they took an account of it, for she was often among them, begging buttons  from their uniforms. She was small and full of laughter, and she had learned a  little of our tongue.&quot; [Yes. That was a very great shame, Sahib. She was  the child of us all. We exacted a payment, but she was slain—slain like a calf  for no fault. A black shame!... We will write about other matters.]</p>
  <p>&quot;As to cultivation, there are no words for its  excellence or for the industry of the cultivators. They esteem manure most  highly [5]. They have no need to burn cow-dung for fuel. There is abundance of  charcoal. Thus, not irrigating nor burning dung for fuel, their wealth  increases of itself. They build their houses from ancient times round about  mountainous dung-heaps, upon which they throw all things in season. It is a  possession from father to son, and increase comes forth. Owing to the number of  Army horses in certain places there arises very much horse-dung. When it is  excessive, the officers cause a little straw to be lit near the heaps. The  French and the Phlahamahnds seeing the smoke, assemble with carts,  crying:—'What waste is this?' The officers reply:—'None will carry away this  dung. Therefore, we burn it.' All the cultivators then entreat for leave to  carry it away in their carts, be it only as much as two dogs can draw. By this  device horse-lines are cleaned.</p>
  <p>&quot;Listen to one little thing. The women and the  girls cultivate as well as the men in all respects.&quot; [That is a true tale,  Sahib. We know—but my brother knows nothing except the road to market.]  &quot;They plough with two and four horses as great as hills. The women of  Franceville also keep the accounts and the bills. They make one price for  everything. No second price is to be obtained by any talking. They cannot be  cheated over the value of one grain. Yet of their own will they are generous  beyond belief. When we come back from our work in the trenches, they arise at  any hour and make us warm drinks of hot coffee and milk and bread and butter.  May God reward these ladies a thousand times for their kindness!</p>
  <p>&quot;But do not throw everything upon God. I  desire you will get me in Amritsar City a carpet, at the shop of Davee Sahai  and Chumba Mall—one yard in width and one yard and a half in length, of good  colour and quality to the value of forty rupees. The shop must send it with all  charges paid, to the address which I have had written in English character on  the edge of this paper. She is the lady of the house in which I was billeted in  a village for three months. Though she was advanced in years and belonged to a  high family, yet in the whole of those three months I never saw this old lady  sit idle. Her three sons had gone to the war. One had been killed; one was in  hospital, and a third, at that time, was in the trenches. She did not weep nor  wail at the death or the sickness but accepted the dispensation. During the  time I was in her house, she ministered to me to such an extent that I cannot  adequately describe her kindness. Of her own free-will she washed my clothes,  arranged my bed, and polished my boots daily for three months. She washed down  my bedroom daily with hot water, having herself heated it. Each morning she  prepared me a tray with bread, butter, milk and coffee. When we had to leave  that village that old lady wept on my shoulder. It is strange that I had never  seen her weep for her dead son, but she wept for me. Moreover, at parting she  would have had me take a fi-farang [five franc] note for expenses on the  road.&quot; [What a woman! What a woman! I had never believed such women  existed in this Black Age.]</p>
  <p>&quot;If there be any doubt of the quality or the  colour of the carpet, ask for an audience of the Doctor Linley Sahib if he be  still in Amritsar.  He knows carpets. Tell him all I have written concerning this old lady—may God  keep her and her remaining household!—and he will advise. I do not know the  Doctor Sahib, but this he will overlook in war-time. If the carpet is even  fifty rupees, I can securely pay out of the monies which our lands owe me. She  is an old lady. It must be soft to her feet, and not inclined to slide upon the  wooden floor. She is well-born and educated.&quot; [And now we will begin to  enlighten him and the elders!]</p>
  <p>&quot;We must cause our children to be educated in  the future. That is the opinion of all the Regiment, for by education, even  women accomplish marvels, like the women of Franceville. Get the boys and girls  taught to read and write well. Here teaching is by Government order. The men go  to the war daily. It is the women who do all the work at home, having been well  taught in their childhood. We have only yoked one buffalo to the plough up till  now. It is now time to yoke up the milch-buffaloes. Tell the village elders  this and exercise influence.&quot; [Write that down strongly, Sahib. We who  have seen Franceville all know it is true.]</p>
  <p>&quot;But as to cultivation. The methods in  Franceville are good. All tools are of iron. They do not break. A man keeps the  tools he needs for his work and his repairs in his house under his own hand. He  has not to go back to the village a mile away if anything breaks. We never  thought, as these people do, that all repairs to tools and ploughs can be done  on the very spot. All that is needed when a strap breaks, is that each  ploughman should have an awl and a leather-cutter to stitch the leather. How is  it with us in our country? If leather breaks, we farmers say that leather is  unclean, and we go back from the fields into the village to the village cobbler  that he may mend it. Unclean? Do not we handle that same thing with the leather  on it after it has been repaired? Do we not even drink water all day with the  very hand that has sweated into the leather? Meantime, we have surely lost an  hour or two in coming and going from the fields.&quot; [He will understand  that. He chatters like a monkey when the men waste time. But the village  cobbler will be very angry with me!] &quot;The people of Franceville are  astonished to learn that all our land is full of dogs which do no work—not even  to keep the cattle out of the tilled fields. Among the French, both men and  women and little children occupy themselves with work at all times on the land.  The children wear no jewelry, but they are more beautiful than I can say. It is  a country where the women are not veiled. Their marriage is at their own  choice, and takes place between their twentieth and twenty-fifth year. They  seldom quarrel or shout out. They do not pilfer from each other. They do not  tell lies at all. When calamity overtakes them there is no ceremonial of grief  such as tearing the hair or the like. They swallow it down and endure silently.  Doubtless, this is the fruit of learning in youth.&quot;</p>
  <p>[Now we will have a word for our Guru at home. He  is a very holy man. Write this carefully, Sahib.] &quot;It is said that the  French worship idols. I have spoken of this with my old lady and her guru  [priest]. It is not true in any way. There are certainly images in their  shrines and deotas [local gods] to whom they present petitions as we do in our  home affairs, but the prayer of the heart goes to the God Himself. I have been  assured this by the old priests. All the young priests are fighting in the war.  The French men uncover the head but do not take off the shoes at prayer. They  do not speak of their religion to strangers, and they do not go about to make  converts. The old priest in the village where I was billeted so long, said that  all roads, at such times as these, return to God.&quot; [Our Guru at home says  that himself; so he cannot be surprised if there are others who think it.]  &quot;The old priest gave me a little medal which he wished me to wear round my  neck. Such medals are reckoned holy among the French. He was a very holy man  and it averts the Evil Eye. The Women also carry holy beads to help keep count  of their prayers.</p>
  <p>&quot;Certain men of our Regiment divided among  themselves as many as they could pick up of the string of such beads that used  to be carried by the small maiden whom the shell slew. It was found forty yards  distant from the hands. It was that small maiden who begged us for our buttons  and had no fear. The Regiment made an account of it, reckoning one life of the  enemy for each bead. They deposited the beads as a pledge with the regimental  clerk. When a man of the guarantors became killed, the number of his beads  which remained unredeemed was added to the obligation of the other guarantors,  or they elected an inheritor of the debt in his place.&quot; [He will  understand that. It was all very correct and business-like, Sahib. Our Pathan  Company arranged it.] &quot;It was seven weeks before all her beads were  redeemed because the weather was bad and our guns were strong and the enemy did  not stir abroad after dark. When all the account was cleared, the beads were  taken out of pawn and returned to her grandfather, with a certificate, and he  wept.</p>
  <p>&quot;This war is not a war. It is a  world-destroying battle. All that has gone before this war in this world till  now has been only boys throwing coloured powder at each other. No man could  conceive it! What do you or the Mohmunds [6] or anyone who has not been here  know of war? When the ignorant in future speak of war, I shall laugh, even  though they be my elder brethren. Consider what things are done here and for  what reasons.</p>
  <p>&quot;A little before I took my wounds, I was on  duty near an officer who worked in wire and wood and earth to make traps for  the enemy. He had acquired a tent of green cloth upon sticks, with a window of  soft glass that could not be broken. All coveted the tent. It was three paces  long and two wide. Among the covetous was an Officer of Artillery, in charge of  a gun that shook mountains. It gave out a shell of ten maunds or more [eight  hundred pounds]. But those who have never seen even a rivulet cannot imagine  the Indus. He offered many rupees to purchase  the tent. He would come at all hours increasing his offer. He overwhelmed the  owner with talk about it.&quot; [I heard them often, Sahib.] &quot;At last, and  I heard this also, that tent-owner said to that Artillery Officer:—'I am wearied  with your importunity. Destroy to-day a certain house that I shall show you,  and I will give you the tent for a gift. Otherwise, have no more talk.' He  showed him the roof of a certain white house which stood back three kos [six  miles] in the enemy country, a little underneath a hill with woods on each  side. Consider this, measuring three kos in your mind along the Amritsar Road. The  Gunner Officer said:—'By God, I accept this bargain.' He issued orders and  estimated the distance. I saw him going back and forth as swiftly as a lover.  Then fire was delivered and at the fourth discharge the watchers through their  glasses saw the house spring high and spread abroad and lie upon its face. It  was as a tooth taken out by a barber. Seeing this, the Gunner Officer sprang into  the tent and looked through the window and smiled because the tent was now his.  But the enemy did not understand the reasons. There was a great gunfire all  that night, as well as many enemy-regiments moving about. The prisoners taken  afterwards told us their commanders were disturbed at the fall of the house,  ascribing it to some great design on our part, so that their men had no rest  for a week. Yet it was all done for a little green tent's sake!</p>
  <p>&quot;I tell you this that you may understand the  meaning of things. This is a world where the very hills are turned upside down,  with the cities upon them. He who comes alive out of this business will forever  after be as a giant. If anyone wishes to see it let him come here or remain  disappointed all his life.&quot;</p>
  <p>[We will finish with affection and sweet words.  After all, a brother is a brother.] &quot;As for myself, why do you write to me  so many complaints? Are you fighting in this war or I? You know the saying: 'A  soldier's life is for his family: his death is for his country: his discomforts  are for himself alone.' I joined to fight when I was young. I have eaten the  Government's salt till I am old. I am discharging my obligation. When all is at  an end, the memory of our parting will be but a dream.</p>
  <p>&quot;I pray the Guru to bring together those who  are separated.</p>
  <p>&quot;God alone is true. Everything else is but a  shadow.&quot;</p>
  <p>[That is poetry. Oh—and add this, Sahib.]</p>
  <p>&quot;Let there be no delay about the carpet. She  would not accept anything else.&quot;</p>
  <p>The End</p>
  <p class="footnote1">Notes</p>
  <p>The long heading to the letter as collected did not  appear in The Morning Post but there was a short one, as follows:</p>
  <p>'From Jowahir Singh, Naik, 291st Sikhs, in the big  hospital with the dome which is at Brighton, England, to my elder brother Ram  Singh, who is the farmer holding seven and a half acres on the north side of  the village of Amirkot, about two miles out of the city of Amritzar following  the Lahore road. Let this be delivered in accordance with the rules of the  Government.'</p>
  <p>1. The Tirah - The Expeditionary Force of October  1897 - April 1898 received the India Medal (1893-1902), with bars 'Punjab  Frontier' and 'Tirah'. Tirah refers to an area south of the Khyber Pass.</p>
  <p>2.  Franceville - any town in France.</p>
  <p>3. bomb-golee The second word means a bullet or  ball.</p>
  <p>4. Two-pice - One pice is 3 pies or a farthing (one  quarter of an old penny); one penny equals 12 pies or 4 pice, so a full bottle  cost one halfpenny.</p>
  <p>5. They esteem manure most highly - In India there  was a shortage of all fuels, and straw was mixed with dried cow-dung to burn as  a source of heat; as a result the land did not have the benefit of the manure  for fertilizer, which for centuries has been used to enrich the soil in Europe.</p>
  <p>6. Mohmunds - One of the border tribes on the North  West Frontier, living in an area west of Peshawar and along the Kabul river.</p>
