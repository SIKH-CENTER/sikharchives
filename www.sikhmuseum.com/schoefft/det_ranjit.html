<p><img src="images\details\large\det_sardars.jpg" width="500" height="352"></p>
<p>Maharaja  Ranjit Singh sitting on a large red cushion is the focal point of Schoefft's  painting. Although Schoefft never met Ranjit Singh, having arrived at the Sikh  Empire two years after his death, Schoefft had the opportunity to study  existing paintings and make sketches of the Maharaja that he then used for this  painting years later on his return to Europe.</p>
<p>Maharaja  Ranjit Singh is portrayed in the painting as wearing a string of jewels in his  turban as well as a jewel armband. The armband is likely holding the legendary  Kohinoor diamond, at 186 carats, the &lsquo;Mountain of Light&rsquo; was the largest diamond  in the world.</p>
<div class="body_indent1"><p><em>Cross-legged in a  golden chair, dressed in simple white, wearing no ornaments but a single string  of enormous pearls round the waist, and the celebrated Koh-y-nur, or mountain  of light on his arm, (the jewel rivalled if not surpassed, in brilliancy by the  glance of fire which every now and then shot from his single eye as it wandered  restlessly round the circle,) - sat the lion of Lahore.</em><br>

  W.G.  Osborne, London, 1840</p>
<p><em>Camp  Ferozepore, Nov. 30, 1838<br>
  He is exactly like an  old mouse, with grey whiskers and one eye..Runjeet had no jewels on whatever,  nothing but the commonest red silk dress...Next to him sat Heera Singh, a very  handsome boy, who is Runjeet's favourite, and was loaded with emeralds and  pearls.</em><br>

<p>Sitting  to the immediate left of the Maharaja is a figure covered with a robe but  without any jewelry. Raja Kharakh Singh, the Maharaja&rsquo;s  son and heir  apparent would likely be wearing jewels as he is depicted in Schoefft's other  painting, The Court of Lahore. Given the lack of jewelry, the figure is likely  one of Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s Giani&rsquo;s (religious leaders). Osborne mentions that the  Maharaja&rsquo;s religious guides would sometimes be given the honor of being seated next  to him and given the nature of the religious scene depicted in the painting;  this is likely the case here.</p>
<div class="body_indent1"><p><em>Rajah Sher Sing was  seated on his right hand, and Rajah Heera Sing, his minister's son, upon his  left, the only two individuals who are allowed a seat in his presence on public  occasions, with the exception of his son and heir, Kurruck Sing, though in  private that privilege is sometimes accorded to the three Gooroos, or priests,  who act as his spiritual advisers.</em><br>

<p>Standing  directly behind the Maharaja and waving what appears to be a pot of incense on  a chain is another prominent religious leader Bhai Gurmukh Singh. Bhai Gurmukh  Singh also appears in Schoefft's other painting of The Court of Lahore. A  prominent religious figure and advisor to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Bhai Gurmukh  Singh continued his role during the reign of Maharaja Sher Singh. In fact Dr. Honigberger  in his account of Schoefft's visit to Darbar Sahib mentions that Maharaja Sher  Singh requested Schoefft to paint a portrait of Bhai Gurmukh Singh and was very  impressed by the results. Bhai Gurmukh Singh acted as Schoefft and  Honingbergers chief host and protector during their visit to Darbar Sahib.</p>
<p>Two  attendants wearing beautiful red shawls can be seen standing beside the  Maharaja. One with an umbrella canopy and another waving a fly whisk called a  chaur over the Maharaja. The chaur and the umbrella were traditional symbols of  royalty used by  Maharaja&rsquo;s. The canopy and chaur fly whisk are also used  wherever the Guru Granth Sahib is present by Sikhs as symbols of the Sikh  Scriptures Royal Authority as head of the religion. Chaur attendants can be  seen on the right side of the painting as well with the attendant to the extreme right  also depicted holding an umbrella canopy.</p>
