<p>Standing  next to a Nihang warrior, Maharaja Sher Singh is easily recognizable, being one  of the first Sikhs at the royal court to tie up his beard in the Rajasthan  style. In Schoefft’s painting Sher Singh is shown wearing a helmet rather than  the traditional Sikh turban, This is not unusual and quite similar to a sketch  of Sher Singh by W.G. Osborne based on his 1838 visit to the Sikh Empire,  Osborne’s sketch may have been the basis for Schoefft’s depiction of the  Maharaja with a helmet in this painting.</p>

</div>
<p>In  Schoefft's painting Sher Singh is presented in a low-key manner. In Schoefft's  other epic painting,  The Court at  Lahore, the center focal point of that scene is the vibrant and dynamic Sher  Singh on his horse, while Maharaja Ranjit Singh plays a secondary role as a  distant figure in the background. In Schoefft's painting of Ranjit Singh at  Darbar Sahib the roles are reversed. Here Maharaja Ranjit Singh is clearly the  focal point of the painting with Sher Singh playing the role of a supporting  character appearing in the background near the edge of the field of view.</p>
<p>During  the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the only one of the alleged sons attributed  to him by various Ranis that he acknowledged was Sher Singh. Along with his  true biological son and heir Raja Kharak Singh, Sher Singh was the only  step-son allowed in the presence of Ranjit Singh.</p>
<div class="body_indent1"><p><em>Rajah Sher Sing was  seated on his right hand, and Rajah Heera Sing, his minister's son, upon his  left, the only two individuals who are allowed a seat in his presence on public  occasions, with the exception of his son and heir, Kurruck Sing, though in  private that privilege is sometimes accorded to the three Gooroos, or priests,  who act as his spiritual advisers.</em><br>
  The  Court and Camp of Runjeet Sing<br>
  W.G.  Osborne, London, 1840</p>
  <p><em>Though reported to be  the Maha Rajah's son, Sher Sing's father has never thoroughly acknowledged him,  though his mother always insisted on his being so. A brother of Shere, by the  same mother, has been even worse treated than himself, not being permitted to  appear at court, and no office given him, either of profit or honour.</em><br>

    Henry  Edward Fane, London, 1842</p>
