<h2>Schoefft at Darbar Sahib</h2>
<div class="picture_left1"><img src="images\honingberger1.jpg" width="272" height="350"></div>
  <p>An eyewitness account  of August Schoefft's  visit to Darbar Sahib and  the circumstances surrounding the painting comes from the memoirs of Dr. Martin  Honigberger. Honingberger was one of the longest serving European in the Sikh Empire  having served as Maharaja Ranjit Singhs personal physician and later serving  his successors in that capacity until the very end of the  Empire itself. </p>

<p>Being  a fellow German speaker, Honingberger acted as Schoefft's host during his stay  in the Sikh Empire and accompanied him on his visit to Amritsar along with  Maharaja Sher Singh. Honingberger provides us with a detailed eyewitness  account of events surrounding the visit to Darbar Sahib and the  interactions between Maharaja Sher Singh and Schoefft which led to the idea for  the painting in the first place.</p>
<p>In  his memoirs Dr. Honigberger  tells us of a misunderstanding  that led to a major incident at Darbar Sahib in which Schoefft was nearly  killed by a Nihang led mob while working on his painting. Given the  circumstances of the events that transpired it is truly a miracle that Schoefft  survived at all and that the invaluable sketchs that he had prepared for his famous  painting were not lost.</p>
<p>Unlike  today, a visit to Darbar Sahib in the early to mid-19th century was not  without danger for Europeans. The Nihang sect with its headquarters at the Akal  Bunga (Akal Takht) had always been openly hostile towards Europeans and  considered a visit to Darbar Sahib by Europeans as an insult to the Sikh  faith, even if ordered or approved by the Maharaja himself whose authority they  only marginally accepted.</p>

<p><em>Between the Beas and the Sutledge, at Captain Wade's Camp<br>
  October 19th. 1832 <br>
  On the eve of the festival, the king [Maharaja Ranjit Singh] had the kindness to have me shown the famous tank of Umbritsir, in the centre of which is the golden temple, in which they preserve the Grant, or sacred book of the Seikhs. The fanaticism and madness of the Akhalis or religious warriors, who always crowd into this sacred place, would threaten any European visitant with almost certain danger, if he had not a strong guard. It was not wanting on this occasion. I went to the temple on an elephant, with a strong escort of Seikh cavalry, the animal on which I was mounted, pushing the formidable Akhalis to the right and left, without hurting any of them; and the temple was occupied by a regiment of Seikh infantry. In its precinct I paid a visit to an old man, celebrated for his sanctity; he was waiting for me, as was likewise the governor of the town, an equally respectable old man, who was there by the king's order, to conduct me through the temple. He took me by the hand, and led me all over it. If he had let me go, the Akhalis would no doubt have done me some ill turn; but I was sacred while under the arms of the old Dessa Sing.</em><br>

    <em> They [Nihangs] were  an unmitigated nuisance and danger during the Maharaja's reign, and more than  once they attempted his life. Their insolent swagger and hatred of Europeans  made them so obnoxious during the  early  years of the British occupation and annexation, that visits to the Temple of  the Darbar Sahib at Amritsar, where the Akal Bungah formed their head-quarters  were always attended with some risk. </em><br>

<p>Thirty-five  Years in the East<br>
  L.M. Honigberger, London, 1852</p>



<p><em>As  an instance of the fanaticism of the Nahungs ( the robber-pack I have before  mentioned ), I may relate an occurrence which took place at Umritsir, in which  a German friend of mine, Herr August Schofft, was near losing his life by their  fury. This gentleman is an artist of some celebrity ( at this time in St.  Petersburg ), and he, accompanied by his lady, visited the East Indian  Presidencies shortly before my severe illness ; and having met with great  success in consequence of his skill in oil painting, he came to visit me at  Lahore, At this time the court happened to be at Umritsir, and I received an  order from Sheer Sing to present myself at that place with my guest. On our  arrival, it happened that one of the principal Sikh priests, named Baii  Goormuck Sing, was present, and the maharajah desired Herr Schofft to furnish  him with a specimen of his abilities, by sketching a portrait of the Baii ;  which he accordingly did, in pencil, and the likeness was a striking one. The  result was, that the maharajah and several of the principal persons of the  court sat to him for their portraits, and Herr Schofft accordingly met with  great respect and consideration.</em></p>
<p><em>I  may mention here, that Herr Schofft had kept copies of these portraits, and  that on his return to Europe he painted, from these and other sketches which he  had taken, a large picture of the Durbar of Lahore, which is considered to be  his masterpiece, and which was purchased from him by Louis Phillipe, and is  still, I believe, at Paris</em></p>
<p><em>In  the centre of the city of Umritsir  is a gigantic reservoir of water, from the midst of which rises a magnificent  temple, where the Grunth ( the holy book of the Sikhs ) is read day and night.  Around this sheet of water are the houses of the maharajah, the ministers,  sirdars, and other wealthy inhabitants. The square itself is called Durbar  Saheb. At the time of Runjeet Sing and Sheer Sing, the scene which presented  itself at this temple, when the court was at Umritsir, was of the most  brilliant description, and at certain periods all the notabilities of the  Punjab were to be seen collected together in all the splendour of oriental  pageantry. During our stay at Umritsir it happened that the inhabitants gave an  invitation to the court to visit the sacred temple at night time, when it was gorgeously  illuminated ; and Sheer Sing honoured me with his commands that we should  accompany him, sending us a richly caparisoned elephant for our accommodation,  Sheer Sing inquired of my friend, Herr Schofft, if he could take for him a  drawing of that brilliant scene. He answered in the affirmative, but proposed  to the maharajah that it would be better if the scene was sketched under the  effect of daylight instead of the imperfect one of the illumination, He was  accordingly ordered to adopt that suggestion. On the following morning, we went  to the house of the Baii Goormuck Sing, who had promised, on the previous  evening, to send a servant to point out to us the most elevated terrace in the  square ( which was in the mansion of Runjeet Sing ), from which Herr Schofft  could get a view of the temple and the surrounding buildings ; on this place he  prepared his atelier. He occupied the whole of the day in sketching the scene,  and on the following day he also went there, but alone, to continue his work.  About noon, having that morning received some newspapers from my native place,  Kronstadt, I went to him, and he desired me to read to him the news whilst he  was painting. About an hour before sunset, his work was nearly finished, and as  the court had already departed for Lahore, whither we wished also to proceed  immediately, he requested me to go to our quarters and to procure some boxes in  which he could enclose his paintings. Our quarters were outside the city, in a  garden formerly belonging to the prince No-Nehal Sing. When I reached home I  immediately forwarded to him a horse and servants, as he had told me he should  finish his painting within an hour after I had left him,</em></p>
<p><em>Herr  Schofft was a great smoker, and attracted attention in Umritsir from his scarcely  ever being seen abroad without having a cigar in his mouth. Now smoking is considered  by the Nahungs and the Sikhs as sinful, or rather criminal ; more especially in  or near such a holy place as their chief sanctuary ; Herr Schofft was aware of  this, and therefore studiously avoided smoking whilst engaged in taking this  sketch, It happened however, that, as is customary with painters, He now and  then in the course of the work placed one of his pencils in his mouth, in order  to keep it separate from those in the left hand, whilst using another with the  right. This was observed by those who stood watching his operations from  beneath the terrace, and they imagined, in consequence, that he was smoking.  The rumour first spread about in whispers one to another, and as the impression  became confirmed, a general indignation manifested itself ; and loud  exclamations were soon heard, that the feringhee ( frank ) was committing  sacrilege by smoking in their sacred place. The people speedily increased in  numbers, and a clamorous mob soon surrounded the palace. The artist was at  first unconscious of the cause of the gathering-, but he soon became aware by  their shouts and threats, that he was in some way the object of their fury, and  that he was consequently in a dangerous position. He had no sooner, however,  made up his mind that his best policy would be to effect his escape, if  possible, unperceived ; when some of the ringleaders of the mob, who had made  their way through the palace, rushed upon the terrace, and attempted to seize  him. Being a strong and vigorous man, he succeeded in wrenching himself from  their grasp, and made his way to the staircase, which to his dismay he found  crowded by the mob, who were making their way up. Knowing that his only chance  lay in breaking through them as quickly as possible, he struck out right and  left, and having the advantage of being always uppermost of those who attempted  to stay his progress, he succeeded in reaching the bottom with some few  bruises, Here, however, the affair presented a still more formidable aspect ;  for no sooner had he reached the foot of the staircase, then he was seized by  the collar and other parts of his coat by half-a-dozen of the mob, and saw at a  little distance the glittering of several of their weapons. He gave himself up  for lost, and in the energy of despair threw open his coat, and taking  advantage of a slight confusion at the moment ( caused by a struggle to get  possession of the gold watch which he had held in his hand and had at the same  instant relinquished to them ), he slipped from the coat, which was held on all  sides, and pushing away those in front of him, he succeeded in reaching the  street ; here his nether garments fell, in some unaccountable manner, about his  feet, and he stumbled and fell into a miry puddle which was immediately before  him : he instantly sprang to his feet, and rustled to the entrance of a dark  stable close adjacent. The mob concluded they had now secured their prey, but  they were mistaken; for Schofft had, fortunately, whilst passing this stable on  a previous occasion in my company, entered it, and noticed its back entrance,  which led into the bazaar ; through this back door he then gained the bazaar,  and from thence ( the mob all the way at his heels ), reached the house of his  protector, Baii Goormukh Sing'. The door was immediately shut, and Schofft was  saved.</em></p>
<p><em>He  there met with a kind reception, and on cleansing himself from the mire and  blood with which he was covered, it was found that He had not only received  several contusions on the head from the iron knobs on the shields of the  Nahungs, with which they had struck at him ; but also a sword wound on the  back, by which his braces had been cut through, which at once explained to him  the cause of his fall into the mire at so critical a moment. The mob not  evincing any inclination to disperse, the police interfered, and compelled them  to retire.</em></p>
<p><em>During  all this time I was at home, expecting his arrival every moment; and at length,  when it was quite dark, some of the persons whom I had sent with the horse,  came back to me with the news of the riot, and informed me that he was in the  hands of the mob. This filled me with consternation, and I immediately sent to  the commander of the fortress ( a friend of mine ), soliciting him to assist  and endeavour to save the unfortunate painter. With great promptitude, he despatched  a whole company of regular troops to the city, and on their way they met  Schofft on his road home ; he having been disguised in an oriental costume, and  sent on, horseback accompanied by an escort of police. My first care was to  dress his wounds; and  to early on the  following morning we left Umritsir for Lahore.  I may add that the watch, and the plate, &amp;c., which I had sent with his  luncheon, were of course lost ; but the painting was subsequently recovered.</em></p>
