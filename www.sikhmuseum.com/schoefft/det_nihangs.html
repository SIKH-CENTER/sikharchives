<p><img src="images\details\large\det_nihangs1.jpg" width="500" height="340"></p>
<p>Ever  present at Darbar Sahib, Schoefft depicted a few members of the Nihang sect in his painting which  are easily distinguishable by their blue robes and weapons in their conical  turbans. The fierce Nihangs were once powerful and feared warriors that had  significant influence in the Sikh Kingdom. Their headquarters were the Akal  Bunga (Akal Takht) at Amritsar and from here they had control and dominance  over religious affairs at Amritsar. </p>
<p>Their  relationship with the Sikh Royal Court seems to have been a complex one. There  was a marginal acceptance by the Nihangs of Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s rule, while  maintaining their autonomy as a group. They took great pleasure in a campaign  of insults directed towards Maharaja Ranjit Singh in public and this tradition continued to  his successors including Maharaja Sher Singh in the time of Schoefft's visit.  Schoefft experienced the wrath of the Nihangs first hand on his visit to Darbar  Sahib and barely escaped with his life.</p>
<div class="body_indent1"><p><em>In addition to the  regular and irregular army the Lahore government has also in its pay a body of  irregular cavalry (to the number of between two and three thousand) called  Akalees. They are religious fanatics, who acknowledge no ruler or laws but  their own ; think nothing of robbery, or even murder, should they happen to be  in the humour for it, Runjeet Singh himself having on more than one occasion  narrowly escaped assassination by them. They are without any exception the most  insolent and worthless race of people under the sun. They move about constantly  armed to the teeth, insulting everybody they meet, particularly Europeans. and  it is not an uncommon thing to see them riding about with a drawn sword in each  hand, two more in their belt, a matchlock at their back, and three or four  quoits fastened round their turbans. The quoit is an arm peculiar to this race  of people : it is a steel ring, varying from six to nine inches in diameter,  and about an inch in breadth, very thin, and the edges ground very sharp : they  throw it with more force than dexterity, but not so (as alleged) as to be able  to lop off a limb at sixty or eighty yards. In general, the bystanders are in  greater danger than the object aimed at. Runjeet Singh did much towards  reducing this worthless race of people to a state of subjection, but he only  partially succeeded, and latterly they have become more intolerant than ever.  They, however, fight with desperation, and are always employed upon the most  dangerous service.</em><br>
  Travels in Kashmir and the Panjab<br>
  Baron Charles Hugel, translated from German with Notes by Major T.B. Jervis,  1845,</p>
<p><em>As we approached the  Akalees, those savage hordes set up a scornful shout ; some galloped out of the  ranks and, with uplifted hands, abused the Maharaja ; His Highness [Maharaja  Sher Singh], however, who appeared quite used to this sort of thing, took no  notice whatever, and said he was glad that they had not pelted him with mud, as  they had frequently done to Runjeet Singh on similar occasions. My elephant  unfortunately became tired just at this junction, which afforded these ruthless  clamourers a welcome opportunity to manifest their insolence. </em><br>
  Travels  in India including Sinde and the Punjab, Vol I<br>
  Captain Leopold von Orlich, translated by H. Evans Lloyd, London, 1845</p></div>
<p>With  the end of the Sikh Empire and its annexation by the British, the Nihangs were eventually driven from their power and influence over religious affairs at Amritsar.</p>
<div class="body_indent1"><p><em>The Akalis Tower,  Umritzir. For whatever purpose this elegant and fanciful building was erected,  its present name is derived from the circumstance in the war of the Sikhs, when  a band of Akalis (those furious fanatics, in their blue dresses and bands and  chains of steel, who had constituted themselves the guardians of the tank and  temple) were persued here after the city was taken, and driven from floor to  floor till the remnant finally precipitated themselves from the summit rather  than yield and confess themselves vanquished.</em><br>
