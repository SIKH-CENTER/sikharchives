<h2>Maharaja Ranjit Singh</h2>

<p>While the painting of Maharaja Ranjit Singh at Darbar Sahib listening to the Guru Granth Sahib being recited is an imaginary scene that August Schoefft's never witnessed, history does provides us with eyewitness accounts of Maharaja Ranjit Singh at  times of religious devotion.</p>

<p>Like  many of his Sikh subjects, Maharaja Ranjit Singh seems to have incorporated the  reading of the Guru Granth Sahib into his daily routine. Although he is well  known for his debauchery, drinking and women where important Sikh religious  principles were completely ignored by him, at the same time he seems to have also  shown an underlying reverence for the Guru Granth Sahib. Illiterate and unable  to read or write, Maharaja Ranjit Singh still made it a point to spend a few  hours in devotional prayers each day having the sacred verses of the Guru  Granth Sahib read to him.</p>
          <div class="body_indent1"><p><br>
            <em>Although no bigot, and  active in restraining the zeal and fanaticism of the Akalees, and others.  Runjeet Singh is yet scrupulous in the performance of all the prescribed  observances of the Sikh faith, and, for a certain number of hours every day,  has the Grunth read before him by Gooroos, and is liberal in his charities to  Fuqeers and men of reputed sanctity.<br>

              Henry  T. Prinsep, Calcutta  1834          </p>
<p><br>
  <em>He was a devout  believer in the doctrines, and a punctual observer of the ceremonies of his  religion. The Grunth, the sacred book of the Sikhs, was constantly read to him,  and he must have been familiar with the moral precepts it incalculated.<br>

<p><br>
  <em>The Grunth, or Sacred  Book, is now read to him by the Gooroos, or priests, who are magnificently  attired for the occasion, and seated on the richest carpets and silks. After  this he again holds his durbar, and finishes the business of the day by a ride  on horseback.<br>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Not  only did Maharaja Ranjit Singh spend time dedicated every day to listening to  the Guru Granth Sahib, the Maharaja also seems to have developed a unique  approach of reaching decisions on issues when he could not easily make up his  mind.</p>
          <div class="body_indent1"><p><br>
            <em>We  accordingly set the old Faqueer Uzeezoodeen to work with him, and much to our  satisfaction heard, in the course of the evening, that on his mentioning our  wishes to the Maharajah, he had consulted the Grunth, or sacred volume of the  Sikhs, and that, as the oracle was propitious, we might be prepared to set off  for Lahore in four days's time.</em></p>
<p><em>Runjeet  Sing rarely undertakes any expedition of importance without consulting this  holy book. When unable to make up his mind upon the probable success of any  measure he has in contemplation, he takes a very simple method of solving his  doubts, by placing between the leaves of the Grunth two slips of paper, on  which is written the object of his wishes, and on the other the reverse. The  papers are selected by one of his Gooroos or priests, without being looked at,  and should the first one presented to him prove propitious to the expedition he  may contemplate, he undertakes it with the greatest confidence of success, if  otherwise, all idea of prosecuting it is immediately given up.<br>

<p><br>
  <em>It  is no uncommon practice of Runjeet Singh, when he contemplates any serious  undertaking, to direct two slips of paper to be placed on the Grunth Sohil, or  sacred volume of the Sikhs. On the one is written his wish, and on the other  the reverse. A little boy is then brought in, and told to bring one of the  slips, and, whichever it may happen to be, his Highness is as satisfied as if  it were a voice from heaven.<br>

          <p>Schoefft provides us with an artist&rsquo;s imaginary rendition of what it may have  been like when Maharaja Ranjit Singh visited Darbar Sahib, but we are fortunate  enough to have an a  eyewitness account of a actual visit by Ranjit Singh  to Darbar Sahib.</p>
          <p>In  1838 George Eden the Earl of Auckland and Governor General of India accompanied  by his sister Emily Eden and commander-in-chief Sir Henry Fane had a rare  opportunity to enter the Sikh Empire and visit Maharaja Ranjit Singh at Lahore.  The aged Maharaja was by now in poor health and partially paralyzed, only a  year away from his death, but he still though it important enough to take his  visitors on a journey from Lahore, the political capital of the Sikh Empire to  Amritsar, it&rsquo;s spiritual capital to visit Darbar Sahib.</p>
          <p>Only  a handful of Europeans had ever been allowed to visit Darbar Sahib during  Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s reign. We are fortunate that Emily Eden recorded the events that  transpired in December 1838 in her journal as the aged Maharaja and his guests entered  the precincts of Darbar Sahib. </p>
          <p>Eden&rsquo;s  account of the Maharaja&rsquo;s humility in rubbing dust on his forehead as he enters  Darbar Sahib is remarkable for someone of his status and power and is in line with  the Sikh belief that we are all equal in the eyes of God, the king or the begger  are the same. After a visit to the inner sanctum of Darbar Sahib Eden records  that &lsquo;Runjeet took us up to a sort of  balcony he has in one corner of the square.&rsquo;, this balcony is likely the very same one that Schoefft would spend time on years later as he  worked on his sketch for his epic painting.</p>
          <div class="body_indent1"><p><br>
            Up the Country,  Volume II<br>
            Emily  Eden, London, 1866</p>
            <p>Letter  dated: Camp Umritzir, Dec 10, 1838</p>
<p><em>Runjeet  takes off his shoes and stoops down, and puts some of the dust on his forehead;  it amounts to taking off a hat, and only answers to the same respect that we  should wish anybody to pay on entering one of our own churches.….</em></p>
          <p><em>The  temple is of pure gold; really and truly covered completely with gold, most beautifully  carved completely with gold, most beautifully carved, till within eight feet  from the ground, and then there are panels of marble inlaid with flowers and  birds – very Solomonish altogether. There are four large folding-doors of gold.  We walked round it, and then Runjeet took us in.</em></p>
          <p><em>There  was a large collection of priests, sitting in a circle, with the Grooht, their  holy book, in the centre, under a canopy of gold cloth, quite stiff with pearls  and small emeralds. The canopy cost 10,000l. Runjeet made G. and F. and me sit  down with him on a common velvet carpet, and then one of the priests made a  long oration, to the effect that the two great ponentates were now brothers and  friends, and never could be otherwise. Then G. made a speech to the same effect,  and mentioned that the two armies had joined, and they could now conquer the  whole  world; and Runjeet carried on the  compliment, and said that here, the oracle had prompted him to make this  treaty, and now they saw that he and the English were all one family. In short,  you never saw two gentlemen on better terms with themselves and each other. G.  presented 16,000 rupees, and they, in return, gave us some very fine shawls. I  think, mine was scarlet and gold, but the Company&rsquo;s baboo twisted it up in such  haste that I did not see it well.</em></p>
          <p><em>When  all this was over, Runjeet took us up to a sort of balcony he has in one corner  of the square, and by that time the bridge, the temple, the minarets,  everything was illuminated. Shere Singh&rsquo;s palace was a sort of volcano of  fireworks, and large illuminated fish were swimming about the tank. It was a  curious sight, and supposed, by those who know the Sikhs, to be a wonderful  proof of confidence on Runjeet&rsquo;s part.</em></p>
