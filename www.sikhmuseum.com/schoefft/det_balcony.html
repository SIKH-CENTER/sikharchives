<p>The  vantage point of Schoefft’s painting and the balcony where he depicted the  Maharaja sitting and listening to the Granth in his painting had previously been the private residence of  Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The Maharaja already had the large Ram Bagh Palace with  it’s extensive gardens in Amritsar that he would use as his official residence  on visits to Amritsar. The Ram Bagh palace was not near Darbar Sahib, so Ranjit  Singh constructed a new palace overlooking the Darbar Sahib complex. According  to court historian Sohan Lal Suri, the Maharaja built his own bunga (residence/palace)  towards the north-west of Darbar Sahib, close to the sacred tank [1]. </p>
<p>This  palace would then be used by the Maharaja on his visits to Darbar Sahib and  provided an excellent vantage with a view of the entire Darbar Sahib complex  and sacred pool. This same balcony is likely where Maharaja Ranjit Singh took  Emily Eden and her brother Governor General Lord Auckland for a grand view following  their visit to the inner sanctum of Darbar Sahib.</p>
<div class="body_indent1"><p><em>When all this was  over, Runjeet took us up to a sort of balcony he has in one corner of the  square, and by that time the bridge, the temple, the minarets, everything was  illuminated. </em><br>

<p>Dr.  Martin Honigberger who accompanied Schoefft on his visit to Darbar Sahib tells  us that Ranjit Singh’s residence provided the best vantage point to paint the  Darbar Sahib complex from. It is from this balcony vantage point that Schoefft  set up his canvas and drawing materials, spending two days their working on  preliminary studies for his famous painting.</p>
<div class="body_indent1"><p><em>On the following  morning, we went to the house of the Baii Goormuck Sing, who had promised, on  the previous evening, to send a servant to point out to us the most elevated  terrace in the square ( which was in the mansion of Runjeet Sing ), from which  Herr Schofft could get a view of the temple and the surrounding buildings ; on  this place he prepared his atelier. He occupied the whole of the day in  sketching the scene, and on the following day he also went there, but alone, to  continue his work. </em><br>
