          <p> The painting by Viennese artist, August Schoefft, of Maharaja Ranjit   Singh sitting in devotion on a balcony overlooking the Darbar Sahib   complex at Amritsar is both stunning and full of details. Painted over a century and a half ago at the zenith of the Sikh Empire, it is one of the most important paintings from that era.<br>
            <br>
            Spending over a year in the Sikh Empire, Schoefft painted portraits and   scenes while gathering the material to later produce his two most   well-known works. Epics on a grand scale, but also with meticulous detail, Schoeffts paintings of <em>The Court of Lahore</em> and <em>Maharaja Ranjit Singh at Darbar Sahib</em> are widely admired today as the definitive   depictions of the Sikh Royal Court at the height of its power under the   Lion of Punjab. </p>
          <p> What may surprise many is the fact that Schoefft’s grand painting is a   work of historical imagination and artistic license. Having arrived at   the Sikh Empire two years after the death of the Emperor of Punjab,   Schoefft never had the opportunity to meet Maharaja Ranjit Singh or   witness this scene at Darbar Sahib.<br>
            <br>
            Schoefft's painting is analogous to a well written historical novel   where the author researches an era to get the details of the times   correct and then uses his creative imagination to populate the pages   with believable characters in plausible circumstances, all set in   historical context. In a similar manner, Schoefft used his vivid imagination to portray a   scene that he never saw but one where, as a keen observer, artist and   historian, he effectively blends reality with imagination into a   cohesive grand epic on canvas that is both believable and realistic in   its rendition. </p>
