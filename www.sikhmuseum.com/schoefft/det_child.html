<p>The  small child shown playing with a bird on the balcony has been assumed at first glance by  some to be a picture of Duleep Singh, the last claimant to the Lahore throne  but evidence suggests otherwise. Chronologically Duleep Singh was only 9 months  old at the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh death; the child shown in the painting  is considerably older.</p>
<p>Maharaja  Ranjit Singhs only biological offspring,  officially recognized by him as his son  was Raja Kharak Singh. Maharaja Sher Singh who occupied the throne during  Schoefft's visit was a step-son who had succeeded to the throne after a power  struggle in which Kharak Singhs widow Rani Chand Kaur was defeated in battle.  During Maharaja Sher Singh&rsquo;s rule when Schoefft observed the Royal Court and  made his studies concerning the various figures that he would later paint into  the scene at Darbar Sahib, there is no mention of Duleep Singh at the court or  recognition of him as a legitimate son of Ranjit Singh. </p>
<p>It  was only following Maharaja Sher Singhs death that a number of factions put  forward their own claimants of various alleged sons of Ranjit Singh as successors  to the Lahore throne. During this tumultuous time we first see the rise to  prominence of Duleep Singh who was promoted as a son of Ranjit Singh by  a faction led by the Dogra brothers Dhian Singh and Gulab Singh. By this time  Schoefft had already left the Sikh Empire.</p>
<p>Historian F.S.  Aijazuddin  identifies the  child as the son of one of Maharaja Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s Sardars who had fallen in  battle.[1] A number of eyewitness accounts mention such children as being present  at Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s Court and this practice may likely have continued during  Maharaja Sher Singhs rule and been observed by Schoefft during his time in the  Sikh Empire.</p>
<div class="body_indent1"><p>On ordinary days his  son, his prime-minister, and one or two others, form, with servants, his party.  Three or four children, generally sons of his old servants, who have been  killed in his service, scramble about the carpet with the tame pigeons.<br>
Five  Years in India, Volume 1<br>
Henry  Edward Fane, London, 1842</p>
  <p><em>There were a little  boy and girl about four and five years old, children of some of Runjeet&rsquo;s  sirdars who were killed in battle, and he always has these children with him,  and has married them to each other. They were crawling about the floor, and  running in and out between Runjeet and George, and at one time the little boy  had got his arm twisted around George&rsquo;s leg.</em><br>
    Up  the Country, Volume I<br>
    Emily  Eden, London, 1866</p>
<p><em>The Maharajah is fond  of children; and many of his sirdars&rsquo; sons are bred up under his eye, and  instructed in riding, and the use of arms; by this means they become attached  to him, and when able to assume commands, they never fail of succeeding to  important ones.</em><br>
