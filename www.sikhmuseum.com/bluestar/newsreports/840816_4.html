                      <p>Violence broke out at an emotional  demonstration by 500 Sikhs in Toronto  last night and at least 12 were arrested. </p>
                      <p>Metro Police were involved in  several scuffles with demonstrators, but there were no reports of serious  injuries. </p>
                      <p>One ethnic relations squad officer  was taken to hospital with minor cuts to his finger and lip after being struck  on the back and knocked down with a ceremonial sword. </p>
                      <p>One Sikh dressed in traditional garb  went to draw his sword and was pounced on by half a dozen policemen. He was  led away in handcuffs.</p>
                      <p>The demonstration was outside  Toronto Harbor Commission headquarters where the Indian Consulate had organized  a party to celebrate India's  Independence Day. </p>
                      <p>Guests arriving and leaving were  surrounded in their cars. Some cars were kicked and pelted with eggs.</p>
                      <p>Each time a car left, mounted police  and police on foot moved in to keep the demonstrators back.</p>
                      <p>The Sikhs accuse the Indian  government of genocide against their people in India  and claim up to 15,000 Sikhs have been killed in the Punjab.</p>
                      <p>&quot;This is a day of mourning for  us,&quot; said Balbir Singh, a member of the Weston Road   Sikh Temple.</p>
                      <p>Organizers of the demonstration said  they wanted the public to know what was going on in India.</p>
