                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      June 7, 1984</p>
                      <p>From Associated Press and Reuter<br>
                          <br>
                        NEW DELHI — Indian Government troops  backed by rocket and tank fire invaded the Golden Temple compound in the Sikh  holy city of Amritsar yesterday, killing 250 Sikh militants, capturing 450  others and seizing heavy weapons, officials said. At least 48 soldiers were reported  killed.</p>
                      <p>Fierce fighting raged into the night  inside the 12-block-square compound as machine-gun-firing extremists held out  in the golden-domed temple at the heart of the<br>
                        most sacred Sikh shrine in Punjab state.</p>
                      <p>Lt.-Gen. K. Sunderji told report­ers  in the Punjabi capital of Chandi­garh  that 48 soldiers were killed and 12 others missing are presumed dead. At least  100 soldiers and 50 militants were wounded, 450 people arrested and nearly 300  firearms seized, including an unspecified number of anti-tank missiles and  rocket launchers, he said.</p>
                      <p>Troops also attacked 38 other Sikh  shrines, five Hindu temples and one mosque in other areas of the troubled  state, he said, adding there were no casualties.</p>
                      <p>Among those captured at the Golden Temple  was Harchand Singh Longowal, president of the Sikhs' main political party, the  Akali Dal.</p>
                      <p>H. K. Wali, a Government spokesman,  said a group of defiant militants barricaded inside the heart of the temple,  the Akal Takht or Seat of Immortal Power, were the last to surrender. He could  not confirm reports that radical Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was  among those holed up. Mr. Bhindranwale, who is accused of masterminding a  terrorist cam­paign that has claimed at least 350 lives in Punjab  in the past six months, has lived in the Akal Takht for the past three months. <br>
                        Meanwhile, the Indian consulate in Vancouver was closed by  Sikhs protesting against the attack. About 250 Sikhs jammed both entrances to  the downtown consulate and pre­vented staff from entering. About 250 B.C. Sikhs  visiting Punjab are believed trapped in the  state by a round-the-clock curfew imposed on Sunday.</p>
                      <p>In addition to the shoot-on-sight  curfew, authorities have suspended all rail and road traffic in the state,  sealed the borders, banned journal­ists and declared the region off-limits to  foreigners. Thousand of troops were sent in on the weekend. </p>
                      <p>Sikh militants in India had threatened a bloodbath if the Gold­en Temple was attacked. The seventeenth-century  shrine is the head­quarters of a two-year-long agita­tion for greater  political, economic and religious autonomy in Punjab,  the only Indian state in which Sikhs are a majority.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Wali said he believes the raid  had quashed Sikh terrorism. &quot;An act here and there can not be dis­counted,  but we believe this will break the back of the terrorist movement.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Troops took heavy casualties, he  said, because they had avoided fir­ing on the temple itself. &quot;They became  easy targets because they did not do what in a warlike situa­tion an army would  do — that is, obliterate the target.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Lt.-Gen. Ranjit Singh Dayal, a Sikh  who was appointed security adviser in Punjab  last weekend, said army tanks fired on rebel positions in the temple compound  but no tanks entered the grounds. Troops also fired rockets to destroy  fortifications, he said.</p>
                      <p>News of the military action spread  quickly through India's  Sikh community, touching off violence in several areas.</p>
