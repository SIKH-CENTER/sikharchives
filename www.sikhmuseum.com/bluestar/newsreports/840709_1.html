                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      July 9, 1984</p>
                      <p>NEW DELHI (Reuter) — The Sikh Akali  Dal party will renew agitation in Punjab next week by sending unarmed suicide  squads to try to force Indian troops to leave the Golden Temple in Amritsar,  the Press Trust of India news agency reported yesterday.</p>
                      <p>The decision was made in the Punjab  state capital of Chandigarh  by a committee of 11 Akali Dal officials who took over the party after the arrest  of several of its leaders in recent weeks, PTI said.</p>
                      <p>The Akali Dal has led a campaign for  religious and political concessions for Sikhs for nearly two years. Growing  sectarian violence accompanied the campaign and last month the Indian army  attacked the Golden   Temple, the Sikhs' holiest  shrine, to crush extremists based there. About 1,000 extremists and 90 troops  died.</p>
                      <p>The party decided to send  &quot;Shaheedi Jathas,&quot; groups of would-be martyrs, to the Temple after it had repeatedly  called for army forces to leave it. Shaheed means martyr. </p>
                      <p>The army has said it will withdraw  from Punjab only when all Sikh extremists  fighting a guerrilla war for a separate state have been detained and their arms  seized.</p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, PTI said extremists  killed a woman early yesterday in a village near Amritsar.</p>
                      <p>Violence also flared in two northeastern  states where two people died and a local politician was seriously injured on  Saturday, the agency said. The deaths occurred in Tripura State  when police opened fire to stop a clash between supporters of Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi's Congress (I) Party and the state's ruling Marxist party.</p>
                      <p>And a district leader of the Congress  (I) was ambushed in northeastern Assam   State and shot through  the abdomen, PTI said.</p>
                      <p>Assamese leaders have launched a  campaign to force the eviction of large numbers of mainly Moslem settlers from  the state where about 3,000 people died in ethnic unrest last year. </p>
                      <p>In the northern border state of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said yesterday that security  at Indian airports had been tightened and more than 250 people arrested after  the hijacking of an Indian airliner to Pakistan last week.</p>
                      <p>Police in the state capital of Srinagar said more than  250 people, many of them suspected Sikh, extremists, had been rounded up in the  state in the past two days.</p>
                      <p>The Himalayan region bordering Pakistan was  quiet after a curfew was reimposed and paramilitary troops redeployed during  the weekend to disperse demonstrations against the firing of the state's Chief  Minister Farouq Abdullah, they said.</p>
                      <p>In New Delhi,  officials said a Government white paper on the Golden Temple  assault was expected to be released today</p>
