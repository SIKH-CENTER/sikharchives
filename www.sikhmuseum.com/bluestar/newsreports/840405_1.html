                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      April 5, 1984</p>
                      <p>CHANDIGARH, India  (AP) —Police arrested about 300 people yesterday during a general strike to  protest against the growing violence in northern India, and a Sikh terrorist group  threatened to kill a politician every day until its demands are met.</p>
                      <p>A home-made bomb was tossed into a  crowd near the town of Moga, 305 kilometres  northwest of New Delhi in Pun­jab state, police  in Chandigarh  reported. Five people were seri­ously wounded, said police, who blamed Sikh  terrorists for the attack.</p>
                      <p>The Government declared Chandigarh, joint capital of vio­lence-torn Punjab and Haryana states, a &quot;disturbed  region.&quot; That declaration empowers po­lice to shoot lawbreakers on sight  and to make searches and arrests without warrants.</p>
                      <p>In Parliament in New Delhi, the opposition demanded that Prime  Minister Indira Gandhi's Government step down for fail­ing to curb the  terrorism, which has claimed more than 125 lives in two months.</p>
                      <p>Militant Sikhs are waging a campaign  for greater religious and political autonomy in Punjab  state. While a minority in Hindu-dominated India,  Sikhs are the majority in Punjab.</p>
                      <p>Sikh attacks on Hindus and  Government officials have prompted some retaliatory at­tacks, and several  members of Parliament have said during debates that they fear wide­spread  rioting if the terrorism is not quelled.</p>
                      <p>More than 350 people have been slain  in Punjab in the past three years.</p>
                      <p>The Government says the his­toric Golden Temple  in Amrit­sar,  seat of the Sikh faith, is being used as an arsenal and a sanctuary for  fugitives.</p>
                      <p>The Deshmesh Regiment, a  little-known Sikh terrorist group, said in a letter to a newspaper in Punjab state that it would mur­der one political figure a  day until the Government lifts a ban on a radical Sikh student organi­zation.</p>
                      <p>The group has claimed respon­sibility  for slaying two Hindu politicians and one moderate Sikh leader in the past  week. </p>
                      <p>Authorities outlawed the All-India  Sikh Students Federation last month, charging that it advocated separatism and  fanned tensions between Hindus and Sikhs.</p>
                      <p>The general strike, called by the  right-wing Indian People's<br>
                        Party, closed markets, business­es  and factories in New Delhi, the Jammu region and the  states of Haryana and Himachal Pra­desh.</p>
                      <p>In the Indian capital, hundreds of  strikers hurled rocks and damaged several city buses. Police used metal-tipped  bamboo staves to scatter crowds that attempted to set buses on fire. A post  office was ransacked.</p>
                      <p>Police said about 300 people were  arrested, including about 200 activists from opposition parties who were  charged with violating a ban on public gather­ings of more than four people. </p>
                      <p>Essential services, banks, schools  and Government offices remained open.</p>
                      <p>During the strike, paramilita­ry  troops patrolled the streets of Panipat, Karnal and other towns in Haryana  state, which borders both Punjab and the territory of Delhi.</p>
                      <p>Police in Haryana and Punjab also have &quot;shoot-to-kill&quot; powers. </p>
                      <p>Vishwa Nath Tiwari, 48, was given a  state funeral in Chandi­garh  yesterday.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Tiwari, a member of the upper  house of Parliament and a Gandhi supporter, was shot Tuesday in his living  room.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. Gandhi's Government denied  yesterday that it had agreed to amend the constitution to classify the Sikh  faith as a separate religion. The adminis­tration had agreed only to dis­cuss  such a move, Home Affairs Minister Prakash Sethi said. </p>
                      <p>Sikhs resent being classified as  part of Hinduism. Unlike Hindus, they believe in one god and reject the caste  system.</p>
