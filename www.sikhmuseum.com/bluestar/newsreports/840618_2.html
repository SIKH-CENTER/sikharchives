                      <p class="fs14italic">Time<br>
                      June 18, 1984</p>
                      <p align="center"><img src="images\840618_2a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="487"></p>
                      <p>The elegant marble floored courtyard  of the gilded Golden Temple in Amritsar  was strewn with bodies and blood. The once serene and peaceful 72 acre temple  complex, the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion, stood scarred and bruised  after 36 hours of fierce fighting between militant Sikhs and Indian government  troops. In sweltering heat and the dust of the battle's aftermath, black crows  and vultures perched on the temple's balustrades in search of grisly carrion.  For the first time in the 400 year history of the Golden Temple,  the 24-hour prayer vigil had ceased.</p>
                      <p>The most fanatical leader of Sikh extremists,  Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, 37, who had provoked the violence, lay among  the dead. Just weeks before he had vowed to defend to the death his  supporters' demands for increased religious and political autonomy. &quot;Let them  come,&quot; he had said. &quot;We will give them battle. If die we must, then  we will take many of them with us.&quot;</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840618_2b.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="335" class="pictureright1">In ordering her troops to storm the  temple, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi took her biggest political gamble since  she declared a national emergency in 1975. Last week's decision could add to  the turmoil of a nation already torn by violence. Some Indian commentators  voiced fears for the future of the world's largest democracy. &quot;What  happened inside the Golden Temple is a turning point in India's modern  history,&quot; said the eminent Sikh Historian Khushwant Singh. But Mrs.  Gandhi apparently felt she had no choice but to attack. Bhindranwale and his  followers had stockpiled guns, rifles, antitank missiles, rocket launchers,  hand grenades and mortars inside the temple, in grim contrast to the shrine's  jewel like chambers and cupolas. The defenders' stiff resistance ended in  slaughter: 259 Sikhs and 59 soldiers killed, an additional 90 Sikhs and 110  soldiers wounded. Unofficial figures placed  the dead at more than a thousand.</p>
                      <p>At week's end the violence had not  yet subsided, and the Indian army extended its 24-hour curfew in most of the  north­western state of Punjab. Several hundred  Bhindranwale loyalists who had managed to escape the siege of the temple  continued to wage hit-and-run attacks against troops in Amritsar. They also looted shops, set fires  and killed civilians. An additional 100 Sikh extremists surfaced in Rajasthan.  a state near the Pakistani border, where they called upon Sikh members of the  army to rebel. Some of them did defect, while other Sikhs apparently donned  army uniforms in an attempt to infiltrate and disrupt the front line troops  that shield India against  potential attacks from its bitter enemy, Pakistan. The rebellion was swiftly  quashed.</p>
                      <p>Agitation by both moderate and  extremist Sikh factions over the past two years had brought violence in Punjab to alarming levels. In the past four months alone,  more than 300 people had died in Sikh inspired violence. At the same time,  tensions from last month's rioting among Hindus and Muslims in Bombay had built to such a degree that politicians  began questioning Mrs. Gandhi's control over the country. There was  speculation that further instability could cause her governing Congress (I) Party  to suffer a serious setback in the national elections scheduled to be held by  next January.</p>
                      <p>Sikh outrage at the assault on the  temple echoed throughout India  and around the world. Ignoring curfew laws, hundreds of Sikhs rioted in Punjab; they also caused havoc in a number of Indian cities.  In New Delhi  angry Sikhs demanded Bhindranwale's body for cremation and vowed to keep his  legend alive. &quot;If one Bhindranwale dies,&quot; Sikhs at a New Delhi demonstration shouted, &quot;a  thousand are born.&quot; Two militants brandishing swords attacked the Indian  consulate in Vancouver, Canada, leaving it a shambles.  Security was increased around Indian missions in the U.S., Canada,  Britain, West Germany, The Netherlands and Denmark, where  there are significant Sikh populations.</p>
                      <p>The crisis came to a head when, in  an effort to press home its demands for religious and regional autonomy, the  Sikhs' Akali Dal Party announced that it would begin to block grain shipments  to the rest of India from Punjab, which is the nation's breadbasket. The action  would have cut off 65% of the country's crucial grain reserves. threatening  widespread famine.</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840618_2c.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="310" class="pictureleft1">Three days before the attack, Mrs.  Gandhi made an urgent appeal on national radio and television to all Sikhs to  end their agitation. She outlined a framework for a settlement. &quot;Let us  sit around the table and find a solution,&quot; she pleaded. She had already  agreed to most of the Sikh demands for religious autonomy and was willing to  amend the constitution to distinguish Sikhs from Hindus. But Mrs. Gandhi felt  that if she gave in to the Sikh demand for political autonomy, she would risk a  Hindu backlash.</p>
                      <p>On Sunday the government ordered a  24 hour curfew, and told all journalists and photographers to leave Punjab. (Authorities later confiscated the film of those who  had refused to comply.) Roads across the state borders and the airports were  closed, trains and buses stopped running, and telephone and telegraph wires  were cut. The usually thriving Punjab came to  a halt, cut off from the rest of the world. About 4,000 government troops  surrounded the Golden   Temple and ordered out  the 3,000 Sikhs who live there, as well as the crowds that enter daily for  worship. Many heeded the warnings, but 1,000 extremists defiantly remained  inside the temple.</p>
                      <p>Bhindranwale held out in what is  described as &quot;the throne of the timeless&quot; in the temple's basement.  His loyal followers took up positions they had been fortifying for months with  sandbags, steel armor and bricks. When army troops finally stormed the defenses  Tuesday evening, they met heavy resistance from rockets and machinegun fire.  Pinned down by a far superior, better armed force than they anticipated, army  troops called for reinforcements of tanks and artillery. After six hours, the  machine guns fell silent and army sharpshooters closed in, backed up by troops  with bayonets. When army troops finally stormed the basement, they found the  bullet-riddled bodies of Bhindranwale and his two top lieutenants.</p>
                      <p>Bhindranwale's death was in the  proud, warring tradition of Sikhism. The religion was founded in the 15th  century as a monotheistic synthesis of Hinduism and Islam. Sikhs believe in  having a direct, personal relationship with God, rejecting Hindu idolatry and  the caste system. True Sikhs do not smoke, and the men do not cut their beards  or hair, believing that spiritual power flows through long hair. India's 15  million Sikhs are known for being ambitious, hardworking and hospitable. Their  gurdwaras, or holy places, throughout India offer free lodging and food  for any traveler who happens by.</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840618_2d.jpg" alt="" width="436" height="500" class="pictureright1">Industrious and ambitious, the Sikhs  have turned Punjab, one of the few areas in which they form a majority, into a  model of agricultural efficiency, thereby helping make India  self sufficient in wheat. Sikh politicians are demanding economic improvements  from the central government, such as higher wheat prices and more investment in  Punjab. Some Sikhs want a form of regional  autonomy that would give to Punjab authority  in all areas of state government except currency, railways, communications  and defense. Others want the city of Chandigarh,  which is also the capital of the neighboring Hindu state of Haryana, to be  designated exclusively as Punjab's political  capital.</p>
                      <p>The defiant and charismatic Bhindranwale,  known to his followers as &quot;the guiding light,&quot; emerged in 1978 as the  most radical of the Sikh leaders. He possessed a mythic sense of his own  destiny and claimed from an early age that he was fated to lead the Sikhs in their  struggle for autonomy. Gradually distancing himself from the more moderate  Akali Dal, Bhindranwale began in 1981 to use holy places as sanctuaries and  military training grounds for Sikh fundamentalists rallying around him. The  tall, lean leader always wore a sword as well as a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver  on a gun belt with silver bullets. He preached that Sikhs were a religious group  apart from Hindus and Muslims, with a divine destiny to rule themselves and escape  the corrupt influences of Hindu and Western values.<br>
  <br>
                        By ordering the assault on the temple,  Mrs. Gandhi has placated critics who accused her of dangerous inaction on Sikh  terrorism. But she has seriously harmed her standing with moderate Sikhs who  did not support Bhindranwale's fanaticism although they revered the Golden Temple  as a shrine of peace. &quot;I don't understand why Mrs. Gandhi gave the  order,&quot; said Historian Singh. &quot;We had been given assurances that  there would never be an armed intervention, but they have gone back on their  word. No serious Sikh can entertain thoughts of talking to Mrs. Gandhi  now.&quot; Only through cautious maneuvering and concessions to moderate Sikhs,  it seems, can Mrs. Gandhi hope to heal the wounds left by last week's attack  and preserve, indeed strengthen. her country's unity.</p>
