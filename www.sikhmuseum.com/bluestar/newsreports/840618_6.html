                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      June 18, 1984</p>
                      <p>NEW DELHI (Reuter) — Indian President Zail  Singh made an impassioned appeal for national unity last night after thousands  of Sikhs joined nationwide prayers of pro­test against the army's storming of  the Golden Temple  in Amritsar. </p>
                      <p>The President, a Sikh, said the  Government sent in the security forces reluctantly because extremists had  taken over Sikh shrines. Speaking on radio and television, he appealed to  Indians to maintain the country's unity and integrity.</p>
                      <p>&quot;My agony is all the more because  I am the representative of the whole nation,&quot; he said.</p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Indira  Gandhi, moving to curb Sikh militants abroad, has written to British Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher, a spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs  said. </p>
                      <p>No details were disclosed but Mrs.  Gandhi appealed to foreign governments, in an interview for Australian and  Canadian radio, not to aid Sikh separatists in their countries.</p>
                      <p>An employee of Canada's Department  of External Affairs said in an interview that the Government has not heard from  Mrs. Gandhi.</p>
                      <p>&quot;We have not received any letter,  Telex or any communication,&quot; said Pierre Alarie, on weekend duty for the  department since Friday night.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Alarie said if there is any  direct communication between the Indian leader and Prime Minister Pierre  Trudeau, it will probably be made public today.</p>
                      <p>Sikhs have staged angry protests in  several capitals since the army action on June 6, when about 1,000 people were  killed. Last week, Sikhs abroad proclaimed a Sikh republic  of Khalistan with headquarters in London.</p>
                      <p>Responding to a call by the Akali  Dal, the main Sikh party, Sikhs held prayers in temples throughout India to commemorate those who died at the Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>Security forces were on the alert in  several areas and armed police cordoned off the main Sikh shrines in New Delhi.</p>
                      <p>No incidents were reported but the  army arrested 90 suspected extremists and found arms and ammunition in raids in  troubled Punjab state at the weekend,  state run radio said.</p>
                      <p>In her interview, which was also carried  by the British Broadcasting Corp., Mrs. Gandhi defended the decision to send in  the army. She said repeated attempts were made to reach agreement with the  Akali Dal before force was used.</p>
                      <p>The army &quot;was not used against  the Golden Temple. It was not used against the Sikh  religion. It was used to take out terrorists who had been indulging in murder,  arson and looting,&quot; she said.</p>
                      <p>More than 900 Sikhs and 84 soldiers  were reported killed.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. Gandhi said she believed  reports that foreign powers were involved in the unrest, although she did not  know which powers.</p>
                      <p>A senior Indian official has said  Sikh extremists received military training in Pakistan.</p>
