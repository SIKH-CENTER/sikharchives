                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      June 18, 1984</p>
                      <p>By SUZANNE GOLDENBERG</p>
                      <p>A government-in exile of Khalistan,  formed in the wake of the military raid two weeks ago on the Sikhs' sacred Golden Temple  in Amritsar, is calling for economic sanctions  and political pressure against India.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Canada  should not be giving more money to India. We should cut off all aid to  India,&quot; Kuldip Singh,  who says he is the shadow government's consul-general to Toronto, said at a news conference on Saturday.</p>
                      <p>He also suggested people boycott Air  India  flights to that country.</p>
                      <p>The new provisional government sees  public pressure and diplomacy as key to raising the status of the Sikh minority  in India,  he said. </p>
                      <p>Although the provisional government  is new, he said Khalistani passports were first issued in 1976. Khalistan is  the name given to an independent Sikh state.</p>
                      <p>&quot;The Indian Government, by  raiding the Golden   Temple, has declared  itself to be at war with the government of Khalistan and the Sikhs,&quot; said  Darshan Singh, who says he is a representative of the Khalistani government.</p>
                      <p>&quot;We consider ourselves at war  with the Indian Government.&quot;</p>
                      <p>He said uneasy relations between the  Sikh dominated Punjab state and India  since 1947 are based on years of deception. &quot;The Hindu Government used our  good faith.&quot; </p>
                      <p>Punjab was the last state to fall under  British colonialism and therefore has a history of independence, he said. </p>
                      <p>According to members Of Toronto's  Sikh community at the conference, including those who said they were  representatives of the Khalistani government, India's suppression of Sikhs is  indicative of the Government's hostility to other religious minorities.</p>
                      <p>They also accused the Indian Government  of doctoring news releases to discredit the Sikh sepratist movement.</p>
                      <p>Kuldip Singh said the death toll for  the assault on the Golden Temple and 45 other temples around Amritsar was  as high as 15,000. (The Indian army says 492 Sikhs and 84 soldiers died in the  assault on the Golden   Temple, while independent  reports put the toll at more than 1,000 Sikhs and 200 soldiers.) </p>
                      <p>He said reports of recent findings  of drugs and arms caches in the temple are untrue and are part of India's  propaganda machine. </p>
                      <p>Contrary to early reports, he denied  that Sikh separatist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale committed  suicide. &quot;His body was riddled with 72 bullets.&quot;</p>
                      <p>&quot;The reports we are getting  from India are not as they  are,&quot; said Amrit Singh, who served as translator for a man who fled to Canada from Punjab  five days ago. </p>
                      <p>The 24 year old, who refused to give  his name for fear of reprisals against his family in India, travelled undercover in  police vans to make his escape.</p>
                      <p>The man said he was forced to cut  his beard and hair and remove his turban to disguise himself. He said young Sikhs are routinely  taken by the military and &quot;no one knows what happens to them unless they  return home.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Should a number of Sikhs be  seen standing together, they are simply shot with no questions asked,&quot; the  man said. A member of the Sikh Student Federation, he said many of his friends  were killed in the latest Government assault: </p>
                      <p>During the raid on the Golden Temple,  the man was in hid house 12 kilometres from the city. He said Sounds of  fighting are routine in that area, so he did not realize what was happening.</p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, Indian. Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi said in a radio interview yesterday that she ordered the assault  on the Golden Temple in the interest of a unified  nation. </p>
                      <p>&quot;That kind of anti-social and  anti-national action (by Sikh extremists in the temple) cannot be tolerated.  Obviously, there was something going on there that was not in the national  interest,&quot; she said on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s Sunday Morning  program.</p>
                      <p>She said attempts to reach an  agreement with Sikhs in the temple failed. &quot;We were trying to talk to  them. We felt that maybe if we could reach an agreement with them, they could  stop it themselves.&quot; She said a bid for a settlement failed because of  &quot;differences among themselves (the Sikhs), perhaps rivalries, and maybe  some of them were afraid.&quot; </p>
                      <p>Mrs. Gandhi said she would win back  the loyalty of Sikhs by teaching them the truth. &quot;It's a question of  healing their wounds. I mean, they may be hurt, but it doesn't necessarily mean  they're aliienated.&quot;</p>
