                      <p>By Elaine Carey</p>
                      <p class="fs14italic">Toronto Star<br>
                      June 8, 1984</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840608_6a.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="235" class="pictureright1">India's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi  &quot;created a monster she couldn't control&quot; in radical Sikh leader  Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a local academic observer says.</p>
                      <p>Bhindranwale's body was discovered  in Amritsar's Golden Temple  after a two-day siege by government troops.</p>
                      <p>Gandhi actively promoted  Bhindranwale's rise as head of a radical wing of the Sikh nationalist Akali  party two years ago in an effort &quot;to fracture the movement&quot;, said  Arthur Rubinoff, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. </p>
                      <p>But the move backfired. Bhindranwale  became a messiah and Punjab state's most  powerful religious leader. He eventually forced Gandhi to order the army to  storm his headquarters in the Golden   Temple, the Sikh's most  sacred shrine.</p>
                      <p><strong>Enhanced  chances</strong></p>
                      <p>&quot;What he did was a very symbolic  act,&quot; said Rubinoff. &quot;The government of India has put down political  uprisings before but when you do this to religious Institutions, there are  memories that will last.&quot;</p>
                      <p>But Rubinoff and other academics  interviewed by The Star believe that by quelling the extremist movement, Gandhi  has enhanced her chances of re-election in a national vote that must be held  within the next year.</p>
                      <p>The 13 million Sikhs in India are a majority in Punjab  state, but make up only 2 per cent of the country's 700 million people.  &quot;Any quelling of extremist minorities only enhances the majority  position,&quot; said Rubinoff.</p>
                      <p>Jayant Lele, a professor of Indian  politics at Queen's University in Kingston,  said sympathy with Bhindranwale and his extremists has declined rapidly among  the general Sikh popula­tion in recent months as the level of violence  increased.</p>
                      <p><strong>A martyr is  born</strong></p>
                      <p>David Taylor, a professor of South  Asian studies at Britain's London University,  said Gandhi held off to avoid converting the large body of moderate Sikhs into  backers of the extremists. But he predicts that Bhindranwale will now become a  martyr to his people.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Sikhs put great emphasis on  martyrs and unless Mrs. Gandhi is able to find a political settlement fairly  quickly, some new leader or group will emerge for whom Bhindranwale will be a  hero.&quot;</p>
                      <p>&quot;She was forced to deal with  the extent of the violence,&quot; he said. &quot;Although this will put an end  to plots to kill senior politicians, it won't necessarily cope with sporadic  violence.</p>
