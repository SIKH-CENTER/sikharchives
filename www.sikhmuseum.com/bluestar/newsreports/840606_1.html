                      <p class="fs14italic">Toronto Star<br>
                      June 6, 1984</p>
                      <p>NEW DELHI (DPA-AP) — Special units of the  Indian army backed by tanks today stormed the Golden  Temple in Amrit- sar, the  fortress-like complex in Punjab held by an  estimated 3,000 Sikhs.</p>
                      <p>All-India radio reported that Sikh  extremists fired machine guns and rockets at troops besieging their holiest  shrine, and that fighting was still raging.</p>
                      <p>The report sold some Sikhs holed up  in the 17th century compound had surrendered and told officials the remaining  occupants planned &quot;to blow up the Golden Temple.&quot;  It did not give details. The 15-acre compound is located in Amritsar, 400 kilometres (250 miles) northwest of New Delhi.</p>
                      <p>The official broadcast said  &quot;terrorists are firing machine guns and have used rockets&quot; in fierce  firefights with the security forces. The military gave no details of casualties  on either side. No foreign journalists were allowed near the area and  independent reports of the battles could not be obtain­ed.</p>
                      <p><strong>Leader in  hiding</strong></p>
                      <p>In New Delhi,  an official spokesman told United Press Interna­tional that security forces  did not enter the Golden Temple, where militant Sikh leader Jarnail Singh  Bhindranwale - a fundamentalist priest and the alleged mastermind behind Punjab's wave of violence — reportedly was taking  shelter. </p>
                      <p>In operations throughout  Sikh-dominated Punjab state, army units also  broke into at least 24 of the 32 other Sikh shrines under siege, arresting  hundreds of people and capturing large quantities of arms and ammunition, the  re­ports said.</p>
                      <p>Sporadic fighting was also re­ported  outside some of the temples as army and police broke up demonstrations.</p>
                      <p>Government officials said Harchand  Singh Longowal, president of the Sikh's Akali Dal political party, and another  key Sikh leader, Gurcharan Singh Tohra, had surrendered.</p>
                      <p>But Bhindralwale was still be­lieved  to be holed up in the innermost sanctuary of the Golden Temple.  He has vowed to kill him­self rather than be captured or have his men lay down  their arms. </p>
                      <p>The white marble temple with a  copper dome covers an area of about 12 city blocks and is surrounded on all  sides by a lake where worshippers bathe to wash away their sins.</p>
                      <p>The Sikhs are a minority in India, but they form a 52-per-cent majority of  the population in Punjab, where their Akali  Dal party is seeking religious and political autonomy</p>
