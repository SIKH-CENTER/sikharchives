                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      June 22, 1984</p>
                      <p>NEW DELHI (Reuter) — Most curfew  restrictions were lifted, travel bans were relaxed and all but two Sikh shrines  were reopened yesterday as life in India's troubled Punjab state slowly returns  to normal.</p>
                      <p>But security forces continued their  crackdown on Sikh militants. Authorities arrested 27 more suspected extremists  and hunted others who threw a bomb in a cinema in neighboring Haryana state,  injuring three people, police reported.</p>
                      <p>Government sources estimate about  4,500 people have been rounded up but say some top extremists are still at  large.</p>
                      <p>A Government spokesman said that all  Sikh temples except Amritsar's Golden Temple,  the religion's holiest shrine, and a place of worship at Muktsar in western Punjab, had been ordered to reopen.</p>
                      <p>Many temples were shut two weeks ago  while the army searched for suspects and weapons.</p>
                      <p>The spokesman said night curfews in  Punjab were lifted except in Amritsar,  where about 1,000 people were killed on June 6 when the temple complex — a  haven for Sikh extremists blamed for the deaths of hundreds — was stormed by  soldiers.</p>
                      <p>Bans on the assembly of four or more  people and the carrying of weapons in public places were still in force in the  state.</p>
                      <p>Civilian flights into Amritsar, suspended for the past three weeks, were  expected to resume today, but Punjab remained  off limits to foreigners.</p>
                      <p>The Government refused a demand  yesterday by the five highest priests of the Sikh religion to reopen the Golden Temple,  which was severely damaged in the fighting. </p>
                      <p>The high priests, known as the Panj  Pyares (the Five Loved Ones), called on the army to withdraw immediately from  the temple so that repairs could start.</p>
                      <p>Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,  continuing her joint meetings with Sikh and Hindu groups from around India, said  there was nothing to be proud of in the army's success. &quot;It was a painful  decision,&quot; she said.</p>
