                      <p>By Gerald Uttiug Toronto Star</p>
                      <p>NEW    DELHI — &quot;What happened to me,&quot; Krishna Kapoor told The Star,  &quot;was just a foretaste of what happened to my poor homeland.&quot;</p>
                      <p>The headlines of the past month have  told what happened to Kapoor's home­land, the northwestern Indian state of Punjab; how he has become an exile in his own country has  not.</p>
                      <p>Kapoor is not his real name. But his  story is true, and he is not someone produced by the government of India to back up its claims about terrorism in  the Punjab.</p>
                      <p>Kapoor's main worry in talking to  me, a conversation arranged by a relative, is that somebody in Toronto will  somehow find out who he is and where he now lives.</p>
                      <p><strong>Demonstrations in Toronto</strong></p>
                      <p>&quot;I have had a death sentence  passed on me by Bhindranwale,&quot; he said.</p>
                      <p>&quot;I never did anything to him  but he would have killed me, and I am afraid that some of his followers may  still try to carry out his death warrants.&quot;</p>
                      <p>(Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale,  leader of the extremist. Sikh faction in the Golden Temple,  was killed in the recent battle with units of the Indian army.)</p>
                      <p>&quot;And we know that some of his  people are living in Toronto, because they have  demonstrated against the Indian army going into the Golden  Temple in Amritsar  in Toronto and Vancouver. So I am worried that one of them  will send infor­mation about where I am back to the Punjab, and that they will  come after me to kill me here in Delhi.</p>
                      <p>&quot;It all started in 1981 when I  had the misfortune to catch a train from Patiala,  which was my home., to Delhi.  It was to have been a very ordinary trip I can assure you.</p>
                      <p>&quot;I am just an ordinary Punjabi  married man, with three children, in my mid-40s. I have never had bad relations  with Sikhs, and I can't think of any really bad problems between Hindus and  Sikhs in my home state.”</p>
                      <p><strong>Ceremonial dagger</strong></p>
                      <p>“So I had no idea of any trouble  when I got on the train. There was a nihang in my compartment, a man in his 30s  wear­ing the traditional clothes of a Sikh religious warrior. You see them at  the Sikh gurdwaras (temples) which we Hindus often visit to pray at as well as  our own temples.”</p>
                      <p>&quot;They are part of Punjabi  history, you know, and until recently nobody worried about nihangs. So this man  in my com­partment dressed in a blue and white turban, a blue and white  calf-length tunic and wearing a kirpan (ceremonial dagger) represented no  threat to me. I was so wrong.”</p>
                      <p>&quot;Then the ticket collector came  through the train. India  is a poor country and many people try to travel free, so the railway guards are  always checking.... unfortunately for me in this case.</p>
                      <p>&quot;The nihang did not have a  ticket. The ticket collector said that he would have to get off the train if he  didn’t pay. The nihang told him: ‘I have never bought a ticket in my life.  Nihangs do not buy tickets, we are not paying money, we are religious people.’</p>
                      <p>&quot;There was a heated argument.  Now at that stage the terrorism was only just beginning and I did not in any way  associate the nihang with such business. </p>
                      <p>“I made the mistake of trying to  cool things down by pointing out that it was only reasonable that he should pay  because everyone else had to pay, including Hindu priests.­ </p>
                      <p>&quot;The nihang drew his dagger and  started waving it. Still I thought it was just temperament and tried to calm  both sides down. Then he stabbed me in the stomach.&quot;</p>
                      <p>The passengers and guards wrestled  with the Sikh &quot;warrior&quot; and subdued and dragged him off at the, next  station, where police arrested him. Kapoor was rushed to hospital He was in  hospital for 25 days, off work for six weeks.</p>
                      <p>Naturally, he testified at the  nihang's trial for attempted murder. The Sikh &quot;warrior&quot; was sentenced  to two years' imprisonment.</p>
                      <p>But that was not the end of it.</p>
                      <p>&quot;I continued at my job in Patiala. I had medical trouble  of course, but gradually I started to forget the incident, except in my  nightmares.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Meanwhile, terrorism became a  daytime nightmare in my state.</p>
                      <p>&quot;The former chief priest of the  Akal Takht, part of the Golden Temple Amritsar, was assassinated across the  street from that city's police headquarters.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Newspaper editors were killed.  One was killed despite the fact that he had his own armed guards with him and  was accompanied by a jeep full of police. </p>
                      <p>&quot;Terrorists started stopping  buses and killing Hindu men on them. Groups, of policemen were ambushed. Trains  were attacked and government officials were shot.</p>
                      <p>&quot;But I didn't think it had  anything to do with me. I was horrified like every one else in the Punjab and blamed the politicians on both sides for the  mess. The press talked about a reign of terror but in my home everything was  calm as usual.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Then one day I got a letter.  On one side it said, you have worked against the cause of the Sikh Khalsa Panth  (meaning, the Sikh national community) and this will not be good for you. You  will have to pay for your actions, no matter how much you try to hide yourself.</p>
                      <p>&quot;On the back of the letter was  imprinted a, map of Khalistan — the separatists' name for an independent Sikh  state — and the official seal of Khalistan. It was signed by Bhindranwale  himself.</p>
                      <p>&quot;I read this letter with utter  horror, I can assure you, because' I knew what it was. It was a death sentence.  Hundreds of other people had received such letters and had been assassinated  despite the fact that they had armed guards surrounding them.</p>
                      <p>&quot;I had no money to pay for  guards. I had no weapons. I was helpless. If the police could not protect  themselves, how could they protect me?</p>
                      <p><strong>'Abandoned my life'</strong></p>
                      <p>&quot;I got this letter last  October, the same month the central government placed the Punjab  under its direct rule. That meant the Punjabi government had not been able to  deal with Bindranwale's assassins.<br>
                        <br>
  &quot;At first I just stopped going  out to. public places. Then I realized that they knew where I lived and it was  just a matter of time before they came to my home to kill me.</p>
                      <p>&quot;There was only one thing to  do. I abandoned my life in the Punjab and fled to Delhi, where I now hideut under an assumed  name. I don't feel safe here either, because they have assassinated people in  Delhi also.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Now that Bhindranwalele has  been killed and the bulk of his followers are dead, in prison or in hiding, can  I go, back home and see my family?</p>
                      <p>&quot;The unity of India may have  been saved but what about me? It doesn't take an army to kill one small  teacher, just a small group of fanatics. I am a marked man now, condemned to  death by Bhindranwale himself, and those of his followers who survive will  perhaps  think he was a martyr and and  that it is their life's mission to execute people like me.&quot;</p>
                      <p class="headline2">What kind of people executed the  missions of murder?</p>
                      <p>NEW    DELHI — The storming of the Sikh's. holiest shrine, the Golden Temple  and the ensuing crackdown has claimed the lives of nearly 1,000 followers of  the Sikh extremist leader Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. More than 4,000 have  been arrested.</p>
                      <p>Estimates of the number enlisted in  the radical leader's &quot;death squads&quot; range from 15,000 to an extreme  of 60,000. That leaves thousands of angry young men who bathed in Amrtsar 's  &quot;pool of nectar” and took the Bhindranwale oath to kill or die still at  large to carry out their dead leader's mission of murder. </p>
                      <p>What kind of people were the killers  who executed the extremist leaders death warrants?  </p>
                      <p>One magazine published what it said was  an account based on police interrogations of half a dozen killers, but warned readers  that the confessions had been obtained by the police through &quot;third degree&quot;  methods.</p>
                      <p>No common background links them. Some  have little or no education, but, one  was a senior high school graduate. </p>
                      <p>Several had records of petty crime  when they drifted into the orbit of the various factions operating out of the Golden Temple  and some other gurdwaras. </p>
                      <p>They told police that regular confer­ences  were held in which it was decided who should be slain, then they were given hit  lists and sent out to kill the victims.</p>
                      <p>One, Jasbir Singh, known as Pappu, confessed  to an amazing list of killings. He is said to have started off by stealing wire  and iron bars with his friends Beant, Basant and Inder.</p>
                      <p><strong>Killed smoker</strong></p>
                      <p>Then in 1978, his sister told him Beant  and Bassant had &quot;molested&quot; her.</p>
                      <p>Pappu, his brother-in-law and Inder strangled  Beant and dumped his body in a canal. Then they killed Basant with swords and  put him in the canal, too. Over the next four years he confessed to committing  several more murders.</p>
                      <p>He murdered one man in a maize field  with a sword because of an argument and then, on a train, killed a man who was  smoking, which is against the Sikh religion.</p>
                      <p>Last year. Pappu, who was said to be  living in a hostel in the Golden   Temple compound decided  another man Khala Singh, was a &quot;tobacco eater and political informer.&quot;  With two other men he tortured Khala and finally strangled him. The body was  taken out and dumped.</p>
                      <p>Later, Pappu and two other men ant  to a nearby village and attacked some other Sikhs, killing one and wounding four  with home-made pistols.     :<br>
                          <br>
                        Next, he took part in a bank robbery  killing the bank's guard.</p>
                      <p>Last December, a man named Santokh  Singh who had slept with a woman in the temple complex was strangled by a group  of men. Sant Harchand Singh Longowal, the Akali Dal leader now under detention  by the Indian government, is said to have ordered the interrogation of the  suspected group to find out who did it.</p>
                      <p>Pappu and two others were grabbed by  a group of 50 of Longowal’s faction and allegedly tortured. But they insisted  they were innocent of this killing.</p>
                      <p>They were made to tape statements  that they had killed another man. Pappu and his men then fled from the protec­tion  of the sprawling temple complex and were finally arrested by police.</p>
