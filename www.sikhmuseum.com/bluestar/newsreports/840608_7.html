                      By Peter Rickwood </p>
                      <p><span class="fs14italic">Toronto Star<br>
                      June 8, 1984</span><br>
                        <br>
                      Sikhs from across Ontario,  many wearing black armbands in mourning and ceremonial daggers, shouted their  outrage in Toronto  yesterday at the storming of their holiest shrine by the Indian army.</p>
                      <p>The emotional protest by hundreds  of men, women and children in front of the Indian consulate at Yonge and Bloor  Sts. passed without incident on the site where violence had marred a 1982  Sikh demonstration.</p>
                      <p>A large contingent of Metro police  looked on as the angry crowd, carrying placards condemning the attack, chanted  slogans against the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her decision  to send troops into Amritsar's Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>Two uniformed Royal Canadian Mounted  Police officers were on duty outside the 29th-floor consulate offices where a  man went on a rampage the previous day, smashing pictures and overturning  furniture.</p>
                      <p>In November, 1982, two people were  shot, including one plain­clothes policeman, during a similar demonstration.</p>
                      <p>&quot;There will be no violence in Canada,&quot; pledged Gurdep Singh Upnagra,  vice-president of the Federation of Sikh Societies in Canada in an interview as shoppers dodged  demonstrators to get into Hudson's  Bay Centre.</p>
                      <p>But the fall of the sacred temple  and the deaths of hundreds of Sikhs will only reinforce the Sikh resolve to  seek independence, Sunagra said. &quot;We don't want to live with India any more, we want separation, we want our Palestine,&quot; he  declared.</p>
                      <p>In Ottawa,  where a smaller demonstration was held, Dr. Bakhshish Samagh, secretary of the  Sikh federation, said the Gold­en Temple &quot;is like the Vatican for us.</p>
                      <p>&quot;If St. Peter's church in the Vatican is  destroyed today, what will happen with Catholics?&quot; he asked.</p>
                      <p>The Indian army seized control of  the 6 square hectare (15 acre) Golden   Temple complex in Amrit,  sar Wednesday in a battle that claimed more than 300 lives, including that of  Sikh militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. </p>
                      <p>The bullet-riddled body of the  37 year old fundamentalist preacher, the leader of a two year terrorist campaign  for greater Sikh rights that has claimed hundreds of lives, was found in the  temple's throne room.</p>
                      <p>Upnagra said the slain Sikh leader &quot;was  not a political leader, he was a saint. And we will always follow him.&quot;</p>
                      <p>&quot;The Spirit of Martyrs Will  Haunt You Indira&quot;, proclaimed one of the placards carried by demonstrators  in Toronto  yester­day.</p>
                      <p>Gandhi was the target of most of the  hostility and a picture of her was burned at the protest. Individual demonstrators, many of  whom have relatives in Punjab — the Sikh homeland in northern India and centre of the violence said they were  shocked and horrified by the events in Amritsar</p>
