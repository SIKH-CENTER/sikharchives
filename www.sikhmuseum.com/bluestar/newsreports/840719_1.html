                      <p>WINNIPEG (CP) — Sikh demonstrators  who punched the acting Indian High Commissioner to Canada  and pelted him with eggs during a melee yesterday will not be charged, a Winnipeg police spokesman  said.</p>
                      <p>The Sikhs set upon Kalarickal  Pranchu Fabian as RCMP officers in charge of security tried to escort him from  a downtown garage to a waiting car.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Kill that —,&quot; screamed  one demonstrator as he rushed with about 30 others past city and RCMP  plainclothes officers.</p>
                      <p>The Winnipeg police official said he had no  reports of any violence that would call for charges to be laid. An RCMP  official in Winnipeg  said charges would be the responsibility of city police.</p>
                      <p>When Mr. Fabian got free of the  crowd, he went by car to a private lunch at the University of Manitoba.  Professors who lunched with him said he was not hurt, and even joked about the  incident.</p>
                      <p>At the time, however, Mr. Fabian  appeared shaken and his face was splattered with broken eggs from the attack in  a parking lot behind the Winnipeg Free Press building. Mr. Fabian was at the  Free Press for an interview.</p>
                      <p>Glenn Olsen, a Winnipeg Free Press  photographer, was knocked to his knees by a wayward blow from a policeman's  walkie-talkie during the incident and was taken to hospital. He was later  released. </p>
                      <p>Police decided to take Mr. Fabian  out by a back door of the news­paper's truck maintenance garage after  demonstrators surrounded the building.</p>
                      <p>As the slightly built Indian Government  official emerged into the parking lot, however, the angry Sikhs surged past  police, screaming and pounding the waiting car with their fists and with long  sticks. Several of them carried egg cartons and at least three eggs were  smashed into the official's face. </p>
                      <p>After Mr. Fabian was pushed by  police into the car, a demonstrator jumped on the hood and was carried for  about 10 metres before falling off, apparently uninjured. </p>
                      <p>There were no demonstrators or incidents  at the university, where Mr. Fabian had lunch with the members of the  Indo-Canadian Institute.</p>
