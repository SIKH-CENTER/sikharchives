                      July 6, 1984</p>
                      <p>ISLAMABAD (AP) — Sikh hijackers  forced an Indian Airlines plane to Lahore,   Pakistan,  yesterday and threatened to blow it up with 264 people aboard if their demands  were not met, a Government spokesman said.</p>
                      <p>The Sikhs, who seized the twin  engined jetliner on a domestic flight from Srinagar,  capital of Kashmir, to New Delhi, demanded  immediate release of all Sikhs arrested during recent agitation by that sect  in India's Punjab  state. </p>
                      <p>The spokesman said the hijackers  set a deadline of 2 a.m. yesterday (5 p.m. EDT), but the dealine passed  without incident.</p>
                      <p>The ultimatum was conveyed to  authorities in New Delhi, said Mohammed Sharif,  deputy information officer for the military Government in Pakistan.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Sharif said he had no word on  those held hostage on the plane, which remains under heavy security at Lahore Airport,  280 kilometres east of Islamabad.  The hijacked plane carried 255 passengers, including the hijackers, and nine  crew.</p>
                      <p>He said that Pakistan was awaiting word from New Delhi on how to  proceed.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Sharif said there were four  hijackers aboard the aircraft. Earlier, in New Delhi,  the United News of India agency said nine Sikh militants had pirated the  Airbus A-300 and said they belonged to the Kashmir  unit of the banned All-India Sikh Students Federation. The Indian Government  has accused the federation of plotting for secession and setting up guerrilla  training camps in Kashmir.</p>
                      <p>Other hijacker demands were:<br>
                        — That India announce over radio and  television the names of all those arrested in the Sikh crackdown.<br>
                        — That India release Harmandar Singh  Sandho, General Secretary of the All-India Sikh Students Federation, and 29  other prominent members.<br>
                        — That India  convert into U.S. dollars the $25-million in money and treasure that Sikhs say  was looted by Indian soldiers from the Golden  Temple in Amritsar  last month, and send the money on to Pakistan. </p>
                      <p>Last month, Indian soldiers stormed  the Golden Temple,  the most sacred Sikh shrine, to root out extremists agitating for an independent  Sikh state in Punjab.</p>
                      <p>State run Pakistan Television quoted  the hijackers as saying &quot;We are prepared to kill or get killed&quot; when  they talked to airport authorities.</p>
