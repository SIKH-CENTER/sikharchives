                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      June 21, 1984</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840621_1a.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="402" class="pictureright1">NEW DELHI (Reuter) — The Indian Army arrested  156 more Sikhs in Punjab state yesterday, raising the toll to 4,200 since the  assault on the Golden Temple in the holy city of Amritsar two weeks ago.</p>
                      <p>Prime Minister Indira Gandhi  declared, meanwhile, that her troops would remain in the temple until all arms  there were removed.</p>
                      <p>Maj. Gen. R. K. Gaur, spokesman for  the army operation in Punjab, said interrogation  of about half the 4,200 arrested had ended and those found not guilty would be  released soon.</p>
                      <p>The roundup was part of a hunt for  about 100 extremists still at large after troops stormed the temple two weeks  ago.</p>
                      <p>The Press Trust of India news agency  quoted Mrs Gandhi as telling a delegation from a citizen's welfare group that  reconciliation, not blame, is needed.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Everyone should feel he is in  the national mainstream,&quot; PTI quoted Mrs. Gandhi. However, she dismissed  speculation about a quick withdrawal of troops from Amritsar's  Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine. The  army could leave only when weapons there had been found and removed, she said.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. Gandhi ordered the army into Punjab state on June 2. Nearly 1,000 people were killed  when security forces stormed the temple complex four days later.</p>
                      <p>Security forces recovered large  quantities of arms and ammunition, including light machineguns and grenades.</p>
                      <p>PTI said the Indian Supreme Court  yesterday directed two of its officials to meet detained Sikh leader Harchand  Singh Longowal, head of the Sikhs' Akali Dal political party.</p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, an External Affairs  Ministry spokesman said the government had terminated the services of India's charge d'affaires in Oslo,  Harinder Singh, who told reporters on Tuesday that he was resigning to protest  against the attack on the Golden   Temple</p>
