                      June 12, 1984</p>
                      <p>AMRITSAR, India (AP) — The death toll  in last week's attack on the Golden Temple complex could be as high as 2,000  because many people are unaccounted for and more bodies are being pulled from  the holy lake surrounding the shrine, officials say.</p>
                      <p>Authorities have already cremated  the bodies of 825 Sikh militants killed in last week's two day assault on the  sprawling seventeenth century temple complex, said police and civilian  officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified.</p>
                      <p>A garbage truck carrying 38 bo­dies  was seen in Amritsar  on Sunday night.</p>
                      <p>Officially, the army has reported  that as many as 400 Sikh extremists died in the temple siege. Maj.-Gen. R. K.  Gaur said yesterday that 90 soldiers had been killed.</p>
                      <p>But sources here said the conservative  estimate is at least 1,000 deaths, including 200 troops. And they said the  figure could reach 2,000 once the tally is complete. </p>
                      <p>Most died on Tuesday and Wednesday  when 3,000 troops backed by tanks and rockets attacked the fortified compound  to flush out Sikh. extremists blamed for more than 400 murders this year.</p>
                      <p>Waves of commandos, including  frogmen assigned to dive in the temple lake, were sent into the compound first  but all were killed, military and police sources said. It took three charges  before the troops actually entered the temple grounds, they said.</p>
                      <p>Many surviving troops have had limbs  amputated because they were wounded by mines and militants firing from  manholes, they said.</p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, hundreds of outraged Sikh  soldiers deserted in eastern and western India  to protest against the assault on the Golden Temple.  Reports indicated 26 extremists were killed and 355 arrested yesterday as  they headed for Amritsar and three soldiers died  in a clash with mutinous Sikh troops in southwestern India.</p>
                      <p>The Press Trust of India said the  extremists were slain when government troops tried to halt 48 army and  civilian vehicles heading to Amtrisar from the eastern city of Ramgarh.</p>
                      <p>The agency reported that nine  truckloads of well-armed Sikh extremists crossed from Maharashtra into neighboring  Gujarat state Monday. It said some of the  Sikhs later surrendered but did not say if any soldiers were among the extremists.</p>
                      <p>In London, thousands of Sikhs rallied and burned  effigies of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, shouting &quot;Gandhi will pay&quot;  for the assault. Officials said more than 20,000 demonstrators marched on the  Indian High Commission but were turned away by hundreds of police.<br>
                          <br>
                        In Amritsar, Indian President Zail Singh, a  Sikh, wept when he toured the temple complex on Friday and saw the devastated buildings and grounds littered with corpses,  witnesses said.</p>
                      <p>More paramilitary troops are being  deployed in Amritsar  where the situation remains tense. Explosions and gunfire were heard from the  temple complex yesterday morning.</p>
                      <p>Police sources said at least seven  people have died of starvation in Amritsar,  which has been curfew bound since June 3. Many more are sick from drinking  contaminated water. Water and power to the central area was still cut off  yesterday.</p>
                      <p>All letters from soldiers are being  read and any mention of army casualties censored by officers. A roll of film  taken by an Associated Press reporter in Amritsar  was confiscated yesterday by army officials.</p>
                      <p>In the military's continuing operation  to flush out Sikh terrorists and their arms caches, 15 suspected extremists  have been killed since Sunday night in Faridkot and Ferozepur, six in Bhatinda  and three in Amritsar  district, the officials said. </p>
                      <p>Sikh extremists have killed 32  Hindus in six separate attacks across the state since Saturday, they said.</p>
                      <p>At least six armored personnel  carriers and two tanks were spotted Monday on the highway from Amritsar  to Jullundur city in central Punjab.</p>
                      <p>In Jullundur,  about 2,500 Sikhs, including women and children, demonstrated against the army  invasion of the Golden   Temple.</p>
                      <p>&quot;We will face bullets. We will  fight for Khalistan,&quot; they chanted, referring to the name proposed for an  independent Sikh nation.</p>
