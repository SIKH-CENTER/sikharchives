                      <p class="fs14italic">Toronto Star<br>
                      June 7, 1984</p>
                      <p>AMRITSAR (Reuter) — Jarnail Singh  Bhindranwale, the fiery Sikh preacher, died as he lived — in violence.</p>
                      <p>His bullet riddled body and those of  two close aides were found this morning in the basement of the Akal Takht, his  headquarters inside the Golden   Temple complex where at  least 300 people were killed in hand-to-hand combat between Sikh extremists  and army troops.</p>
                      <p>In what was probably his final  interview last Sunday, Bhindran­wale, 37, told Reuters: &quot;We may be killed.  But a Sikh never weeps. He will laugh or smile in whatever condition he is  in.&quot;</p>
                      <p>As he spoke from the Akal Takht,  seat of the highest Sikh order, Indian troops were crouch­ed by sandbags  outside the walled temple complex.</p>
                      <p>Dressed in a traditional loose .  white gown, a .45 calibre pistol beside him, Bhindranwale sat on a mattress  spread on the floor with his back to a wall as teen­aged bodyguards carrying  sub­machineguns milled around him. </p>
                      <p>Bhindranwale was born in the western  Punjab village of   Rode in 1947.</p>
                      <p>He came to be regarded as a messiah  by many Sikhs in 1978 when he vowed to avenge the deaths of several of his  followers in a clash between them and members of a breakaway Sikh sect called  Nirankaris.  </p>
                      <p>Bhindranwale, called a saint by his  disciples, preached fundamen­talism and until the end opposed the moderate wing  of the Sikhs' main party, the Akali Dal. </p>
                      <p>&quot;All men are born Sikhs, it is  only the scissors which disfigure the others,&quot; he once said. Sikhs are  forbidden by their religion from cutting their hair.</p>
                      <p>Indian political analysts said  Bhindranwale was likely to be more of a force in death than is life. &quot;His  martyrdom is certain to attract more Sikhs to the cause,&quot; one of them  said.</p>
                      <p>Many of Bhindraswale's sup­porters  advocated creation of a separate Sikh state, to be called Khalistan, through  violence.</p>
