                      June 11, 1984</p>
                      <p>NEW    DELHI, India (UPI) — Sikh sol­diers in the Indian army rebelled  in three places yesterday and killed their commanding officer in one instance,  officials said.</p>
                      <p>At least three people were killed in  the widely scattered mutinies sparked by an army assault last week on the  holiest shrine of the Sikh religion, the Golden  Temple in the Punjab city of Amritsar. More than 450  people were killed in the attack ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.</p>
                      <p>Troops of the Sikh regimental centre  at Ramgarh camp in Bihar state, 804 km (about 500 miles) east of New Delhi, murdered  their commander, Brig. Gen. R.S. Puri, a defence ministry spokesman said. </p>
                      <p>Two other senior officers and a number  of soldiers were seriously wounded in heavy shooting at the camp that began  before noon and continued until 4 p.m. </p>
                      <p>Police said the soldiers joined  other angry Sikhs in hijacking private buses and trucks at gunpoint. They set  out in at least 35 seized vehicles toward New    Delhi before reinforcements from the 24th mountain  regiment arrived to stop them.</p>
                      <p>Sikh soldiers remaining behind at  the camp raised a white flag of surrender when the reinforcements arrived. </p>
                      <p>Soldiers, believed to be Sikhs, also  rebelled near Pune, 1,448 km (about 900 miles) southwest of New Delhi, the Press Trust of India reported.</p>
                      <p>Police said soldiers travelling in  three military vehicles fired at passing cars and trucks, killing at least one  person and injuring another.</p>
                      <p>The newspaper, Indian Express,  carried details of a third mutiny that had been categorically denied by an  official government spokesman.</p>
                      <p>It quoted eyewitnesses saying Sikh  mutineers in Sri Ganganagar district, 643 km (400 miles) west of New Delhi, seized nine jeeps  and four trucks on Friday. The troops killed one policeman and wounded another  on their way toward the border with Punjab  about 30 miles away.</p>
                      <p>Sikh soldiers make up about 10% of  the Indian army and hold many of the top ranks</p>
