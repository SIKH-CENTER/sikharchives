                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      June 18, 1984</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840618_4a.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="600" class="pictureright1">OTTAWA (CP) — A demonstration by  about 250 Sikhs on Parliament Hill yesterday afternoon was told that the views  of new Liberal Leader John Turner are &quot;very sensitive to the Sikhs.&quot;</p>
                      <p>R. S. Chahal, a Calgary  delegate to the weekend Liberal leadership convention, told the crowd of Sikhs  from Ottawa, Montreal  and Kingston,  that he spoke to Mr. Turner on Saturday and &quot;hopefully we will see from  the Canadian Government very favorable action.&quot;</p>
                      <p>The demonstration denounced Indian  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her Government for the attack by the Indian  army on the Sikh Golden Temple in the Punjab region of India, which left  hundreds dead nearly two weeks ago. </p>
                      <p>Men, women and children marched  together chanting slogans against the Indian Government and hoisted placards  saying &quot;Indira's democracy drips with blood&quot; and &quot;Death to  Indira dynasty.&quot;</p>
                      <p>The Ottawa Sikh Society, in a letter  to the Indian High Commission, is urging the Indian Government to cease all  military actions against Sikhs, release all prisoners captured, and show  empathy toward Sikh soldiers who deserted. </p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, in Winnipeg  on Saturday, more than 600 men, women and children from the Sikh community marched  through the city's downtown to protest against the recent killing of hundreds  of their fellow Sikhs in India.</p>
                      <p>As curious bystanders looked on,  demonstrators quietly filed past, carrying signs and banners denouncing Mrs.  Gandhi and calling for independence for the Punjab.</p>
                      <p>Escorted by police on motorcycles,  the peaceful demonstration followed on the heels of a similar protest a week  ago at the Manitoba Legislature.</p>
                      <p>Last week's protest took place  during a peace march organized by nuclear disarmament groups. It sparked  concern because an effigy of Mrs. Gandhi was burned without a fire permit and a  number of demonstrators carried swords. </p>
                      <p>While an effigy of Mrs. Gandhi was  beaten with sticks, nothing was burned at Saturday's march and only five holy  men, dressed in loose fitting blue costumes and black turbans, carried  sheathed, ceremonial swords.</p>
                      <p>Organizer Kuldip Singh said the  purpose of Saturday's demonstration was to make Canadians aware of what was  taking place in India  and to call on the Canadian Government to send a fact finding mission to  examine the circumstances surrounding the attack on the Sikh temple.</p>
                      <p>The Sikhs, a religious minority in India, are seeking to set up an independent  state in the Punjab.</p>
