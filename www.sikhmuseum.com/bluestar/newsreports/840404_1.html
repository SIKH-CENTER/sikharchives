                      <p>By WILLIAM STEVENS</p>
                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      April 4, 1984</p>
                      <p>New York Times Service<br>
                        AMRITSAR, India — There have never been more than  about 500 of them, the authorities say. Most are in their late teens or early  20s. Most are religious mili­tants. Some are ordinary crimi­nals who have  simply seized an opportunity. A few are old-line Maoist revolutionaries whose  main movement in India  was crushed more than a decade ago. </p>
                      <p>But as compact as it is, this tiny  band of Sikh terrorists has sown such fear and caused such insta­bility in the  state of Punjab in the past six weeks that it threatens to halt or even reverse  the economic progress that has made Punjab a model of Third   World industrial development.<br>
                        policemen, editors, Hindu leaders,  even other Sikhs, and shoot them. Then they fade away into the vil­lages and  towns, finding sanctu­ary in one of the hundreds of Sikh temples that dot the  flat, green Punjabi landscape.</p>
                      <p>Operating typically in pairs on  motorcycles at night, the terror­ists seek out Government officials, The  Government does not follow them into the temples for fear of outraging the  religious sensibili­ties of Sikhs at large. Few villag­ers have dared to turn  them in. To some Sikh farmers they have become legend: holy warriors, divinely  protected from capture, fighting for a centuries-old vision of Sikh identity,  integrity and independence.</p>
                      <p>At the same time, many more of India's 14 million Sikhs worry about the damage  that the terror­ist campaign may be doing to their standing with the Hindu  majority, and to their reputation as India's most enterprising group.</p>
                      <p>&quot;The Sikhs are feeling damned  hurt,&quot; said Bhagwant Singh Ahu­ja, an Amritsar textile manufac­turer and a Sikh,  &quot;because the majority community is condemn­ing all the Sikhs. But it's  just a handful of people creating the situ­ation.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Many Sikhs say they are fed up with  it all, and in the past two weeks the Government has cracked down on the  terrorists again. It has outlawed a Sikh stu­dent organization believed to be  behind much of the terrorism, arresting many of its members and driving others  underground. But despite Government assur­ances that the situation is being  brought under control, the killings continue.</p>
                      <p>More than 100 people have been  killed since the terror reached a peak in mid-February, and more than 300 since  1982.</p>
                      <p>As the seat of India's Green Revolution, Punjab  has become this country's great economic success story. The Green Revolu­tion,  carried out almost exclusive­ly by Sikh farmers, made the state India's  wealthiest, and at the same time its main granary. There is little sign that  this agri­cultural success is about to be undone.</p>
                      <p>However, Punjab's  agricultural­ly induced prosperity has made it an increasingly commercial and  industrial state as well, and it is this second stage of development that is  being threatened by the violence.</p>
                      <p>The state's economy is estimat­ed to  have lost $1.2-billion in the fiscal year that ended March 31 as a result of  the state's instability. More fundamentally, however, the terror is choking off  the flow of outside capital on which Punjabi industrial development depends.  Hindu entrepreneurs, afraid of becoming targets, are fleeing the state. The  development of a high-technology industrial park 40 kilo­metres from Amritsar has been stopped.</p>
                      <p>&quot;It is the beginning of the  disin­tegration of Punjab's economy,&quot;  columnist Prom Shankar Jha wrote in The Times of India re­cently.</p>
                      <p>There is a deep irony in this,  because one of the grievances underlying the agitation involves Sikh fears that  Punjabi economic growth is being hobbled by Gov­ernment policy.</p>
                      <p>Many Sikhs believe the Govern­ment  is discriminating against them economically by manipulat­ing wheat prices and  discouraging the establishment of new industry in Punjab  so that poorer areas of the country can have it.</p>
                      <p>Some Sikhs are particularly bitter  because of their belief that the Government-owned banks in<br>
                        Punjab are investing Punjabis' savings in  industry elsewhere in the country.</p>
                      <p>&quot;That's the sweat of the soil  they're sending out of the state,&quot; Mr. Ahuja said.</p>
                      <p>All of this has been overshad­owed  by the terrorist activity. So have the original demands for greater Punjabi  political autono­my that set off the agitation by the Akali Dal, an  out-of-power Sikh political party, in August, 1982.</p>
                      <p>The Sikh movement, which orig­inally  used Gandhian tactics of non-violence, was gradually usurped by the more  radical ele­ments identified with Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a fundamen­talist  Sikh holy man who preached violence from his sanctuary in Amritsar's  Golden Temple. Asso­ciated with Mr.  Bhindranwale is the banned All-India Sikh Students Federation.</p>
