                      <p>LONDON — More than 20,000 Sikhs from all  over England and Scotland converged on central London  yesterday in a massive display of anger at the Indian Army's storming of their  holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar.</p>
                      <p>The demonstrators, their five  turbaned lead­ers brandishing ceremonial swords, marched through the streets to  chants of &quot;death to Indira Gandhi&quot; and &quot;blood for blood.&quot;  The protest, largest ever organized by Sikhs in Britain, was peaceful but tense  and there were clear signs that the assault on the Golden Temple and the death  of the fundamentalist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, had unleashed a new  mood of militancy in the Sikh community, largest outside India.</p>
                      <p>Until last week, there was little  support in Britain for Sikh  separatists who want to transform Punjab into  an independent state to be called Khalistan. But at yesterday's demonstration,  thousands of people carried bright orange banners and wore orange ribbons to  symbolize their support.</p>
                      <p>Beant Singh, general secretary of  the biggest Sikh temple in the West, the Siri Gurusingh Sabha, summed up their  feelings like this: &quot;We have no future in India. There is no alternative now  but to form a separate state.&quot; Another Sikh spokesman said: &quot;We were  all moderate. But all that has changed. We'll make sure that Mrs. Gandhi pays  for what she's done, sooner or lat­er.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Yesterday's demonstration was the  climax of several days of sometimes violent protest. Indian banks and  diplomatic offices in four cities, including London,  had been fire-bombed and furious Sikhs had tried to set fire to Hindu temples  in the London  suburb of Southall where, until now, Sikhs and Hindus had lived peacefully side  by side.</p>
                      <p>So there was a heavy police presence  along the route of the march and exceptional measures had been taken to  protect the Indian High Commission. When the demonstrators approached the  building, they found access blocked by six rows of steel barricades and several  lines of policemen.</p>
                      <p>Tempers flared as the High  Commission loomed into sight. The chanting of the demonstrators rose to a high  pitch. They waved their fists at the empty building and an effigy of Indira  Gandhi was ceremonially burned.</p>
                      <p>But there was none of the violence  police had anticipated, though six arrests were made. However, Indian officials in Britain, many of  whom are now under police protection, are concerned that there may be worse to  come. It seems they may have reason. A new focus of Sikh resistance to the  Indian Government sprang up over the weekend with the establishment in London of a Sikh  government-in-exile. Its base is a modest suburban house and its self-styled  president Dr. Jagjit Singh Chohan, a former deputy speaker of the Punjab State  Assembly. His followers have threatened to exact revenge for the desecration  of the Golden Temple and the deaths of hundreds of  Sikh militants at the hands of the Indian Army.</p>
                      <p>&quot;The martyrdom of our brothers  cannot go forgotten,&quot; he said.</p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, extremist Sikh youth  organizations in Britain  are reported to be circulating &quot;hit lists&quot; of people they describe as  agents of Indira Gandhi.</p>
                      <p>They have also vowed to carry out  attacks on Indian airline offices and diplomatic premises throughout the  country.</p>
                      <p>Beant Singh warned yesterday against  dismissing these as empty threats.</p>
                      <p>&quot;I think it is very likely  there is a hit list. We Sikhs are a non-violent people. We have been protesting  in non-violent ways for 30 years. But now Indira has killed our people and it  has turned into a violent fight. There is no other way left.&quot;</p>
                      <p>There are signs, too, that extremist  Sikhs in Britain  may have even more prestigious targets in their sights. A Sikh businessman in London is rumored to have  put a price of $75,000 on the heads of Mrs. Gandhi and her son, Rajiv. Sikh  sources say the reward will be paid to whoever delivers her and her son to Amritsar's Golden   Temple — dead or alive.</p>
