                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      June 13, 1984</p>
                      <p>From Reuter and Associated Press</p>
                      <p>BOMBAY — Any of the Sikh troops who  mutinied because of the army's storming of the Golden Temple  in Amritsar  will be hanged if found guilty, a top Indian general told a news conference  yesterday.</p>
                      <p>Lt.-Gen. T. S. Oberoi, chief of  southern command, said the army took a dim view of the mutiny.</p>
                      <p>&quot;The mutineers will be tried  and, if found guilty, will be hanged. No one dares revolt in the Indian  Army,&quot; he said.</p>
                      <p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman  said the mutiny has been quelled, and that there were no new desertions  yesterday.</p>
                      <p>The United News of India news agency  said about 1,200 Sikh deserters from Bihar state have surrendered in  neighboring Uttar Pradesh state and given up their efforts to reach Punjab. UNI said all major groups of deserters have been  accounted for, although a few smaller groups are still at large.</p>
                      <p>Military sources said at least 2,000  Sikh soldiers deserted their army bases in eastern, northern and western India last weekend and headed for Punjab state  and New Delhi  to protest against the army attack on the seventeenth century shrine.</p>
                      <p>At least 46 deserters were killed in  gun battles with military and police pursuers, 600 were arrested and most of  the others surrendered, said the sources, who spoke on condition they not be  identified.</p>
                      <p>Thirteen rebel Sikh soldiers were  reported killed and 33 seriously wounded in a pitched battle yesterday with  loyal troops in Agartala, in the northeastern state of Tripura.</p>
                      <p>Rebel soldiers captured near Bombay disclosed they had  planned to take over the airport in the western port city, prompting Indian  Airlines to alert all stations against possible hijack attempts.</p>
                      <p>In Amritsar, soldiers were reported still  removing bodies from the temple grounds and cremating them in mass funeral  pyres. Sources said the death toll from last week's battle at the Golden Temple  compound has risen to 1,220 and is likely to reach 1,300.</p>
                      <p>Sikhs in Toronto  said they had talked to relatives in the Punjab  who told them true toll is closer to 3,600. The Canadian Sikhs, who spoke on  condition they not be identified, said they were told that hundreds of Sikh  troops were mowed down when they were forced at gunpoint to lead the assault on  the Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>Military sources in India  said the desertion of 2,000 troops should not be regarded as a widespread  insurrection. Sikh soldiers represent about 10 per cent of the 1.2 million man  Indian Army, the world's fourth largest.</p>
                      <p>The army was reported intensifying  efforts to capture suspected Sikh terrorists throughout Punjab.  Soldiers have arrested more than 6,500 suspected extremists in raids on  villages since Monday, the sources said.</p>
                      <p>The Government also arrested, two  moderate leaders of the Sikh Akali Dal party yesterday. The two Sikhs, Prakash  Singh Badal and Surjit Singh Barnala, had previously advocated unity between  Sikhs and Hindus but refused to call for communal harmony after the army  assault on the Golden Temple. Sikhs are the majority in Punjab,  but most Indians are Hindus.</p>
                      <p>Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,  addressing troops at Srinagar in Kashmir state,  said unidentified foreign countries were trying to destabilize India and  soldiers should be ready to defend the country's borders.</p>
                      <p>&quot;The country today is faced  with its greatest threat ever,&quot; she said. &quot;Whatever has happened in Punjab should not be celebrated as a victory.</p>
