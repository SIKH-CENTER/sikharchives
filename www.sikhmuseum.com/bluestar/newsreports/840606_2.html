                      <p class="headline1">There's a  time for fighting Sikh guru said 300 years ago</p>
                      <p class="fs14italic">Toronto Star<br>
                        June 6, 1984</p>
                      <p>NEW    DELHI (Reuter) — &quot;When all avenues have been explored, all means tried,  it is right­ful to draw the sword out of the scabbard and wield it,&quot; wrote  Gobind Singh, the last of the Sikh gurus some 300 years ago.</p>
                      <p>He organized a militant group called  &quot;Khalsa,&quot; meaning &quot;pure&quot; in Persian, to fight Mughal  persecution. Since then a small group of extremist Sikhs have dreamed of  forming their own separate Khalistan state.</p>
                      <p>Founded in the 15th century by the  first guru Nanak, the Sikhs were peaceful people until their transformation  into a martial race by Gobind Singh.</p>
                      <p>The sectarian violence that has seen  the deaths of about 400 people during the past six months in the Punjab, the northern Indian state where the Sikhs are  campaigning for greater religious concessions and political autonomy, are only  the latest examples of their militancy.</p>
                      <p>The Sikhs comprise only about 2 per  cent of India's  700 million population but their influence in the army, in commerce and in  agriculture is deeply felt.</p>
                      <p>They said Prime Minister Indira  Gandhi could not afford concessions that might be seen by her majority Hindu  constituents as a re­treat. Neither could the leadership of the main Sikh  political party Akali Dal — under pressure from more extremist elements — tone  down its demands.</p>
                      <p>Akali Dal president Harchand Singh  Longowal, said to be a moderate, launched what he called his Dharam Yudh (holy  war) in August, 1982, to save Punjab and the  Sikhs from what he called the &quot;unholy designs  of the Delhi  trading rulers.&quot;</p>
                      <p>His demands include control of all  historic Sikh temples in India,  the incorporation into Punjab of Punjabi-speaking villages in neighboring  states and the integration of the separately administered Punjab capital of Chandigarh into the  state.</p>
                      <p>But supporters of hardline preacher  Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who set up his headquar­ters at the Golden Temple  at Amritsar the  Sikhs' holiest shrine, say the Akali Dal demands are too weak.</p>
