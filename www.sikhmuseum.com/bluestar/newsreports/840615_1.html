                      <p>AMRITSAR, India — Soldiers combing the Golden  Temple of Amritsar have recovered huge quantities of heroin and other drugs that  Sikh separatists were selling to earn money for sophisticated weapons,  All India Radio reported yesterday.</p>
                      <p>The Government controlled radio,  quoting official sources, said the heroin and hashish were smuggled in from  neighboring Pakistan,  stored and distributed from the temple.</p>
                      <p>Army officers in Amritsar  also told foreign journalists yesterday they had recovered $300,000 worth of  gold, silver and precious gems from the Golden Temple,  the shrine that served as a base for Sikh extremists until army troops backed  by tanks stormed it last week.</p>
                      <p>The army says 492 Sikh extremists  and 84 soldiers were killed in the assault, and 86 extremists and 262 soldiers  wounded. Independent reports have put the death toll at more than 1,000 Sikhs  and 200 soldiers.</p>
                      <p>About 100 Indian journalists and six  Western reporters were flown to Amritsar from New Delhi yesterday for a military briefing and a  carefully controlled one hour tour of the Golden Temple,  the first such tour since the battle.</p>
                      <p>Reporters found the seventeenth century  gold domed temple intact except for a few bullet holes and broken windows, but  the sacred building where the holy scriptures are kept was in shambles.</p>
                      <p>Troops had hoped to avoid firing at  the Akal Takht, the ancient seat of Sikh gurus, but eventually they used a  howitzer to blast the dome of the building, said Maj. Gen. K. S. Brar. A tank  also fired on the building.</p>
                      <p>About 50 soldiers were killed and  200 wounded by machine gun fire raking the exposed esplanade — the  &quot;killing ground,&quot; as military officals called it — in front the Akal  Takht.</p>
                      <p>&quot;What we did not know was how  well the extremists were armed, or how elaborate their defences were,&quot;  said Lt. Gen. Brar, the Sikh officer in charge of the assault. </p>
                      <p>Sikhs fired from manholes, staircases  and basements and from slits in windows and doors that they had bricked up.  Some of the commando units leading the assault took 30 per cent casualties,  General Brar said. </p>
                      <p>Collapsed pillars lay in a heap, and  gaping holes were shot through the dome. The blue mosaic facade of the Akal  Takht was shattered. On the second floor, one still smoldering room was ankle  deep in spent machine gun cartridges.</p>
                      <p>But the Kotha Sahib, a tiny room  where the Sikh holy scriptures are kept at night, is intact.</p>
                      <p>Other buildings were less damaged,  but scarred by deep bullet holes.</p>
                      <p>Reporters were not taken inside the  basement bunker where Mr. Bhindranwale and his top lieutenants reportedly were  found dead. </p>
                      <p>Lt.. Gen. K. Sunderji said it was  &quot;most unlikely&quot; that Mr. Bhindranwale, the leader of the Sikh militants,  had committed suicide. He suffered a large wound on the right side of his head  that could have been caused by a machine gun bullet, a chunk of falling  concrete or a soft nosed bullet fired at close range, he said.</p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, authorities agreed to  issue curfew passes to newspaper staff members and distributors, allowing  newspapers in Punjab to resume publication  today after an 11 day blackout.</p>
                      <p>Security forces said yesterday that  about 90 people had been arrested in Punjab  in the previous 24 hours.</p>
                      <p>Military sources said 50 soldiers  belonging to the Sikh Light Infantry division in Amritsar district refused to obey orders  yesterday.</p>
