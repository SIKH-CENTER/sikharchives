                      June 11, 1984</p>
                      <p>By ANN SILVERSIDES</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840611_4a.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="600" class="pictureright1">At demonstrations in three Canadian  cities over the weekend, about 25,000 Sikhs vowed to avenge the Indian Army's  attack on their Golden   Temple in Northern India  and predicted that an independent Sikh state is inevitable.</p>
                      <p>Effigies of Indian Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi were stabbed and burned at protests in Van­couver, Toronto and  Winnipeg, with placard carrying demonstrators chanting, &quot;Khalistan,&quot;  the name proposed by Sikh militants for an independent nation. </p>
                      <p>Sikh spokesmen urged the Canadian  Government to send a fact finding committee to Punjab, the Northern Indian  state that is predominantly Sikh, to &quot;verify the massacre&quot; that they  say has not been reported accurately. </p>
                      <p>In Toronto yesterday, Gurnam Singh  Kundhal told a crowd of about 4,500 Sikhs, who paraded in an orderly fashion  down University Avenue and converged on City Hall about 1 p.m., that Canada  should also cut off all financial aid to India because the money &quot;is used  to buy arms to kill Sikhs.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, about. 8,000 Sikhs, many  carrying ceremonial swords and daggers, marched peacefully yesterday afternoon  from the downtown Vancouver   Art Gallery  to the Indian consulate. By the time they reached the consulate, their numbers  had grown to 15,000, police said.</p>
                      <p>Another 300 Sikh demonstrators  burned an Indian flag on the steps of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg on Saturday.</p>
                      <p>On Friday, about 2,500 Sikhs, many  of them wearing black arm bands, marched through downtown Calgary in the rain.</p>
                      <p>The Golden  Temple &quot;is as holy to us as the Vatican in Rome  or Mecca are to  the Catholics or Moslems,&quot; said Uhanwant Mundae of the Calgary Sikh  Society. &quot;We cannot tolerate its desecration.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Sikhs across the country, who have  been violently torn apart by internal disagreements in the past, were  galvanized into united action when the Indian Army, with tanks and heavy  artillery, stormed the Golden Temple in Punjab's capital of Amritsar last Wednesday. </p>
                      <p>About 1,000 extremist Sikhs, led by  Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, had taken refuge in the temple, which is located on  a 70 acre site According to police and army reports, about 800 militants,  including Mr. Bhindranwale, were killed in the confrontation.</p>
                      <p>Many demonstrators carried pictures  of Mr. Bhindranwale, who was considered an extremist while alive but has become  widely reguarded as a martyr in death. </p>
                      <p>Several hundred Moslems joined the Toronto demonstration, and  speakers — who, with the exception of Mr. Kundhal, spoke only in Punjabi —  urged Moslem and Sikh solidarity against &quot;Hindu aggression.&quot; </p>
                      <p>Manjit Singh, former president of,  the Sikh Students Federation of India and recently returned from Punjab, told  the crowd that Hindus have &quot;insulted holy places all over India and some  extremist Hindus, have tried to attack (Sikh) temples in Toronto...</p>
                      <p>&quot;The people she (Mrs. Gandhi).  has killed will remain alive all over Punjab.  They can kill the body, but they can't kill us politically... She has used the  people against the people and India  is not a democratic country any more. . . . We will flow the river of  blood.&quot; (Mr.  Singh's speech was  translated for some reporters.)</p>
                      <p>Two Sikhs, who did not want to be  identified, approached a reporter to say that while the Sikh community abhorred  the attack on the temple not everyone agreed that violent separation from India was the  answer. &quot;For now, however, we must all be together.&quot;</p>
                      <p>The Toronto demonstration ended shortly after 2  p.m.</p>
