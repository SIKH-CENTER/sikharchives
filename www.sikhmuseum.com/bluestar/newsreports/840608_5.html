                      June 8,  1984</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840608_5a.jpg" alt="" width="493" height="700" class="pictureright1">NEW DELHI (UPI-Reuter) —Sikh militants struck back yesterday against  an army campaign against their bases in the northern state of Punjab,  killing at least 10 more people. </p>
                      <p>That brings  to 47 the number of dead in rioting sparked by the murderous shoot-out at Amritsar's Golden   Temple complex. Countless  hundreds have been injured in a wave of protests across the country, the Press  Trust of India news agency said.</p>
                      <p>Among the  victims were at least 14 people shot by police. The discovery of the  bullet-riddled body of hardline Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale in the  basement of the temple building provoked clashes in several areas, including Srinagar in Kashmir, Patna,  Lucknow, Madras, Bombay and Simla.</p>
                      <p>Here in the  Indian capital of New Delhi, 400 kilometres (250  miles) south of Amritsar,  police shot dead two Sikh youths during a day of running battles with  demonstrators hurling rocks and bottles, police said. More than 100 people,  including 65 policemen, were injured in street battles. There were  also attacks by Sikhs in the Ludhiana district  of Punjab, 90 kilometres (60 miles) southeast of Amritsar. Police shot dead six members of  what they called &quot;an armed mob.&quot;</p>
                      <p>A 24-hour  curfew remained in effect in most of the state of Punjab  as the army hunted down suspected terrorists and searched for arms caches.</p>
                      <p>The state  remained banned to foreign reporters who have to rely on government versions of  events or on the Indian media which generally play clown such news. </p>
                      <p>Meanwhile,  moderate Sikh leaders across India  warned that the entire Sikh community had been radicalized by the assault on  the holy precincts of the Amirtsar temple and the resulting death of  Bhindranwale.</p>
                      <p>&quot;I'm very  distressed and very angered,&quot; said Kushwant Singh, a prominent Sikh author  with a national following. &quot;It's an act of political folly. It will  alienate the entire Sikh community.&quot;</p>
                      <p>In a bid to  curb the protest violence, the government-controlled Indian television last  night showed of the Golden Shrine itself. It appeared to be undamaged by the  hand-to-hand combat that occurred as troops flushed out Sikh gunmen from their  last strongholds. </p>
                      <p>An  All-India radio reporter, apparently the first civilian allowed to enter the  complex after Wednesday's battle, said the small shrine in the centre of the  12-block temple compound was not hit in the shooting. He said the gold and  copper exterior of the shrine in the middle of a large artificial lake had not  even been scratched in Wednesday's army assault that claimed about 300 lives.                      </p>
