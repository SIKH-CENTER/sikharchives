                      <p>As an expatriate Indian, I fully  support your suggestion (A Touch Of Healing — editorial, June 15) that if  Indira Gandhi is interested in &quot;defusing tensions&quot; she should order  an inquiry into &quot;military excesses&quot; following the storming of the Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>Such an inquiry should be announced  without any further loss of time. Furthermore, leaders of the Sikh community  should be invited to associate actively with any such inquiry, so it is not subsequently  accused of bias.</p>
                      <p>The situation in India is volatile: killings in Assam last year, and in Bhiwandi and Bombay last month; the continuing death toll in Punjab, together with around 1,000 casualties on June 13.  These are ominous signs, and India's  political leadership should not take lightly the implications of these  deteriorating conditions.</p>
                      <p>Ajit Jain<br>

                      <p>Your editorial A Touch Of Heal­ing  (June 15) is perceptive, although parts of it are based on unconfirmed, and  perhaps not unmotivated, reports. For example, it is difficult for those who know the Sikhs and the Indian army  to believe that &quot;Sikh soldiers were forced at gunpoint to lead the  charge into the temple.&quot; </p>
                      <p>As regards the unfortunate loss of  lives you have, by now, seen that official sources in Delhi  have given the figure as 84 for the army and 492 for the rest as a result of  the encounter at the Golden   Tem­ple complex.</p>
                      <p>You imply that no restraint was  shown by the army. This is far from true, as seen from reports of foreign media  representatives who visited the Golden   Temple on June 14.</p>

                      <p>While you have printed many  photographs of angry Canadian Sikhs and reported their exaggerated claims of  &quot;injustice&quot; in India,  there has been little effort to clarify the history of Hindu-Sikh coexistence  in India.</p>
                      <p>Sikhs and Hindus have lived together  harmoniously for more than 500 years. There are few, if any, hstorically  recorded instances of violence between the two people. Sikhs have succeeded as  engineers, governors, film stars and in other professions. Their martial  prowess and business acumen have been highly regarded and rewarded. Sikhs and  Hindus have intermarried, celebrated one another's festivals and rubbed  shoulders in factories and on farms.</p>
