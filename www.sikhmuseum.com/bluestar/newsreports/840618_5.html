                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and  Mail<br>
                      June 18,  1984</p>
                      <p>By DREW  FAGAN</p>
                      <p>More than  300 Moslem and Sikh opponents of the Indian Government joined forces yesterday  at Toronto City   Hall to demand an end to the killing of civilians in the state  of Punjab and the city of Bombay.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Sikhs  and Moslems are up against the same ruthless dictatorship masquerading as a  democracy,&quot; Zafar Bangash, editor of an Islamic newspaper in Toronto, told the  chanting crowd.</p>
                      <p>Asaf  Shujah, an organizer of the rally, said the Sikh and Moslem communities should  begin joint fundraising for the victims of attacks by the Indian army:</p>
                      <p>&quot;Our  cause is now the same. We must prevent the transformation of India into a  Hindu society through the crushing of its minorities.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Yaqoob  Khan, president of the Canadian Institute of Islamic Studies, said Indian Prime  Minister Indira Gandhi is instituting a reign of terror against the Moslem  minority across India.</p>
                      <p>&quot;She  is trying to eradicate the, Moslems as an effective political force in India. Over  6,000 Moslems have been killed in Bombay  in the past month by Hindu extremists while the police looked on.&quot;</p>
                      <p>He told the  crowd, about 25 per cent of whom were Sikhs that Canada  should institute economic sanctions against India to persuade Mrs. Gandhi's  Government to stop &quot;treating Moslems like second-class citizens.&quot;</p>
                      <p>In an  interview, Mr. Khan said Moslems throughout India are a well assimilated  minority and, unlike the Sikhs, are not demanding an autonomous state.</p>
                      <p>&quot;We  are a God fearing people. Those who were murdered will achieve  immortality,&quot; said Gurdeep Singh Nagra, vice-president of the Federation  of Sikh Societies of Canada.</p>
                      <p>The Indian  army attacked the Sikhs' sacred Golden  Temple in Amritsar,  the capital of Punjab two weeks ago. Estimates  place the number killed in the battle at as many as 2,000.</p>
                      <p>&quot;There  is no law and justice in India.  The Government mutilated and' killed thousand of innocent people,&quot; Mr.  Nagra said, to cries of &quot;Khalistan&quot; the proposed name of an  Independent Sikh state in Punjab.</p>
                      <p>After the  demonstration at Nathan Phillips    Square, many of the demonstrators marched in the  rain to the Indian Consulate at Yonge and Bloor streets.</p>
