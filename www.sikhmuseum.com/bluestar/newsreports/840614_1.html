                      June 14, 1984</p>
                      <p>From Associated Press and CP</p>
                      <p>AMRITSAR, India — Soldiers shot several captive  Sikhs at point blank range last week after tying their hands behind their  backs, a doctor and a police official said yesterday.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Two of the Sikhs whose post­mortem  examinations I conducted had their hands tied at the back,&quot; said the  doctor, a Sikh who normally works in nearby Jullundur.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Some of my other colleagues  conducting post-mortems also came across young Sikhs who had been shot this  way,&quot; said the doctor, who did not want to be named. </p>
                      <p>The police official, also a Sikh,  said at last 13 Sikhs were tied up and shot by soldiers. Their turbans were  removed and used to tie their hands before they were killed by a single shot in  the forehead, he said. </p>
                      <p>Civilian and military sources say at  least 1,000 Sikhs and 220 soldiers died last week when troops stormed the Golden Temple  to flush out Sikh extremists blamed for more than 400 deaths in Punjab this year. </p>
                      <p>In New Delhi,  the Government yesterday defended the attack and said Sikh militants had  received support from Pakistan.</p>
                      <p>&quot;It is quite clear now that it  was a very deep seated conspiracy to create terror in Punjab  with the help of certain foreign powers and ultimately to try for a separate  state,&quot; Home Ministry spokesman M. K. Wali told reporters.</p>
                      <p>A statement released at the news  conference said the extremists pursued their goals &quot;with the active  encouragement, connivance and assistance of certain foreign powers.&quot; It  said the militants were trained in northern Kashmir state and Pakistan in  facilities billed as &quot;religious training camps.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Punjab borders Pakistan, which has fought three wars with India since  1947. Many of the arms seized from the temple were smuggled from Pakistan, the  Government says.</p>
                      <p>A local reporter in Amritsar said he saw a dozen Sikh youths  arrested in the temple who were forced to walk along the hot pavement on their  bare knees. &quot;The soldiers repeatedly kicked and punched them,&quot; said  the reporter, who also asked for anonymity.</p>
                      <p>The Jullundur doctor, an eye specialist who had  never done a formal post-mortem, headed a team that conducted 400 post-mortem  examinations. Most of the bodies were riddled by multiple bullets wounds and  bore scars inflicted by bombs, he said.</p>
                      <p>&quot;It was a virtual  massacre,&quot; he said. &quot;A large number of women, children and pilgrims  were gunned down.&quot;</p>
                      <p>The doctor said most bodies were  brought to the morgue in municipal garbage trucks. &quot;It has been a  nightmare,&quot; he said. &quot;When I sleep at night I dream of all those  decomposed bodies ....&quot;</p>
                      <p>Some dead militants, particularly  the temple guards, carried identity cards, but police tore up the cards to  avoid having to notify relatives of the deaths,&quot; he said.</p>
                      <p>In Ottawa,  External Affairs Minister Allan MacEachen said Canada  would be &quot;generous&quot; if an international move to give, humanitarian  aid to India  develops. After tomorrow, Canadian citizens attempting to enter India will  require visas, Mr. MacEachen said. An estimated 200,000 Sikhs live in Canada and many  have expressed concern about the fate of relatives in the country.</p>
                      <p>There are an estimated 50 Canadian  citizens in the Punjab, but Mr. MacEachen said Ottawa has &quot;no reason to believe at the  moment that there is any cause for apprehension.</p>
