                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      August 25, 1984</p>
                      <p>A criminal charge laid against a Sikh for smashing photographs at the Indian consulate in Toronto was withdrawn because the consul-general refused to testify.</p>
                      <p>The consul-general in Vancouver has also been told not to waive his diplomatic immunity and testify in a similar incident in that city, K. P. Fabian, acting high commissioner for India in Ottawa, said yesterday.</p>
                      <p>One of the reasons given by Mr. Fabian was that under Canadian law it was impossible to assure the consul-general in Toronto of a restriction on the questions he would be asked.</p>
                      <p>Jasbir Singh Saini, 20, a Grade 12 student, was charged with mischief to private property on June 6 at the consulate in Toronto.</p>
                      <p>Photographs of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Indian President Zial Singh, and Mohandas K. Gandhi, the father of India's non-violent freedom struggle, were smashed.</p>
                      <p>Two days later, Mr. Saint acknowledged that he had smashed the photographs but as &quot;a symbolic gesture of protest&quot; against the Indian<br>
                        Army's invasion of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India, the holiest shrine of the Sikhs.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Saini, who has only one arm, said he did not believe he had committed a criminal act. The charge was withdrawn yesterday by assistant Crown attorney Wade Nesbit at a provincial court in Etobicoke.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Nesbit said in an interview it was essential to the charge that the consul-general testify that the consulate in downtown Toronto was his property, that the man should not have damaged it and what the value of the damage was.</p>
                      <p>His argument was rejected by Surinder Lal Malik, the consul-general in Toronto, in an interview yesterday.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Malik argued that the Metro Toronto Police had the witness account of a woman guard from a security agency and a receptionist at the consulate.</p>
                      <p>&quot;I am surprised (at the charge being withdrawn),&quot; said Mr. Malik. &quot;The guard's evidence was good enough . . . . We were prepared to give a list of the damage.&quot;<br>
