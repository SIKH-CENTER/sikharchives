                      <p>Extra precautions had been ordered  for the Prime Minister, her son Rajiv, top Government officials and leaders of  Mrs. Gandhi's Con­gress (I) party. &quot;We are planning for the worst,&quot;  one source said. The sources said the security  threat, inside Punjab and outside its borders,  should be over within two months.</p>
                      <p>Security forces have rounded up  about 3,000 Sikhs since the army fought its way into the Golden  Temple in Amritsar on June 6 in a battle in which about  1,000 people were killed.</p>
                      <p>Correspondents who returned to New Delhi yesterday after driving through Punjab said army patrols checked vehicles every 20 kilometres.  But they said that despite the presence of the army, life was returning to normal  in the farming region, with villagers as anxious about the impending monsoons  as the Sikh crisis.</p>
                      <p>Transplanting of rice seedlings into  fields was in full swing throughout the state and trading was as hectic as ever  on the Punjab stock exchange in Ludhiana, about  240 kilometres from Amritsar.</p>
                      <p>Trains and buses, out of action for  the past two weeks, were running again.</p>
                      <p>But villagers appeared uncertain  about the future once the army returns to barracks.</p>
