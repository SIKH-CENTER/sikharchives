                      <p>Let's face it,&quot; say the Times  of India, &quot;the ship that is India is in serious trouble. If we  are lucky, it may drift into some reasonably safe port. If not. it can get  wrecked on its way to nowhere. We need not go into history to discover that not  all ships make it to port.&quot; That somber reflection on the present  condition of a country that is still known as the world's largest democracy  came as tension in troubled Punjab was  beginning to ebb. Three weeks after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent the  Indian army to Amritsar to flush Sikh terrorists  out of the Golden   Temple. she paid a visit  to the Sikhs' holiest shrine. All foreigners and journalists were still banned  from Punjab. but some curfew restrictions  throughout the state were lifted. Most temples were open again for Sikh  prayers, though the Golden   Temple remained closed  and under control of the army. Indian Airlines, the country's domestic carrier  resumed its flights to Amritsar  and buses were running again in most districts. But even as the Sikh heartland  returned to a semblance of normality, government officials emphasized that the  army would remain in Amritsar  in strength for at least two months and perhaps much longer.</p>
                      <p>As for the healing process the deaths  of the 600 people killed in the Amritsar  clash will take years, perhaps generations, to erase. It is likely to become  part of the permanent baggage of antagonism and distrust that afflict India's 746  million people of so many diverse races, religions, tribes, languages and  circumstances. Fully 83% of India's  population is Hindu; 11% is Muslim, 2.6% is Christian, and the remaining 3.4%  is divided among Sikhs, Jain, Buddhists, Parsis and others. Over the past year  there have been riots or incipient rebellions in places as scattered as Assam in the northeast, Kashmir and Punjab in  the north and Maharashtra in the west. Only a  month ago rioting broke out between Hindus and Muslims in the shantytowns  around Bombay,  leaving 258 dead. The Assamese are upset about the influx of refugees from  West Bengal and neighboring Bangladesh.  Every tribe has its nationalists, every community its zealots. For every  insurrection there area dozen more waiting to be born.</p>

                      <p>Mrs. Gandhi must answer her critics charges  that her military action against the Sikh rebellion was to some degree a  political act. Like her 1975 declaration of a state of emergency and her  detention of thousands of political opponents. her latest moves have had the  effect of reinforcing her position as the head of India's strong central government.  The conventional wisdom for the moment is that though she has alienated the  Sikhs by the events of the past month, her action has strengthened her popularity  among India's  Hindu majority. It also has removed whatever doubt there may have been that she  will win the election campaign that she must call by January 1985. It will be  her fifth race for national leadership. She stoutly denies any suggestion of a  political motive behind her latest actions. &quot;Elections come and go.&quot;  she said recently, but the unity of the country is much more important.&quot;  She has used this very criterion to put down unrest ever since she first came  to power in 1966.</p>
                      <p>And yet, given the depth of division  and tension in this huge polyglot country it is Indira Gandhi's primary  accomplishment that, like her father Jawaharlal Nehru, she has managed to  preserve the national unity. India  remains one of the poorest countries on earth, with an average per capita  income of $230 a year. The annual birth rate, after persistent and sometimes  drastic efforts at family planning, is still 2% adding 15 million a year to  the population. Though the constitution calls for free and compulsory education  for all children until 15, two-thirds of India's people are illiterate.  Despite all this India's  democratic institutions have remained intact since independence from Britain  was achieved in 1947. The army has never tried to seize power. Though she  demonstrated in 1975 that she could reinforce her will against her enemies by  legally invoking a state of emergency. Mrs. Gandhi subsequently showed, in  March 1977 that she could pay the price of the emergency's excesses by losing  the national elections. Almost three years later her opponents had  demonstrated that they were as fractious and bereft of leadership as ever, and  she returned to power with a renewed majority. One of the failings of Indian  democracy is that it has never developed an effective opposition. in part  because of the overshadowing influence of Nehru and later his daughter Indira.</p>
                      <p>Because Indian democracy has survived  against such heavy odds, it is impossible to prove Mrs. Gandhi wrong in her  emphasis on a strong central government. But there are many Indians and foreign  experts as well who argue that such a system has increased the country's internal  tensions. For instance Columbia University Professor Ainslie Embree sees most  of India's  recent disturbances as a pattern of &quot;attempts by the states to get more  autonomy.&quot; In the face of these efforts, he adds. &quot;Mrs. Gandhi is  digging in her heels. She believes that any threat to the autonomy of the  center is a threat to her personally.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Others criticize her penchant for  choosing, as the chief ministers of many states, weak underlings whom she can  dominate. Says one of India's  leading intellectuals: &quot;She has deliberately watered down the role of the  chief ministers. They are dummies in the lap of Mrs. Gandhi's  ventriloquism.&quot; Thus, weak state governments have enabled corruption and  political chicanery to flourish, thereby alienating minority groups and  exacerbating grievances. The cost of gaining political office is also on the  rise. In Maharashtra, a candidate for a state  assembly seat must now spend at least $20,000 to get elected, even though the  legal ceiling is $1,000. Says N.A. Palkhivala, a former Ambassador to the U.S.: &quot;In modern India,  Machiavelli would have remained unemployed because of his political  naivete.&quot; As for the rulers of the central government, declares Minoo  Masani, a member of India's  Constituent Assembly in 1947-48, &quot;I am not very optimistic that the 'new  class' in Delhi,  to borrow the phrase of Milovan Djilas, is prepared to disgorge the power it  has arrogated to itself.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Such criticism might suggest that  Mrs. Gandhi will face a close race in the forthcoming elections, but few  believe that. The economy is relatively healthy, the inflation rate only about  10%, and the country's fabled &quot;monsoon politics&quot; are once again  running in the Prime Minister's favor. The Sikhs may grumble that their  heartland has become &quot;the Ulster of India,&quot; but the majority of the  electorate appears to be on her side.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. Gandhi's problems with India's 15 million Sikhs have clearly been worsened  by the attack on the Golden   Temple. The fighting  caused a coalescence of Sikh moderates and extremists, vastly complicating the  task of future negotiations. It also caused fissures within the Indian army,  in which the tall and warlike Sikhs have always played a disproportionately  large role. According to an official spokesman last week, the interrogation of  Sikh prisoners indicated that 17 retired Indian army officers above the rank of  colonel had been involved in extremist activities. Of these, two officers had  collected large sums of money from people throughout Punjab,  even inside the temple, and used the funds to buy arms. One of the fund  collectors was said to have escaped to Europe,  while the whereabouts of the other was not known.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. Gandhi can probably no longer  negotiate with most of the moderate leaders of the Akali Dal, the Sikh  political party. A few, in fact, are now regarded as cowards by the enraged  Sikh community. She will have to await the emergence of a suitable Sikh leader,  possibly retired Lieut. General Jagjit Singh Aurora, a hero of the 1971 Bangladesh war.  In the past the Sikhs have sought the exclusive use of Chandigarh,  the Le Corbusier—designed city that since the creation of the predominantly  Hindu state of Haryana out of the heavily Sikh Punjab  in 1966 has served as the capital of both states. Mrs. Gandhi is prepared to  let the Sikhs have Chandigarh to themselves and  build a new capital for Haryana, but has asked that, in return, Punjab should allow two of its largely Hindu districts to  be transferred to Haryana. So far the Sikhs have refused.</p>
                      <p>In the aftermath of the storming of  the Golden Temple, Mrs. Gandhi described her  decision as a “painful&quot; one. But then, as she has done during previous  crises, she tried to shift the blame to external sources, charging that Pakistan and  perhaps the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had played a part in inspiring  the Sikh separatist movement. Pakistan's  President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq angrily denied those charges. &quot;There is no  truth to the allegations,&quot; Zia told TIME. &quot;To the contrary, Pakistan has gone out of its way to normalize  its relations with India.&quot;  He added that the Indians were only looking for &quot;scapegoats.&quot;  Indeed, the Indians offered no proof to support the charges except for two  bodies purported to be those of Pakistanis and a few assault rifles bearing Chinese  letters. In the classic &quot;checkerboard diplomacy&quot; of the region, India is the enemy of Pakistan,  which is the friend of China,  which, at least until recently, was the enemy of India.</p>
                      <p>In recent days Mrs. Gandhi has explained  her strategy before she decided to send the army into the temple. She had  wanted to give &quot;the maximum time&quot; to the Sikhs to settle the matter,  she said. &quot;We had clear information about the accumulation of arms and  about giving shelter to criminals and murderers.&quot; She told an interviewer,  &quot;We do not believe in war, but we have been attacked, we have had to  defend ourselves.&quot; Then, as if clinching the argument, she added, &quot;Mahatma  Gandhi, in his time, accepted that necessity.&quot;           </p>
