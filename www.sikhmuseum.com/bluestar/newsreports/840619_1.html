                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      June 19, 1984</p>
                      <p>From Associated Press and Reuter</p>
                      <p>AMRITSAR, India  — Military authorities yesterday freed 80 Sikh militants captured during the  army's assault on the sacred Golden Temple in Amritsar.  Two hundred other militants picked up in sweeps throughout Punjab  state were handed over to police.</p>
                      <p>At the same time, Lt. Gen.  Krishnaswamy Sundarji announced the army would hand over control of the  12 block temple compound to police and paramilitary personnel in a few weeks,  after rounding up the last of what he called Sikh terrorists from the  countryside.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Once we have flushed out the  extremists we will start withdrawing in a phased manner,&quot; he said at a  news conference. &quot;I hope in some weeks we will return to the  barracks.&quot;</p>
                      <p>The Press Trust of India news agency  said the Government expected normal rail and bus traffic to resume throughout Punjab today, ending a curfew imposed when troops were  sent into the troubled state on June 2 after local authorities proved unable to  control Sikh extremists. The first train into Amritsar would probably carry urgently needed  gasoline, cooking oil and sugar, PTI said.</p>
                      <p>The 80 militants released yesterday  were the first of 1,600 Sikhs in custody to be set free. Since the army moved  in, troops have searched 39 Sikh temples and four or five Hindu shrines as well  as villages throughout Punjab, General  Sundarji said.</p>
                      <p>Sikhs have been agitating for  religious and political concessions from the Government for Punjab,  where Sikhs are a slight majority. Some have campaigned for outright secession,  while others have pressed for a Vatican like status for the holy city of Amritsar and a  constitutional acknowledgement that their religion is distinct from Hinduism.</p>
                      <p>In New Delhi, authorities increased security for  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, whose life has been threatened. A commando squad  was stationed at her official residence and armed police patrolled roads  leading to her house. </p>
                      <p>In an interview with the Canadian  Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday, Mrs. Gandhi denied that the army's storming of  the Golden Temple  the holiest of Sikh shrines  had alienated the Sikh  community from the Government, but acknowledged that &quot;large numbers&quot;  of Sikhs were upset by the army action.</p>
