                      <p>NEW DELHI, June 23 — Prime Minister Indira  Gandhi today visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar,  the Sikh shrine that was the scene of fighting 16 days ago. She was reported  to have heard demands from the head priest that the army be withdrawn and  pilgrims be allowed to return.</p>
                      <p>Amritsar itself, which had been the center  of a Sikh movement aimed at greater autonomy for Punjab  state, was described as returning to normal. </p>
                      <p>The army continued its operation to  round up Sikh militants. Seventeen were arrested Friday and today, and one  person wanted in at least six murder cases was said to have been killed by the  police in Jullundur  district. </p>
                      <p>Residents of Amritsar arriving here, along with Indian  reporters, said the climate of fear that had gripped the city for months had  eased.</p>
                      <p>Nearly 600 people, according to official  reports, and perhaps more than 1,000, according to other estimates, were killed  during the army's invasion of the Golden   Temple compound, which  militants had turned into a fortress. Among the dead was a Sikh leader,  Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.</p>
                      <p><strong>Half-Hour Visit to Temple</strong></p>
                      <p>Mrs. Gandhi, accompanied by Government  radio and television reporters, spent half an hour in the temple. She touched  her shrouded head to the floor of the gold-sheathed inner sanctum, tendered an  offering of rupees and, while musicians chanted prayers, she took a mouthful of  the mush that is used in what corresponds to communion for Sikhs.</p>
                      <p>The scene was televised, apparently  as part of an effort to mollify Sikhs angry over the invasion of the temple.  During the visit, Mrs. Gandhi was told that some Sikh scriptures had been  damaged during the battle. Giani Sahib Singh, the head priest, demanded that  the army be pulled out and that worshippers be allowed to use the temple  during fixed hours.</p>
                      <p>The Punjab Government said it would  soon begin taking busloads of pilgrims to the temple to quell misgivings about  its condition.</p>
                      <p>The head priest also urged Mrs.  Gandhi to bring about an early release of innocent people arrested during the  temple raid and in army sweeps through the Punjabi countryside. Some official  sources say that perhaps 200 of the nearly 1,600 people arrested in the temple  raid are innocent pilgrims and that more than 100 are temple employees. More  than 4,000 have been reported arrested in all, and many of them are expected  to be released after screening.</p>
                      <p><strong>Lower Estimate Being Offered </strong></p>
                      <p>Some Government officials have now  returned to an estimate, made before the army moved into Punjab  on June 2, that no more than 400 to 500 militants were operating from the  temple. The identity of the others is unclear, though they are presumed to  include criminals, fugitives, and fringe members of the Bhindranwale group.</p>
                      <p>As normal traffic in and out of Punjab  picked up, a longtime Sikh resident of Amritsar  arrived here Friday and reported that &quot;in general, there is a very, very  big sense of relief in Amritsar</p>
                      <p>Just before the army action, he  said, Sikh militants capitalizing on the situation had created a climate of  fear throughout the city and its surrounding villages.</p>
                      <p>The resident said Sikhs and Hindus  alike felt the relief, although a residual fear remained that militants might  still seek revenge on people who were not with them.</p>
                      <p>At the same time, the Amritsar resident said,  &quot;people are afraid that when the army leaves, there will be further  looting and killing.&quot;</p>
                      <p>The resident also said that, according  to preliminary reports, army troops in both the city and the countryside were  behaving with restraint and courtesy. Although the soldiers searched houses at  will, first reports said, there was said to be little or no brutality.</p>
                      <p>Some people were reported killed in  curfew violations, however. A team of reporters from the Press Trust of India,  a news agency, also reported from Amritsar  that there were visible signs of relief among citizens and that, while there  was uneasy silence, there seemed to be no tension. </p>
                      <p>Business and social activity was  said to be reviving rapidly, in contrast to the weeks before the army  crackdown, when militants struck at will, business in some places came to a  halt, and people began to stay indoors.</p>
                      <p>Foreigners, including reporters, are  not allowed into Punjab, which for all the  reported signs of normalcy still remaim essentially under martial law.</p>
