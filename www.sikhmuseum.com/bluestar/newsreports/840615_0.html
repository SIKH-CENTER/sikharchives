                      <p>Gyani Zail Singh,  President, paid a two-hour visit to the Golden Temple in Amritsar. He spent an hour in  Harmindar Sahib, the main Gurudwara in the Golden Temple complex and saw for  himself that it remained unscathed eventhough some extremists fired on soldiers  from within. The President was happy that the soldiers did not fire back at the Harmindar  Sahib and preferred to suffer casualities.</p>
                      <p>The President was  received by the head priest, Sant Sahib Singh and he took part in the 'Sabad  kirtan'. The President, later visited the army cantonment  where a large quantity of arms including medium and light machine guns,  anti-tank rockets, anti-personnel mines, grenades, sten guns, rifles,  explosives captured from the terrorists were kept.</p>
                      <p>The President directed  the Governor Hr. B.D. Pande to get all damages to 'Akal Takht'  and 'Darshani Deodhi', main entrance to Harmindar Sahib, repaired immediately.</p>
                      <p class="headline2">THE PRIME MINSTER'S CALL FOR GIVING A 'HEALING TOUCH' TO THE WOUNDS INFLICTED BY THE HAPPENINGS IN PUNJAB </p>
                      <p>Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the  Prime Minister, called on June 8, for  giving a 'healing touch' to the wounds inflicted on the hearts of the people by  the recent Punjab incidents. The Prime Minister expressed sorrow over  what happened in Punjab and said that military action was unavoidable. No  Government could tolerate indefinitely the continued massacre of innocent  people by the terrorists. The Prime Minister said that the security of the  country could be maintained only when its people were united and disciplined.</p>
                      <p>The Prime Minister while  giving an interview with a correspndent of CBC on June 9, commented that the  Government of India had always kept the door open for negotiation with the  Akali Dal. The leaders who started the agitation, themselves knew that; it very  soon went out of their hands, into the hands of those people who had obviously  been brain-washed and had definitely received sophisticated training in using  weapons; their purpose had nothing to do with their demands and nothing to do  with religion. The Government's action was not against the Akali Dal or the  religious sentiments of the Sikhs. The Government acted specifically against a  small group of people who had taken control of the Golden Temple and had wanted to carry  out a prolonged war to secede from India. Government was still  keeping the door open for a reasonable settlement.</p>
                      <p class="headline2">APPEAL MADE BY GIANI SAHIB SINGH, HEAD PRIEST OF HARMINDAR  SAHIB, GOLDEN TEMPLE </p>
                      <p>&quot;Harmindar Sahib  comemmorates Guru Ram Das. It is the highest centre of Sikh religion where all  countries of the world got the message of true love and brotherhood. The  history of the Sikhs is closely linked with Harmindar Sahib. It is a sacred  desire of every Sikh to go on pilgrimage to this holy shrine whose doors are  open to one and all, irrespective of religion, caste or creed. Here we get the  message of truth and brotherhood. The unfortunate happenings of the last few  days have been most painful for all of us. At this sad time, the recitation of  Guru Granth Sahib is being relayed through Akashavani (A.I.R.) to bring us  peace and solace. We pray to the great Guru to grant us all the previlege of  paying our respects at the holy shrine as early as possible&quot;. In response  to a request for a message to the people, Giani Sahib Singh said &quot;We  should all live in love and peace&quot;.</p>
                      <p class="headline2">A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO THE ENTRY OF  ARMED FORCES INTO THE GOLDEN TEMPLE.</p>
                      <p>A number of unconfirmed  and motivated reports have appeared in the media, at times purportive to quote  civilian and military sources who &quot;do not wish to be identified&quot;.  Such reports have tended to give a slanted picture of the situation, have  exaggerated, the number of casualities and sought to give currency to horror  stories which have no basis in reality.</p>
                      <p>The following is an  account of the army operation and the cir-cumstances leading to it:</p>
                      <p>Akali morcha launched in  1981 under Sant Longowal gradually passed into the hands of the militant  Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his band of extremists and terrorists whose  declared intention was the creation of 'Khalistan', an exclusive nation for  Sikhs with the active encouragement, connivance and assistance of certain  foreign powers. The active arms of the movement were the All India Sikh  Students Federation (AISSF) led by Amrik Singh and a small, hard core of the  Nihang sect. Combining indiscriminate killing of Sikh opponents and innocent  members of other communities with vitriolic secessionist speeches, the  Bhindranwale group gradually wrested effective control of the Golden Temple  from the SGPC, whose members were forced to endorse his line at the peril of  being included in Bhindranwale's 'hit list'.</p>
                      <p>The internecine battle  within the Golden Temple was accompanied by  acquisition of sophisticated arms, which, as evident after recovery, included  anti-tank missiles, mines and heavy automatic weapons, besides rifles, and  grenades. Reports were received of military training being imparted to the  membered of the group in so called 'religious training camps' in Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan occupied kashmir.  Reports confirmed that military activities were coordinated by certain retired  and discharged ex-servicemen headed by Shabeg Singh who was a dismissed major  general due to corruption and malpractices. Simultaneously, the area around Golden Temple and the Temple itself was developed  into a virtually impregnable fortress imprisoned by fanatically motivated  insurgents. This included construction of well built weapon positions, parapet  walls and emplacements. In addition, high roof civilian houses on the periphery  were occupied by armed insurgents and used as well fortified forward defences.  Existing water tower, minarets and domes which overlooked the Temple were also fortified, not  only providing a very effective observation, but also enabling devastating fire  power to be effective across all approaches.</p>
                      <p>After  all other methods employed by the Government failed and quantum escalation of  terrorist activities continued against helpless and innocent civil population,  under Bhindranwale's orders from the Golden Temple, the army was charged  with the task of removing the terrorist menace, and restoration of law and  order and normalcy in Punjab.</p>
                      <p>In the first days of  June, army units were swiftly moved to their positions at Amritsar and other cities of Punjab where the growing  terrorist factions had been known to have been operating from religious places.  Quick coordination was carried out with police forces and civil administration.  Detailed orders were given to all troops to use only minimum force, show utmost  reverence to all holy places and to ensure no desecration or damage to  &quot;Harmindar Sahib&quot;, the sanctum sanctorum at the Golden Temple and the &quot;Darbar  Sahib&quot; of all Gurudwaras used as sanctuaries by the terrorists. The use of  high trajectory weapons and incendiary ammunition was debarred. Troops were  carefully instructed not to wear any leather item in the temple area and treat  all captured people with dignity and care till the process of screening was  over to identify terrorists and extremists.</p>
                      <p>A 36-hour curfew was  declared by the Punjab state from 2100 hours on 3   June 1984, and extended selectively to 6th   June 1984. Police cordons around the Golden Temple and certain other  terrorist hideouts was made effective by army units who also assisted in ensuring  that the curfew was not violated by the terrorists. From 1630 hours on 5th June  onwards, continuous appeals were made over loud speakeres to all within the  premises of the Golden Temple to come out and hand  themselves over to the authorities. 129 men, women and children came out.  Similar actions took place in a number of areas in Punjab. Full opportunity was  given to all the inmates of the Golden Temple, and other holy  Gurdwaras which the terrorists had usurped, to avoid bloodshed.</p>
                      <p>From 2230 hours, on June  5, army units commenced moving to the Golden Temple precints. This drew a  very heavy volume of fire from the terrorists into the narrow streets at close  range. Despite casualties, the troops closed in and slowly commenced movement  into the area around the temple, after overcoming initial opposition. Very  heavy volume of fire had to be faced from the Akal Takht which stood like a  fortress, sweeping all avenues of approach with deadly volumes of machine gun  fire, causing heavy casualities.</p>
                      <p>The  terrorists from the outer lines of defence, reinforced the Akal Takht and made  it a bastion of automatic weapons. Machine guns from Harmindar Sahib also raked  with fire the Parikarma and surrounding buildings where the troops had forced  back the defenders.</p>
                      <p>At 0100 hours on 6th  June, Sant Harchand Singh Longowal and Mr. G.S. Tohra surrendered near Guru  Nanak Niwas with about 350 people including some women and children.</p>
                      <p>At about 0410 hours on  6th June some troops attempting to close in with the Akal Takht in an armoured  personnel carrier (APC) were fired at by anti-tank rockets which damaged the  APC. By the morning of 6th June, the troops had engaged all loop holes at the  Akal Takht to clear some areas held by the troops, but were beaten off. A group  of 10 extremists surrendered with a white flag. Room to room fighting  continued in the Akal Takht till it was cleared by 1230 hours 6th June - though  some resistance continued from the ground floor.</p>
                      <p>That afternoon, the  troops made further appeals over lound­speakers for the terrorists to  surrender. As a result some 200 terrorists surrendered including 22 from  &quot;Harmindar Sahib&quot;. The 'Head Granthi' and two other 'Granthies' were  safe in 'Harmindar Sahib'.</p>
                      <p>The continued resistance  from the ground floor of the Akal Takht was tackled during the night of 6th and  7th June. When this resistance was finally overcome, Bhindranwale's dead body  was found in the basement among others and another 35 bodies were found in the  Akal Takht.</p>
                      <p>Some extremists and  terrorists remained active in the morning hours of 7th June using the  surrounding buildings and a number of tunnels in the areas of Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>It is emphasised that  right from the commencement of the planning stage of this operation, damage to  the temple buildings was not even contemplated and strict instructions were  issued to preserve the buildings. The heavy toll of the army casualities is an  indication of the deliberate restraint exercised on the power of troops in  order to ensure that the 'Akal Takht' and 'Harmindar Sahib' were not damaged  despite the murderous small arms and automatic fire which poured forth on our  troops form these supposedly holy buildings. The fire on the Akal Takht was  only opened when unacceptable losses began to accrue on troops and the  extremists escalated the use of anti-tank weapons.</p>
                      <p>A large cache of weapons,  ammunition and explosives were recovered from the Golden Temple complex including 47  machine guns, 47 self loading rifles, 247 .303 rifles, 66 muzzle loading guns,  11 mix type of rifles, 26 mix type of sten guns, 9 combines, 74 revolvers or  pistols, 1 rocket launcher, 561 hand grenades, 33 smoke grenades, 2 medium  machine guns. More recoveries are continuing.</p>
                      <p>Till the last, efforts  were made to preserve the sanctity of the 'Akal Takht'. Surprisingly the  extremists resorted to firing with automatic weapons at troops even from within  Harmindar Sahib and inflicting heavy casualties. As can be seen from the layout  of the defences, troops progressing operations along any wing of the temple  complexes came under heavy fire from the opposite wing of the temple complex  and in most cases if the fire was to be returned the Harmindar Sahib was  directly on the line of fire and troops could not fire back. Inspite of heavy  provocation and heavy casuality the troop had to take a very difficult decision  to accept all these constraints and ensure that not one single round was fired  on Harmindar Sahib. Few armies in the world would have willingly suffered  casualities under the circumstances.</p>
                      <p>It will also be seen from  the details of casualities suffered by troops that the proportion of officers  and JCOS casualities was high. This only goes to prove that responsible leaders  were always in the fore front to ensure that the task is accomplished in accordance  with the directives of the government. The operation left 84 soldiers and 492  others dead, 262 army jawans injured, 40 of them officers and JCOS.</p>
                      <p>The  large quantity of arms, ammunition, explosives and some radio sets recovered  at the Golden Temple complex, the thorough training and resolute leadership of  the terrorists and extremists and their ruthless conduct in the holy Sikh  shrines, must come as a surprise to most right thinking Indians. We must ask  ourselves where all this was leading to. That were the eventual aims of this  movement? They had support and encouragement from some foreign countries and  had effectively controlled the Punjab country side by ruthless  terrorism with the command headquarters at the Akal Takht and had all but made  the administration totally ineffective. The taking over of the moderate Sikh  leadership and fortfying a large number of Gurudwaras as safe sancturies all  over Punjab, together with subtle and insidious propoganda in all Sikh organisations  that the 'Panth is in danger' indicated a thrust towards much bigger stakes  than merely getting a better deal for the Sikhs. The obvious direction and  thrust of the movement was towards an independent &quot;Khalistan&quot; fully  supported by neighbouring and foreign powers. The terrorists led by  Bhindranwale were perhaps only cogs in the wheel. If the army action had not  been resolute and determined, the movement would have moved towards full scale  insurgency which would have crippled the armed forces in any future  confrontation across the borders.</p>
