                      <p class="fs14italic">Globe and Mail<br>
                      June 11, 1984</p>
                      <p>From AP, Reuter and New York Times</p>
                      <p>AMRITSAR — Almost 800 Sikh militants and 200  soldiers were killed last week in an Indian Army assault on the Sikhs' sacred Golden Temple  in Punjab and hundreds of people were wounded,  army and police sources said yesterday.</p>
                      <p>At least 20 more were killed on  Saturday night as troops attempted to hold down violent reaction to the  assault. Sniper fire persisted yesterday.</p>
                      <p>In the northeastern state of Bihar, an army commander was shot dead and Sikh troops  deserted his unit, the Government said. The mutineers were &quot;on the way  to Delhi with  arms.&quot; </p>
                      <p>The Government also said it has  decided to form a 23,000 man special force, to be called the National Security  Guard, to suppress sectarian violence.</p>
                      <p>Bodies still were being removed from  the holy lake surrounding the seventeenth century shrine and up to 50 at a time  are being cremated because them is not enough wood for individual funeral  pyres, the army and police sources said. </p>
                      <p>Garbage trucks have taken away 780  bodies to be cremated.</p>
                      <p>More than 500 soldiers were wounded  in the attack on the temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh faith, but a place  also where many Sikh extremists sought haven and where they stored their  weapons.</p>
                      <p>The army has said officially that  300 to 400 Sikhs and 59 soldiers were killed in the siege last Tuesday and  Wednesday.</p>
                      <p>The soldiers shot their way into the  white marble and burnished copper temple after being driven back twice. At  least one tank and one armored personnel carrier were destroyed by militants  using Belgian made anti-tank missiles, they said.</p>
                      <p>Some of the Sikhs were slain by  followers of militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale when they tried to  surrender, the sources said. Mr. Bhindranwale was found dead in the temple's  Akal Takht or &quot;immortal seat&quot; of the five high priests.</p>
                      <p>The temple battle climaxed  increasing violence in Punjab that left some  300 people killed in the past three months. Most of the victims were Hindus  slain by Sikh extremists.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Bhindranwale's followers made  three attempts to kill moderate Sikh leaders Harchand Singh Longowal and  Gurcharan Singh Tohra, said Amritsar  police Superintendent Sital Das.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Longowal, president of the  Sikhs' Akali Dal political party, and Mr. Tohra, president of the temple  management committee, surrendered to the army and are in jail in Rajasthan. </p>
                      <p>The Akali Dal had led the Sikh  agitation for more religious and political autonomy for the 13 million Sikhs in  this country of 750 million peo­ple.</p>
                      <p>There were conflicting reports in Amritsar about Mr.  Bhindranwale's death. One version is that he and his two top lieutenants had  formed a pact and killed each other. Another is that he was killed in a  prolonged burst of army gunfire when soldiers found him.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Bhindranwale was wearing a  flowing white robe and a blue turban, the sources said, and the left side of  his face was shot off.</p>
                      <p>Some scattered fighting continued in  the Golden Temple area. On Friday, Sikh militants  fired three rockets at a military post, killing a soldier who was brushing his  teeth and seriously wounding a civilian, the sources said.</p>
