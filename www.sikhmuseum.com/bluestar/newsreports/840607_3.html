                      June 7, 1984</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840607_3b.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="500" align="right" class="pictureright1">NEW DELHI (AP-Reuter) —India's  decision to storm the Golden Temple, holiest shrine of the Sikh religion, has  its roots in longstanding religious differences — and agitation by some Sikhs  for a homeland and greater autonomy.</p>
                      <p>The Indian government said the  attack, which claimed hundreds of lives of Sikhs, including militant leader  Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, and at least 48 soldiers, was a last resort.</p>
                      <p>It was triggered, they said, by  militants who refused to surrender, attacked Hindus, attempted to disrupt  grain shipments from Punjab and tried to  sabotage power and water supplies.</p>
                      <p>In all. Sikh militants are blamed  for terrorist acts that have claimed nearly 400 lives in the past four months,  not including yesterday's fighting.</p>
                      <p>The Golden  Temple in Amritsar,  400 kilometres (250 miles) north of New    Delhi, has been used by the militants as a command  post, a sanctuary for wanted criminals anal as a warehouse for weapons, the  government said. </p>
                      <p>The white marble temple with a  copper dome covers an area of about 12 city blocks where about 3,000 Sikhs  live. It is surrounded on all sides by a lake where wor­shippers bathe to wash  away their sins. </p>
                      <p>Sikh moderates were eclipsed by  Bhindranwale, a fiery bare­foot preacher who told Sikhs they were enslaved by  majority Hindus and ordered them to buy guns and kill their enemies. <br>
                        </p>
                      <p>Bhindranwale took over the Akal  Takht, the seat of the Sikh religion, and surrounded himself with  machinegun carrying bodyguards.</p>
                      <p><strong>Swamped by  Hindus</strong></p>
                      <p align="left"><img src="images\840607_3a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="560"></p>
                      <p>The Sikh religion was founded 500  years ago in northern India  as a monotheistic alternative to Hinduism.</p>
                      <p>Some Sikhs complain that they are  being swamped by the Hindu Mainstream and categorized as a Hindu sect instead  of a separate religion.</p>
                      <p>India's 13 million Sikhs make up 2 per  cent of India's 700 million  population, but they comprise 52 per cent of Punjab's  17 million people. Punjab is India's  breadbasket and home of its green revolution. </p>
                      <p>Sikhs traditionally are warriors  and farmers, and they make up a large percentage of the armed forces. They have  complained, however, that they are suffering from job discrimination and that  their numbers are being reduced in the armed forces. </p>
                      <p>They also say they are overtaxed in  Punjab and underpaid for their wheat. They  want a greater share of interstate river waters, which are being diverted to  neighboring states of Haryana and Rajasthan.</p>
                      <p>Sikhs also want a constitutional  amendment classifying them as a separate religion rather than a Hindu sect.</p>
                      <p>The Indian government has conceded  most of their 44 demands, has agreed to refer the river dispute to a tribunal  and said it would consider a constitutional amendment.</p>
                      <p>But it has refused to hand over Chandigarh without reciprocal territorial concession by Punjab to neighboring Haryana.</p>
                      <p>The Indian government has said it  would never grant independence to Punjab  because that would encourage separatist movements now boiling in the north,  northeast and south.</p>
                      <p>The militant Sikhs are represented  by the Akali Dal political party and its leader, Harchand Singh Longowal. But  Bhindranwale emerged as the most powerful Sikh leader with an enormous  populist appeal to millions of &quot;born again&quot; young Sikhs.</p>
                      <p>The Indian government considered  Bhindranwale a key figure among the terrorists, and he faced 11  murder conspiracy charges in connection with terrorist attacks when he died in  yesterday's army assault on his headquarters.</p>
                      <p>Bhindranwale's followers support  all the Akalis' 44 demands and many want much more, including death for Hindu  &quot;oppressors&quot; and a separate homeland. </p>
                      <p>Events leading up to the storming  of the Sikh's Golden Temple at Amritsar  began in August, 1982, when the Sikh's main political party began campaigning  for concessions in India's Punjab state. Here are the major events, starting in  April, 1983:</p>
                      <p>April 4: At least 21 people die and 200  are injured as police clash with members of a voluntary Sikh force that had  been organizing a 24-hour road blockade as one of several peaceful protests  under Akali chief Longowal.</p>
                      <p>April 5: Gandhi's son Rajiv receives  a death threat from a Sikh extremist group.</p>
                      <p>April 25: A senior policeman is shot  dead outside the Golden   Temple. Police demand  that his killer and other extremists believed to have taken refuge in the  temple be handed over to author­ities.</p>
                      <p>October 6: Presidential rule is imposed  on Punjab and Gandhi dissolves the state  government after Sikh extremists drag six Hindus from a bus and kill them. </p>
                      <p>March 5: The government introduces  emergency' powers in Punjab, allowing police  and paramilitary forces to arrest suspects and search premises for arms and  explosives without the usual permits.</p>
                      <p>April 25: Government passes a bill  allowing suspected extremists to he detained without trial for up to two years.</p>
                      <p>May: The deaths of two Hindu  politicians and a journalist increase the pressure on the government to take  tough action. </p>
                      <p>June 1: In a fierce seven hour  gunbattle around the perimeter of the Golden Temple  complex, 11 people are killed.</p>
                      <p>June 2: Curfew is clamped on all  towns in Punjab, the press is restricted,  communications are cut, state borders closed and transport prohibited. The army  is sent into Punjab.</p>
                      <p>June 3: Crack troops surround the Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>June 5: Armed Sikhs in the Golden Temple  precincts exchange mortar and machinegun fire with the Indian army. Then the  troops attacked.</p>
