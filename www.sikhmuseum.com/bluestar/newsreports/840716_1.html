                      <p class="fs14italic">Toronto Star<br>
                      July 16, 1984</p>
                      <p>AMRITSAR (Reuter) — Authorities in India have imposed an eight hour curfew here to  prevent a march today by Sikh women &quot;suicide squads&quot; to the Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>Sikh officials said the army had  arrested at least 2,000 Sikhs in the past two days in an attempt to stop the  march to the Sikhs' holiest shrine, scene of a bloody battle last month.</p>
                      <p>They said all roads leading to the  city had been sealed and bus service from neighboring cities had been  suspended. </p>
                      <p>But former MP Rajinder Kaur vowed last  night to defy the curfew and lead an all female march today and more the following  days until the government gives in.</p>
                      <p>&quot;We may face bullets but we  will go forward,&quot; she said. &quot;I will sing hymns even if soldiers fire  bullets at me.</p>
                      <p>&quot;The first squad will be  followed by others every day until the troops pull out from the Golden Temple.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Punjab officials talked with six leaders  of the Akali Dal, the main Sikh party, and tried to persuade them to drop plans  to lead a march on the temple from Faridkot district about 110  kilometres (70 miles) to the south, the  United News of India reported.</p>
                      <p>But the Sikhs refused to cooperate,  the news agency said, and the officials ordered their arrest.</p>
                      <p>Witnesses said soldiers with  automatic weapons have taken up positions on rooftops near the Sahidan Temple  and there were many soldiers on roads leading to the Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>About 1,000 Sikhs and 100 soldiers  were killed when troops stormed the Golden   Temple June  6 to capture Sikh extremists waging a guerrilla war for political and religious  concessions from the central Indian government.</p>
                      <p>Meranwhile, in the Pakistan border state of Jammu   and Kashmir, witnesses said 300 protesters staged a march in the  capital, Srinagar,  shouting &quot;Allah-o-Akbar&quot; (God is great) and waving black flags.</p>
                      <p>The march was led by ousted chief  minister Farouq Abdullah and began at his National Conference party headquarters.</p>
                      <p>Abdullah, kicked out of office 12  days ago, came out of hiding Saturday night after a curfew was lifted in the  city and told supporters he would lead the march. </p>
                      <p>Troops fired into the air and police  used nightsticks to break up the march. Witnesses said protesters fled in  panic, but the police claim there were no injuries. </p>
                      <p>Abdullah was dismissed from office  two weeks ago when at least 12 of his supporters defected, leaving him in a  minority in the state assembly</p>
