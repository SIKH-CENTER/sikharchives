                      June 27, 1984</p>
                      <p>NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian authorities  abruptly closed the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab state, yesterday, a day  after the Sikh shrine was reopened for the first time since army troops stormed  the temple compound three weeks ago.</p>
                      <p>The reason for the closing was not  announced, but officials may have feared they could not control crowds trying  to enter the shrine. </p>
                      <p>The gates to the temple were shut  after 300 pilgrims were allowed inside, the United News of India news agency  reported. Officials turning back hundreds of others said they were trying  &quot;to maintain law and order.&quot;</p>
                      <p>It was not known whether the temple  would be opened today. </p>
                      <p>On Monday, 10,000 pilgrims flocked  to the white marble and burnished copper temple, forming long lines at the  gates. No violence was reported, but witnesses said many pilgrims were highly  agitated over what they considered desecration of the shrine. Some cursed the  presence of troops and vowed to seek revenge.</p>
                      <p>The army stormed the temple compound  on June 6 to attack Sikh extremists accused of waging a terror campaign for  Sikh autonomy in Punjab state. The Government  says 492 Sikh militants and 92 sol­diers were killed in the battle, but police  and military sources in Amritsar  place the toll at about 1,000 Sikhs and 220 troops.</p>
                      <p>Army troops remain inside the  compound. On Monday, officials said the temple would be open daily for three  hours in the morning, from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.</p>
                      <p>Many of the pilgrims who streamed  through the temple on Monday were weeping over the assault and crying &quot;Let  the army go&quot; and &quot;We want revenge.&quot; Some picked up charred  scraps of holy Sikh manuscripts, kissed them and kept them as relics, said Sikh  pilgrims who toured the battered complex.</p>
