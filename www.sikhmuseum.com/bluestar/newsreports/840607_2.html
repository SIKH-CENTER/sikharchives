                        June 7, 1984</p>
                      <p><img src="images\840607_2a.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="200" align="right" class="pictureright1">NEW DELHI (AP) — Government soldiers  today found the bullet-riddled body of Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale  in a bunker in Amritsar's Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>The discovery came as special army  units mopped up the last pockets of resistance at the end of a two-day assault  on the heavily fortified shrine in which at least 250 Sikhs and 59 sol­diers  died.</p>
                      <p>More than 450 Sikh extremists were  captured during the battle as Indian army troops, backed by tank and rocket  fire, stormed the 12-block area compound.</p>
                      <p>Angry Sikhs demanded Bhin­dranwale's  body be turned over to them and rioting and arson flared in New Delhi and other cities as Sikhs protested  the seizure of the temple, the holiest in the Sikh reli­gion.</p>
                      <p>Police fired tear gas to disperse  400 Sikhs in New Delhi, 400 kilo­metres (250  miles) south of Amrit­sar.</p>
                      <p>The bodies of Bhindranwale, a  37-year-old fundamentalist preacher who has led a two‑year terrorist campaign  for greater Sikh rights, and two aides were recovered from the fortified basement  of the Akal Takht. As the throne room of Sikh gurus, it is considered the  &quot;seat of immortal power.&quot;</p>
                      <p>He and followers armed with with  machineguns had held out against the government forces after the army took  control of the rest of the sprawling 17th century temple yesterday.</p>
                      <p>It was not immediately known how  Bhindranwale died, but he had vowed to kill himself rather than surrender or be  captured. The head of the youth wing of the Sikh political party, the Akali  Dal, claimed Bhindranwale was murdered.</p>
                      <p>&quot;There were 72 rounds in Bhin­dranwale's  body and they (sol­diers) shook his body to see if he was still alive,&quot;  Kuldip Singh told reporters in the capital. He did not say how he obtained the  informa­tion.</p>
                      <p>Punjab state was sealed off by authorities  last. Saturday. Roads were barricaded, telephone lines were 'cut, a  round-the-clock cur­few was imposed and Western journalists were ordered out.</p>
                      <p><strong>Aides found  dead</strong></p>
                      <p>Singh said Sikh youths would march  to Amritsar  tomorrow to demand the return of Bhindranwales<br>
                        body and the others for cremation.  The Sikh religion requires cremation within 24 hours of death. &quot;If one  Bhindranwale dies, a thousand are born,&quot; he said.</p>
                      <p>Soldiers also were reported to have  found the bodies of Amrik Singh, Bhindranwale's nephew and president of the  outlawed Sikh Students Union, and a retired major-general said to be the  mastermind of the Golden   Temple defence in the  last few days.</p>
                      <p>Major Indian newspapers gave guarded  approval today to the military raid on the temple, calling it a courageous and  inevitable move to stamp out sectarian extremism.</p>
                      <p>&quot;All right-thinking people will  heave a sigh of cautious relief...The centre (government) was left with no  other alternative but to take firm action,&quot; the Hindustan Times said in an  editorial.</p>
                      <p><strong>New  protests</strong></p>
                      <p>An Indian Express editorial said the  attack was traumatic and emotionally searing for all In­dians, particularly  Sikhs, but added: &quot;Forcing entry into the hallowed precincts of the Golden Temple  complex has exorcised an evil...There is no defeat or victory in this dreadful  encounter. India  has suffered.&quot;</p>
                      <p>In London,  The Guardian said: &quot;The bloody climax of the siege of Amritsar could easily drive moderate Sikhs to  new levels of protest at home and abroad .. . </p>
                      <p>&quot;The Indian army's inevitable  triumph at the Golden   Temple could easily  become both a .pyr­rhic victory and the harbinger of further trouble. Mrs.  (Indira) Gandhi, having sown the breeze, has not yet finished reaping the  whirlwind.&quot;</p>
                      <p>Bhindranwale was responsible for the  wave of Sikh violence in Punjab that has claimed about 400 lives — mostly Hindu  — in the last four months, not counting the 300 deaths in the final battle for  the Golden Temple.</p>
                      <p>The Sikhs have demanded a number of  political and religious concessions from the central government, ranging from a  greater share of interstate waters for Pun­jab  to classification as a separate religion instead of a branch of Hinduism.</p>
                      <p>Lt.-Gen. R. S. Dayal said troops had  seized control of the complex early this morning, including the copper-domed  temple itself. </p>
                      <p>Troops also arrested several hundred  people in raids on 37 other religious shrines, including 31 Sikh temples, Dayal  said. The United News of India news agency said 20 people died in fighting at  one of them.</p>
                      <p>News of the military action spread  quickly through India's  Sikh community, setting off vio­lence in several areas:</p>
                      <p>Twelve people, apparently Hin­dus,       were killed by a Sikh mob in Kathunangal village in Amritsar. the United News of India said;</p>
                      <p>In the northern city of Jammu, Sikh       protesters killed one police­man and attacked government of­fices and       Hindu-owned shops, po­lice said;</p>
                      <p>At the biggest Sikh temple in       New Delhi, Sikhs burned four city buses and hurled rocks and bricks at       police, who responded by firing tear gas shells into the compound;</p>
                      <p>More than 11,000 people fleeing       the violence in neighboring Pun­jab state have streamed into this small       town of Ambala,       turning it almost overnight into a refugee camp. Doctors and nurse's work       round. the clock in makeshift tents treat­ing the sick, mostly victims of       heat exhaustion. But the sanitation facilities are inadequate and medi­cal       authorities fear the outbreak of epidemics.</p>
