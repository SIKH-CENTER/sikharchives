                      <p class="fs14italic">Toronto Sun<br>
                      June 11, 1984</p>
                      <p>By JOE KONECNY<br>
                        Staff Writer</p>
                      <p>About 4,000 Sikhs and Muslims from  across Ontario vowed yesterday to get revenge  for Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's &quot;gross genocidal slaughter&quot; of  their compatriots in India.</p>
                      <p>The protesters formed a  three quarter mile long procession that filled two lanes as it moved south on  University Ave. from Queens' Park to Nathan Phillips Square. </p>
                      <p>The marchers chanted and proclaimed  their allegiance to a new sovereign Sikh state in India — Khalistan — and called for  Canadian support.</p>
                      <p>Several effigies of Gandhi were  burned and beaten with swords, sticks and shoes at City Hall.</p>
                      <p>&quot;We are scared our friends and  relatives in India are being  butchered by Gandhi, and as citizens of Canada,  we have a right to know how and why our people are being killed,&quot; said  Gurnam Singh, chairman of Siri Guru Singh Sabha, the Sikh society of Toronto.</p>
                      <p>&quot;We hope the Canadian  government will send a committee — working in conjunction with the Sikhs — to  review the situation in India,&quot;  said Singh.</p>
                      <p>Singh said the protest was in  response to Indian troops' advance last week on the Golden Temple of Amritar. </p>
                      <p>While initial media reports said  Sikh extremists' leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and 300 supporters were  killed, Singh said the death toll was in the thousands.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Up until then (the attack on  the Golden Temple), we weren't terrorists, as  Gandhi called us,&quot; said Darshan Singh, the Sikh society's secretary.  &quot;But now we are — just in India,  nowhere else.</p>
                      <p>&quot;They attacked us and we're the  enemies now, simple as that,&quot; he said. &quot;We are separate from India now. We  are a sovereign state.&quot;</p>
                      <p>The society's secretary general, Dr.  Gurcharan Singh Jauhal said that Ontario's  Sikh community can do a lot to aid their peoples' struggle.</p>
                      <p>&quot;We will try to stop aid to India,&quot; said Singhjauhal, adding there are  300,000 taxpaying Sikhs in Canada  who will put pressure on the government.</p>
                      <p>&quot;Sikhs are awakened now and  we're all one,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll die to the last drop of blood . .  .&quot;</p>
                      <p>About 200 Sikhs at the Sri Guru Singh  Sabha Temple  on Old Weston Rd.  vowed to boycott Air India  and threa­tened reprisals against anyone who violated it.</p>
                      <p>In Vancouver,  some 10,000 Sikhs marched to the Indian consulate, denouncing Gandhi and  mourning the loss of their leader in the Punjab.</p>
                      <p>In Montreal, about 700 Sikhs marched five  kilometres (3.2 miles, through the downtown core</p>
