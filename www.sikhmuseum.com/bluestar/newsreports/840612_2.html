                      June 12, 1984</p>
                      <p>BY JOHN GRAY</p>
                      <p><em><img src="images\840612_2a.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="600" class="pictureright1">&quot;Only sheep and goats are afraid. I am the son of a lion.</em><br>
                          <em>I am not afraid to go out. I am not sitting here out of fear. I am only  sitting here because the agitation is going on in Punjab.  &quot;For as long as it is going on, I am bound to live here because I have  made a prayer. I have made a vow.&quot; —Jarnail Singh Bhind­ranwale.</em></p>
                      <p>Nobody, least of all the shrewd  Indira Gandhi, could have been surprised that militant Sikhs in India and abroad would view the death  last week of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale as nothing less than the murder of a  saint. </p>
                      <p>Even moderate Sikhs fear that Prime  Minister Gandhi has created a martyr. Certainly, Mr. Bhindranwale would not  have been surprised. After all, he had been preparing for his martyrdom for  some time.</p>
                      <p>India is a land whose history has been  written in blood, so violence is not remarkable. What made Mr. Bhindranwale so  special was that he had become the voice of a rage which may yet threaten the  very integrity of India.</p>
                      <p>In the past two years literally  hundreds of Indians, both Sikh and Hindu, have died in a campaign of wanton  terrorism throughout Punjab, where Sikhs are  marginally in the majority. Terror begat revenge, and that begat further  revenge. </p>
                      <p>To the Sikhs who visited the Golden Temple,  the holiest of Sikh shrines, Mr. Bhindranwale held out the vision of violence  to which they had been or would be victim. Hindus were slaughtering Sikhs.  Hindus were enslaving Sikhs. The Sikhs must be liberated from their oppressors. </p>
                      <p>The holy man would read out a list  of the enemies of the Sikhs. His sermons were sold on cassettes in the dusty  streets surrounding the Golden   Temple. If and when those  on the hit list happened later to get hit, Mr. Bhindranwale was not stricken  with grief.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Bhindranwale urged his followers  to buy revolvers and told them not to bother with licences. When he said that,  it was probably accompanied by that sardonic expression, mainly the laughter  of his eyes, which said he knew you understood what he meant.</p>
                      <p>That expression flickered frequently  across his face when I met him last November and he talked of the wave of violence  in Punjab and the struggle between militant Sikhs and the Government of Mrs.  Gandhi in New Delhi.</p>
                      <p>It was, by any measure, a bizarre  interview. My guide was an official of Akali Dal, the Sikh political party,  and he led the way through the rabbit warren of dark corridors and narrow  passageways in the Golden   Temple complex where Mr.  Bhindranwale had taken asylum several months before.</p>
                      <p>Our destination was the flat roof  over looking the Golden   Temple and, at every  landing on the way up, the passage was barred by one or two Sikh guards armed  with anything from a Sten gun to a bolt-action Lee Enfield left over from the  days of the British Raj. The presence of the guide was comforting.</p>
                      <p>On the roof in the bright morning  sun, Mr. Bhindranwale was reading scriptures. Around the perimeter of the  roof, as the sun glinted off a nearby temple, armed Sikh guards surveyed the  crowd of silent worshippers seated at the feet of the holy man. The silhouette  of the worshippers against the cloudless blue sky was set off by the turbanned  heads bowed in prayer and a dozen rifle barrels pro­truding from the crowd of  seated figures. </p>
                      <p><img src="images\840612_2b.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="297" class="pictureright1">The fame of Mr. Bhindranwale did not  begin in the Golden   Temple. He took up  residence in the temple only after he had become a charismatic figure in the Punjab countryside, travelling from village to village  to revile Sikhs who had strayed from the path of fundamentalism and to rescue  those willing to be rescued.</p>
                      <p>It was from those days that he  earned his reputation throughout India as the Khomaini of the Sikhs.  That reputation grew as he pushed more moderate Sikhs aside or drew them into  more revolutionary militancy.</p>
                      <p>He was tall and handsome, imposing  in a royal blue turban and a dazzling white robe. He carried the traditional  Sikh kirpan, a curved dagger. And slung over one shoulder was a cartridge  belt, and around his waist in a shiny brown leather holster was a .38 calibre  revolver.</p>
                      <p>The charisma palpably had not waned.  As we stood and talked, the worshippers crowded around to hear the interview,  the translated questions and the hoarse reply. They watched one face and then  the other, and when Mr. Bhindranwale permitted himself that sardonic  expression, the mocking laughter of the eyes, they laughed with delight.</p>
                      <p>A few departing worshippers touched  him on the arm as they left, others laid money on the ground and tugged gently  at the hem of his robe to signal what they had done. He did not stoop for that;  an aide picked up the money.</p>
                      <p>He talked easily, if a bit disdainfully,  of the political demands of the militant Sikhs. The intent crowd of worshippers  around us were silent when the questions turned to violence.</p>
                      <p>But Mr. Bhindranwale was not eager  to talk to an outsider about violence. There were questions about an attack on  a bus a few weeks before; six Hindus were lined up beside the bus and  slaughtered for no reason other than that they were Hindu. </p>
                      <p>With his arms crossed, Mr. Bhindranwale  listened to the question impassively. Violence, he said, and threw back his  head. The central Government invited violence. Ask the Government. The crowd  nodded. There was just the flicker of sardonic laughter in the eyes, and a  brief smile, and the crowd laughed.</p>
                      <p>Measured against the encircling guns  and the mounting toll of the slaughter in Punjab,  the laughter was not pleasant.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Gray is Ottawa bureau chief for The Globe and Mail.</p>
