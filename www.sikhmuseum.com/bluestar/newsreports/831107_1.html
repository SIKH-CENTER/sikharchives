                      <p><img src="images\831107_1a.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="298" align="right" class="pictureright1">For India's  15 million Sikhs, the city of Amritsar  is a sacred place, and its ho‑<br>
                        liest sanctuary is the Golden Temple,  a resplendent 72-acre compound that is known to the faithful as the City of Joy. These days it more  closely resembles a city of death. Inside the temple com­pound, fierce Sikh  warriors wield subma­chine guns, guarding against encroach­ment by government  security forces. Outside, the security men keep a nervous vigil, all too aware  that the bodies of mur­dered comrades often turn up in the war­ren of tiny  streets around the shrine.</p>
                      <p>Thus has Amritsar,  in the northwest­ern state of Punjab, become  the center of a bitter feud between Sikhs and Hindus. Distinguished by their  traditional beards and turbans, the Sikhs follow their own casteless.  monotheistic religion, and over the past 15 months those in the Punjab have  mounted a determined drive for greater autonomy from New Delhi. The more the government of Prime  Minister Indira Gandhi has resisted, the more sav­age the Sikh campaign has  become. Last month six men hijacked a night bus at gunpoint, herded eleven  Hindu men into a field and, with cold-blooded efficiency, shot six of them dead  (five escaped). Hours later, terrorists randomly opened fire in an express  train, killing two officials.</p>
                      <p>These outbursts prompted New Delhi to impose  President's rule, effectively re­moving power from local authorities. More than  3,000 government troops in Amritsar  were then licensed to shoot on sight, arrest without warrants and even  penetrate traditionally off-limits Sikh sanctuaries (a step they have yet to  take). But the violence has not abated. Two weeks ago, 17 were killed and 133  wound­ed when terrorists derailed a crowded train. Since the bloodshed began  last year, more than 150 people have been killed, and 150,000 Sikhs have been  arrested.</p>
                      <p><img src="images\831107_1b.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="502" align="right" class="pictureright1">Located on the Pakistani border, Pun­jab  is one of India's  most strategic states. It is also the wealthiest agricultural re­gion,  supplying the nation with 80% of its wheat. Yet when it comes to industrial de­velopment,  claim the Sikhs, the govern­ment consistently slights them. Sikh mod­erates  would be appeased by an increase in state power a small radical minority,  however, is determined to fight for an en­tirely separate state called  Khalistan. So far, more than 100,000 Sikhs, known as the Akali Dal (Action  Party) &quot;Sacrifice Squad.&quot; have sworn to lay down their lives in the  present struggle.</p>
                      <p>Gandhi has declared that she is  ready and willing to negotiate with the dissi­dents. But the two most powerful  Sikh leaders, both hiding out within the Gold­en Temple,  scoff at such claims. While deploring the recent terrorism, Sant Har­chand  Singh Longowal, 51, the moderate president of the Akali, remains convinced that  the government has been increasing tension rather than soothing it. &quot;If  anyone is to blame for the terrorists' presence,&quot; he told TIME, &quot;it  is the central government.&quot; His more fanatical colleague, Militant  Fundamentalist Sant Jarnail Singh Bhin­dranwale, 36, voices a common suspicion  that Gandhi is exploiting the friction in order to buoy her popularity before  the next election.</p>
                      <p>The violence has shattered centuries  of friendship between Sikhs and Hindus, and it is spreading. Three bombs have  al­ready exploded in Delhi, and last week, in Punjab's neighboring state of Haryana, Hindu mobs began  storming Sikh-owned shops. With neither side giving way. ten­sions seem sure to  mount. In the ominous words of senior Akali Leader Prakash Singh Badal,  &quot;The central government has already taken the Punjab  problem to the point of no return.&quot;</p>
