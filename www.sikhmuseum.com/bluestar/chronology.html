                      <p>A situation which could have been resolved without a shot being  fired was allowed to deteriorate to the point where the sacred sanctity of a  place of worship was desecrated in the most brutal way with death and destruction. In addition to  the   followers of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, thousands of innocent pilgrims  who had gathered to celebrate a religious festival also lost their lives in the attack.                      </p>
                      <p>The Akal  Takht, the symbolic seat of supreme Sikh temporal authority was reduced to  rubble. Gurdwara Darbar Sahib was damaged with over 300 bullets. The Sikh  Reference Library with precious hand written manuscripts of the Gurus was  burned to the ground. The Temple  treasury Toshakhana with priceless historical artifacts of Maharaja Ranjit  Singh was also burned. </p>

                      <p><strong>Tuesday           May 25th</strong><br>
100,000 Indian Army troops are mobilized and deployed throughout Punjab           surrounding all important Gurdwars including the Golden Temple complex.
                      <p> <strong>Friday             June 1st</strong><br>
                                Thousands of pilgrims start to gather at the Golden Temple complex to             celebrate the martyrdom anniversary of Guru Arjan on June 3rd. </p>
                              <p> As Sant Jarnail Singh Bindranwale             sits on the roof of the Langer hall, police snipers open fire on him.             They miss and Sikh militants fired back. A seven hour skirmish during             the night lasting until the morning leaves 11 dead and 25 injured. There             were bullet holes in the Langer building, in the marble pavement (parkarma)             surrounding the Golden Temple and in the Golden Temple itself. </p>
                              <p> <strong>Sunday             June 3rd</strong><br>
                                All communications including phone lines to and from Punjab are cut.             Road blocks prevent anyone from entering or leaving Punjab and all journalists             are expelled from Punjab. A total curfew is imposed and as many as 10,000             pilgrims are trapped inside the temple complex. </p>
                              <p> Milk vendors from             the villages who supply milk to the city of Amritsar are shot dead for             violating the curfew orders. </p>
                              <p> <strong>Monday             June 4th</strong><br>
                                The army starts firing on the temple complex and there is a gun battle             lasting 5 hours. Using machine guns and mortars the army fires at dissident             positions atop the two 18th century towers called Ramgarhia Bunga's,             and the water tank behind Teja Singh Samundri Hall as well as surrounding             buildings. At least 100 are killed on both sides. </p>
                              <p> <strong>Tuesday             June 5th</strong><br>
                                At 7:00 p.m. Operation Blue Star, the invasion of The Golden Temple             begins with tanks of the 16th Cavalry Regiment of the Indian Army moving             to enclose the Golden Temple complex. Troops are briefed not to use             their guns against the Golden Temple itself or the Akal Takht. Artillery             is used to blast off the tops of the Ramgarhia Bungas and the water             tank. Scores of buildings in and around the temple complex are blazing.             One artillery shell lands more than 5 km away in the crowded city. </p>
                              <p> In the narrow alley             behind the Akal Takht paramilitary commandos try to get into the temple.             Some make it to the roof but are turned back due to the heavy gunfire.             Meanwhile tanks move into the square in front of the northern entrance             to the Golden Temple known as the clock tower entrance. </p>
                              <p> At 10:30 pm commandos             from the 1st Battalion, the Parachute Regiment try to run down the steps             under the clock tower onto the marble parkarma around the sacred pool.             They face heavy gunfire, suffering casualties and are forced to retreat.             A second wave of commandos manage to neutralize the machine gun posts             on either side of the steps and get down to the parkarma. </p>
                              <p> The Akal Takht             is heavily fortified with sandbags and brick gun emplacements in its             windows and arches. From here and the surrounding buildings the dissidents             are able to fire at any commandos who make their way in front of the             Gurdwara. </p>
                              <p> Two companies of             the 7th Garhwal Rifles enter the temple complex from the opposite side             on the southern gate entrance and after a gun battle are able to establish             a position on the roof of the Temple library. They are reinforced by             two companies of the 15th Kumaons. Repeated unsuccessful attempts are             made to storm the Akal Takht. </p>
                              <p> <strong>Wednesday             June 6th</strong><br>
                                After midnight tanks are used to break down the steps leading to the             parkarma from the hostel side and an 8-wheeled Polish-built armored             personnel carrier makes it's way towards the Akal Takht. It is destroyed             by a Chinese-made rocket propelled grenade launcher. </p>
                              <p> Six or more Vijayanta             tanks enter the temple complex crushing the delicate marble inlays of             the parkarma and plow their way towards the Akal Takht. Orders arrive             and the tanks start firing their large 105mm cannons equipped with high             explosive squash-head shells into the Akal Takht. These shells are designed             for hard targets like armour and fortifications. When the shells his             a target, their heads spread or squash on the hard surface. Their fuses             are arranged to allow a short delay between the impact and the shells             igniting, so that a shock-wave passes through the target and a heavy             slab of armour or masonry is forced away from the inside of the target             armour or fortification. </p>
                              <p> The effect on the             Akal Takht, the most sacred of the five Takhts, is devastating. Over             80 shells are pumped into the sacred Gurdwara. The entire front of the             Takht is destroyed and fires break out in many of the different rooms             blackening the marble walls and wrecking the delicate decorations dating             back to the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Marble inlays, plaster and             mirror work, filigree partitions and priceless old wall paintings are             all destroyed. </p>
                              <p> The gold dome of             the Akal Takht is also badly damaged by artillery fire. At one stage             a 3.7 inch Howitzer gun is mounted on the roof of a building behind the             shrine and fired a number of times at the beautiful dome. </p>
                              <p> At the other end             of the Temple complex on the easternmost side a battalion of the Kumaon             Regiment were invading the hostel complex where many of the innocent             pilgrims were in hiding as well as the temple administration staff.             There was no water because the water tower had been destroyed and it             was very hot. </p>
                              <p> <em>(Bhan Singh,             Secretary of S.G.P.C.)<br>
  &quot;They cut our electricity and water supplies. It was very hot in the             rooms. There was no water. We had only two plastic buckets of water.             Longowal had to place two people as guards over the buckets. Many people             would squeeze their undershirts to drink their sweat to quench their             thirst.&quot;</em> </p>
                              <p> Around 1:00 am             the Army entered the hostel and administrative buildings and ordered             everyone out and made them sit in the courtyard of the Guru Ram Das             Hostel. There were about 250 people who came out. </p>
                              <p><em>Prithipal Singh (Sevadar, Akal Rest  House)<br>
&quot;  At 2 a.m. on June 6 the Army people came to the Rest House.  They tore off all my clothes, stripped me naked, my kirpan was snatched, my  head gear (patta) was untied to tie up my hands behind my back. They caught me  by my hair and took me along with five others - who were all pilgrims - to the  ruins of the water tank, there we were told, &quot;don't move or you'll be  shot.&quot; They kept hitting us with the rifle butts. Then a Major came and  ordered a soldier, shoot them, then shouted at us, &quot;You must be  Bhindranwale's Chelas? You want Khalistan? I said &quot;I am here to do my  duty. I have nothing to do with all this.&quot; &quot;Six of us were in a line  facing the Major, when a Pahari soldier started shooting from one end, killing  four of us (with 3 bullets each). As my turn was coming, suddenly a Sikh  Officer turned up and ordered, &quot;Stop Shooting&quot;. Thus I was saved.”</em></p>
                      <p> <em>(Bhan Singh)<br>
  &quot;Suddenly there was a big explosion. All hell broke loose. It was pitch             dark. People started running back into the verandah and the rooms. I             and Abhinashi Singh were sitting next to Gurcharan Singh, the former             Secretary of the Akali Dal whom Bhindranwale accused of murdering Sodhi.             Gurcharan was shot as he tried to run inside. We realized that soldiers             were shooting at us. They thought someone from among the crowd had exploded             the grenade. But it was probably thrown by extremists on the water tank             overlooking the Guru Ram Das Serai (Hostel). We ran to Tohra's room             and told Longowal what was happening. Longowal came out and shouted             at the Major. He said, 'Don't shoot these people. They are not extremists.             They are employees of the S.G.P.C.' The Major then ordered his men to             stop shooting. Later in the morning we counted at least seventy dead             bodies in the compound. There were women and children too.&quot;</em> </p>
                              <p> Among the dead             were 35 women and 5 children. The survivors were made to sit in the             courtyard of the Guru Ram Das Hostel until curfew was lifted the next             evening. They were not given any food, water or medical aid. People             drank whatever water was in puddles in the courtyard from the blown             up water tank. </p>
                              <p> <em>(Karnail Kaur,             mother of 3 young children)<br>
  &quot;When people begged for water some soldiers told them to drink the mixture             of blood and urine on the ground.&quot;</em> </p>
                              <p> Many of the young             men in the group of innocent unarmed civilians were then shot by the             soldiers. </p>
                              <p> <em>(Bhan Singh)<br>
  &quot;I saw about 35 or 36 Sikhs lined up with their hands raised above their             heads. And the major was about to order them to be shot. When I asked             him for medical help, he got into a rage, tore my turban off my head,             and ordered his men to shoot me. I turned back and fled, jumping over             the bodies of the dead and injured, and saving my life crawling along             the walls. I got to the room where Tohra and Sant Longowal were sitting             and told them what I had seen. Sardar Karnail Singh Nag, who had followed             me, also narrated what he had seen, as well as the killing of 35 to             36 young Sikhs by cannon fire. All of these young men were villagers.&quot;</em> </p>
                              <p> <em>(Ranbir Kaur,             School Teacher)<br>
  &quot;Early on the sixth morning the army came into the Guru Ram Das Serai             and ordered all of those in the rooms to come out. We were taken into             the courtyard. The men were separated from the women. We were also divided             into old and young women and I was separated from the children, but             I managed to get back to the old women. When we were sitting there the             army released 150 people from the basement. They were asked why they             had not come out earlier. They said the door had been locked from the             outside. They were asked to hold up their hands and then they were shot             after 15 minutes. Other young men were told to untie their turbans.             They were used to tie their hands behind their backs. The army hit them             on the head with the butts of their rifles.&quot;</em> </p>
                              <p> <em>(Sujjan Singh             Margindpuri)<br>
  &quot;The young men and some other pilgrims were staying in Room Number 61.             The army searched all the rooms of the Serai. Nothing objectionable             was found from their room. Nor did the army find anything objectionable             on their persons. The army locked up 60 pilgrims in that room and shut             not only the door but the window also. Electric supply was disconnected.             The night between June 5th and June 6th was extremely hot. The locked-in             young men felt very thirsty after some time, and loudly knocked on the             door from inside to ask the army men on duty for water. They got abuses             in return, but no water. The door was not opened. Feeling suffocated             and extremely thirsty, the men inside began to faint and otherwise suffer             untold misery. The door of the room was opened at 8 am on June 6th.             By this time 55 out of the 60 had died. The remaining 5 were also semi-dead.&quot;</em> </p>
                              <p> By morning light,             there is only sporadic sniper fire from the rubble of the Akal Takht.             By late afternoon the army was firmly in control of the Temple complex             and curfew was lifted for two hours to allow people who were still in             hiding to come out. </p>
                              <p> (Giani Puran Singh)<br>
                                  <em>&quot;I went to the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) on 5th June around             7:30 in the evening because I had to ensure that religious ceremonies             were performed. The moment I stepped on to the parkarma I stumbled across             a body. Bullets were flying and I had to take shelter behind each and             every pillar to reach the Darshani Deorhi. Another body was lying there.             I ran a few yards and reached the Akal Takht. Night prayers start at             Harmandir Sahib five minutes after they start at the Akal Takht. I wanted             to find out if the path (recitation) had started there. I had a glimpse             of Bhindranwale. We did not speak to each other. Around 7:45 I came             out of the Akal Takht and ran into the Darshani Deorhi. I ran towards             Harmandir Sahib, unmindful of the bullets flying past my ears. I began             night prayers. Soon a colleague of mine, Giani Mohan Singh, joined me.             Seeing the intensity of the fire we decided to close all the doors,             barring the front door. Soon we completed all religious rites. We then             took the Guru Granth Sahib to the top room to prevent any damage to             the holy book. The Head Priest, Giani Sahib Singh, had given clear instructions             that under no circumstances was the Guru Granth Sahib to be taken to             the Akal Takht if the conditions were not right. </em> </p>
                              <p><em> Looking through             the window-pane from the first floor of the Harmandir Sahib, I saw a             tank standing on the parkarma with its lights on. I thought for a moment             that it was the fire brigade come to collect water from the srowar (holy             pool) to put out the fire which was raging in almost every room. A few             minutes later my belief was shattered when I saw the vehicle emitting             fire instead of putting it out. By 10:30 or so around 13 tanks had collected             on the parkarma. They had come after crushing the staircase from the             eastern wing where Guru Ram Das Serai, the Langer and the Teja Singh             Samundari Hall are situated. One after another the cannon fire lit the             sky. When the first shell hit the bottom of the Darshani Deorhi, creating             a hole in it, I saw the room with the historic chandni (canopy) presented             by Maharaja Ranjit Singh catching fire. One after another the big bombs             hit the Darshani Deorhi in quick succession, and what was once a lovely             building was now on fire. The Toshakhana (Treasury) was also on fire.             Occasionally a bullet would hit the Harmandir Sahib. We were 27 people             inside, mostly ragis (singers) and sevadars (temple servants).</em> </p>
                              <p><em> In the early             hours of the morning of 6th June we took the holy book down and performed             the religious rites that are performed every day, like maharaj da prakash             karna (unfolding the holy book) and reciting hymns from the scriptures.             The two side-doors were closed and the front and back doors were open.             Bullets kept hitting the wall both inside and outside, ripping off the             gold surface at various places. Soon after we finished reciting prayers             one of our colleagues, Ragi Avtar Singh was hit. We pulled him into             a corner. Another bullet came and hit the holy Granth Sahib. We have             preserved this book.</em> </p>
                              <p><em> In the meanwhile             the pounding of the Akal Takht was continuing. There was no let-up in             the fire in other places either.

                                  <em>&quot;On the fifth night, the night of the real assault, mortars started             throwing up plaster. My wife and I and my two daughters decided to go             down from our flat on the first floor to the office, which is on the             ground floor. At this point I thought of surrendering but I was told             by a Bhindranwale man, 'One more step outside the complex and you are             a dead man'. Faced with this threat to my entire family plus the insecurity             of the office room, I decided to move down to a small basement where             there was a fridge. An exhaust fan outlet in the basement proved a life             saver. I could hear soldiers speaking outside and different instructions             from their commanders. Next to the basement was another cubicle facing             the Temple where a sewadar used to sleep. I heard the army drag out             this man. He was shot. Since extremists had been using all possible             openings as pill boxes and grenade launchers the soldiers decided to             lob grenades into all such openings, including my fan outlet. The minute             I heard the order we all moved under a staircase. Minutes later two             grenades came in. The splinters took three inches away from most of             the walls. But luckily we escaped. We spent the night under the staircase.             Eventually at about 11 am on the 6th my wife noticed an officer standing             outside. She called out to him to attract his attention and requested             him to rescue us. She told him that she had two young daughters. The             officer behaved decently and said, 'Don't worry I too have two daughters.             Nothing will happen to you. Stay put.' He organized chapattis, pickles             and drinking water. He eventually let us out when curfew lifted. </em> </p>
                              <p><em> We had to step             over dead bodies strewn everywhere. We were taken to the square in front             of the main clock tower entrance. The minute the soldiers saw me, a             male member of the group, they positioned their rifles on their shoulders             with the barrels pointing at me. I think they were about to shoot me             when a brigadier who recognized me intervened. We were then led by soldiers             across the parkarma to the library side. A lieutenant accompanied us.             Upon reaching the other side he asked me to stand against the wall and             lined up a firing squad. He asked me to say my prayers. I requested             to say good-bye to my wife and the two daughters. At this point the             brigadier showed up again and shouted at the young officer, 'What the             hell are you doing!' The officer said, 'Sir, I misunderstood your order.             I thought this man was to be shot.'</em> </p>
                              <p><em> Now we were             made to sit on the ground. My hands were tied behind my back. We were             about 70 in that lot. All of us were told to keep our heads down. A             slight movement of the head resulted in a sharp rifle butt. We spent             the whole night sitting there.&quot;</em> </p>
                              <p> Outside the Temple             complex the army troops were on a  rampage, killing and looting             surrounding houses of Sikhs. </p>
                      <p> <em>(Subhash Kirpekar,             Journalist)<br>
  &quot;On the way back to the hotel (afternoon of June 6th) I witnessed a             scene at the Kotwali which is blood curdling. This is where some soldiers             were kicking some of the 11 suspected terrorists as they knelt on their             bare knees and crawled on the hot road surface.&quot;</em> </p>
                              <p> <em>(Giani Chet             Singh)<br>
  &quot;The people were taken out of their houses. Men's hands were tied with             their turbans. Women's necks were sought to be asphyxiated with their             plaits. Then they were shot in the chests. No quarter was shown to women,             aged or children; in the eyes of the troops every Sikh was a terrorist.             Those who survived died of thirst. Their houses were ransacked, and             then put on fire. The area surrounding Darbar Sahib (Golden Temple)             was full of debris. What happened is beyond description of sight, hearing             or words.&quot;</em> </p>
                              <p> As night fell the             Army troops were given the order to storm the remains of the Akal Takht             and shoot on site anyone they found inside. The troops encounter little             resistance and find dead bodies and the smell of death everywhere. </p>
                              <p> <strong>Thursday             June 7th</strong><br>
                                In the early hours of the morning the troops discover the bodies of             Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his closest followers in the basement of the Akal Takht. </p>
                              <p><em>(Apar Singh Bajwa, SP of Punjab Police)<br>                              &quot;The Army officers in-charge ordered me to go home and I remained there until the morning of June 6 when I was summoned early in the morning. When I reached the kotwali [police station] near the temple, I saw the dead bodies of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, Gen. Shabeg Singh, Thiara Singh and Amrik Singh lying there...I was asked to identify the bodies because I was familiar with all the dead men having often interacted with them as part of my duties as a police officer. The Army then requested me to arrange the cremations. We performed these, according to Sikh rites, at the nearby Gurudwara Shaheedan...A large majority of those who died inside the Golden Temple during Operation Bluestar were common devotees who had come to the shrine on June 3 on the occasion of the fifth Guru’s Martyrdom Day...Apart from Bhindranwale’s armed followers, I counted a little over 800 dead bodies inside the temple complex. My men and I were also tasked with clearing and cremating these bodies. Army and municipal officials helped transport them to the local cremation ground. While many innocents were killed in the crossfire between the Army and the militants, it is also true that the soldiers deliberately gunned down several devotees. You see they actually believed that anyone inside the temple was the ‘enemy.’ The soldiers had no notion of how they should tackle an unprecedented situation like the one that had developed inside the Golden Temple.&quot;</em> </p>
                      <p> The day was spent             in clean up operations flushing out any remaining snipers and collecting             the dead bodies. Soldiers were openly walking about the temple in their             shoes, drinking alcohol as well as smoking. Blood and bodies were strewn             all over the broken marble of the parkarma. With putrefying corpses             floating in the sacred pool of nectar and the smell of death everywhere. </p>
                              <p> The Darshani Deori             the entrance gate of the Golden Temple which houses many priceless treasures             was destroyed and looted. Although fighting had now died down, the central             library complex was mysteriously burned down. Many priceless manuscripts,             some in the Gurus own handwriting were lost forever. </p>

                    <p><span class="headline1">Aftermath</span></p>
                    <p>The number of people             who lost their lives will never be known. The Army refused to let the             Red Cross enter the complex and cremated the dead before the bodies             could be identified or claimed by their families. The Amritsar municipal             sweepers refused to clear the dead bodies away but were eventually persuaded             by offers of rum and being allowed to strip the bodies of all valuables.             They piled the dead into garbage trucks and unceremoniously cremated             them. Family members were not allowed by the army to claim the remains             or perform any traditional funeral rites. It is clear that thousands             lost their lives in the Temple complex. </p>

As many as 50,000 Sikhs were left homeless as their houses were burned to the ground.</p>

                      Report  for the Committee on Disappearances in Punjab <br>
  <em>On  13 December 1991, Sukhwinder Singh  accompanied by Lakhwinder Singh went to Munda Pind village on a tractor trolly  to do some shopping. While returning, they were apprehended by the police of  Munda Pind police post and handed over to Goindwal Sahib police. SHO Tegh  Bahadur of Goindwal Sahib Police station and head constable Rachhpal Singh  personally supervised Sukhwinder’s interrogation under torture during the  course of his illegal detention for five days. The family members regularly  visited him in the police station and served him food. Gian Singh met his son  at Goindwal police station for the last time on 16   December 1991. Gian Singh, along with several other village elders had  been talking to SHO Tegh Bahadur Singh to get Sukhwinder released from his  custody. The SHO demanded a bribe of Rs 200,000 for Sukhwinder’s release. Gian  Singh, a small farmer, was unable to raise such a large amount and beseeched the  SHO to release his son for Rs. 50,000 but the SHO turned down the offer. Gian  Singh was still struggling to raise the amount, demanded by the SHO for his  son’s release when on 19 December 1991, several Punjabi  newspapers reported the killing of Sukhwinder Singh and another unidentified  militant in a supposed armed encounter with the police force. The cremation was  carried out without the family’s knowledge.</em></p>
