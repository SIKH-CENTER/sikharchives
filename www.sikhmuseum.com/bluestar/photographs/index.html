                      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">During Operation Blue Star Indian army photographers took photographs of the military operation and it's immediate aftermath. Thousands of photographs were taken but have never been released to the public. All independent and foreign journalists were also expelled from Punjab. One high ranking Indian Army officer made the fateful decision to get a roll of film with Blue Star photographs that he had taken developed by a local camera shop. Realizing what they were looking at, the shop owners made a secret copy of those prints. Second and third generation copies of those copies were then smuggled out of India and form the only existing photographs of the military operation and conditions in the Darbar Sahib complex during and immediately after the initial combat phase of Operation Blue Star.</font></p>
                          <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As the state of digital imaging technology has advanced over the years and working with a set of early generation images some of the clearest high resolution images from that one roll of film can now be seen online. These photographs have been combined with rare images of the Akal Takht before it's destruction, including seldom seen images of the original Akal Takht interior and rare artwork now lost. To provide a better contextual frame of reference when viewing the army photographs, contemporary photographs of the same buildings from relatively similar vantage points are also included. </font></p>

		    <h4><div class="slideno">Image 9 of 43</div>"I have one appeal to make to you too. The police are making preparations to come here. If you get word [of such a thing happening] don't just stay asleep in the villages. Don't be the first to attack anyone but don't let any attack go unresponded. When you hear that the police have entered here, just assume your responsibility wherever you are. Chhalli Rams (Hindus) are only twenty to each one of you. Stay upbeat. Some even say that they (the police) will pick me up and take me away. May God have mercy. They will know only when they make that attempt. We shall take care of a hundred thousand of them at the first assault. By then you will wake up too. I do not mean that after doing away with a hundred thousand we shall go to sleep, it is only that first count that I have given you.." (Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, April 1, 1984)</h4>
