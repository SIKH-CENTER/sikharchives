           Who built the lost palace?<br>
           Explore an interesting cast of characters       </p>
       </div>
       <p>From its origins in the last years of Maharaja Ranjit  Singh rule to the end of the Sikh Empire, the lost palace continued to serve  its intended purpose as a palatial residence or bunga on the parkarma of the  sacred pool at Amritsar. Its occupants would have had a spectacular view of  the Darbar Sahib and the sacred pool of nectar. One of the most famous painting of the lost palace,  August Schoeffts epic scene of Maharaja Ranjit Singh at Darbar Sahib was  painted during this era.</p>
       <p>With the end of the Sikh Empire and its annexation by the  British in 1849, European artist and then photographers started appearing in  Punjab and visiting Darbar Sahib at Amritsar, an area that only a handful had  ever seen before during the time of the Sikh Empire. The 1850&rsquo;s would see the  very first photographs of Darbar Sahib by Felice Beato and the  popular  paintings of Darbar Sahib by artist William Carpenter. These early  images of Darbar Sahib featuring the lost palace help provide a record of the lost palace before it disappeared from the pages of  history and memory.</p>
       <p>The loss of influence over Amritsar with British rule also  ment that Sikhs lost control over the use of the lost palace. , The history of  the lost palace would now take a drastic turn with the palace would now be symbolic  of a new era of colonial  government administration featuring a disregard for the religious and cultural  sensitivities of the 'natives'.</p>
       <p>The lost palace, located on the &lsquo;pool of nectar&rsquo; at  Amritsar, an area representing the spiritual heartland of the Sikh religion was  now occupied by the Christian missionaries of the Amritsar Mission School [1].  Although Sikhs are well known for their religious tolerance, this invasion of  the spiritual sanctity of the Darbar Sahib complex by an  organization dedicated to the conversion of Sikhs to Christianity represented a  complete lack of religious sensitivity by the British administrators.</p>
       <p>In its final years things would take an even more bizarre turn as the lost palace would be used as a police station with a prison and court house. </p>
       <div class="body_indent1">
         <p><em>The  Kutwallee - This building, used as a prision and Court House, was built by Mr.  Saunders, Collector of Umritser, and is one of the few English buildings in  India which do not look out of place among their native neighbours. It is  situated on the borders of the Tank, opposite the Holy Temple, and is  constantly haunted by beggars; the applications for baksheesh, or bounty, being  indeed most inconveniently, and through their importunity annoyingly,  multiplied through all the neighbourhood of the Holy Tank. The deformities  exhibited also to stimulate charity are very shocking.</em><br>
           Original  Sketches in the Punjaub by a Lady<br>
           Dickinson Bros. London, ca. 1854</p>
       </div>
       <p>This account by the wife of a British officer stationed  at Amritsar accompanies a  detailed sketch by her of the lost palace.  She erroneously attributes the construction of the lost palace to a British  administrator, but we know from August Schoefft&rsquo;s painting that the lost palace  already existed in the time of Maharaja Sher Singh before British rule.</p>
       <p>Why the British felt a need to convert a palace on the  sacred pool of nectar into a police station is odd and difficult to  explain. In the entire city of Amritsar could they not have chosen a more  appropriate location rather than at the Sikh spiritual center of Darbar Sahib?</p>
       <p>A travel account by William Knight of a visit to Darbar  Sahib in October 1860 provides one of the last known references to the lost  palace prior to its destruction.</p>
       <div class="body_indent1">
         <p><em>October  22. - Out at four A.M. to explore the great durbar, or head-quarters of the  Sikh religion in the Punjab. Entering through a highly decorated archway in the  kotwalee, or police-station, we came upon an enormous tank, with steps  descending into the water on all sides, and planted around with large and shady  tree…After this we repaired to the kotwalee again, and, getting a pair of  slippers in exchange for our boots, descended to the durbar and mingled with  the crowd.<br>
           </em>Diary  of a Pedestrian in Cashmere and Thibet<br>
           William Henry Knight, London, 1863</p>
       </div>
       <p>         Knights  provides additional important information  indicating that during this time period the palace served as one of the main  entrances to the Darbar Sahib complex, complete with a depository for shoes. </p>
       <p>Knight also mentions that the palace had a  archway  leading to the parkarma which was covered with decorative paintings. These  paintings would likely have been portraits of the Gurus and scenes from Sikh  history. Although now a police station, the paintings and the archway would  have harkened back to an earlier time when the structure had served as a  palace. <a name="slideshowdown" id="slideshowdown"></a><br>

                    <p>In Schoefft's iconic and famous painting the lost palace dominates the background appearing on the left side of the painting.  Schoefft's image is invaluable because of the high vantage point and angle that it is painted from, revealing a significant number of details not visible in other ground-level views of the lost palace. </p>

                    <p>The simple rounded curves of the main palace arches on top of multiple columns contrast with the ornate arch of the building to the left of the palace. In the second archway from the left can be seen an soldier wearing a red coat standing at attention. Given his scale this indicated that the main arches were between 15 to 20 feet high. A large open second floor veranda extending the length of the building with doorways and arches. A group of people on the veranda enjoy a spectacular view. Another smaller veranda on a third floor is also visible higher up.</p>

                    <p>The palace front façade but a beautiful and unusual intersection of linear and semi-circular curves. The elevation of the palace above the ground level of the parkarma can be seen with a series of steps from the parkarma leading up to the palace extend along the entire length of the palace. Only the first minaret column on the left edge of the palace has its dome on top intact. The second minaret column which is also visible in Schoeffts painting now appears flat on top indicating that its dome top may have collapsed. A third similar column on the right also no longer has a dome on top. Amritsar is in a known earthquake zone, which may explain the missing domes. In the great Kangra earthquake of April 1905, the domes on both Ramgharia Bunga towers collapsed.</p>

                    <p>British photographer Felice Beato took the earliest known photographs of the Darbar Sahib complex in the late 1850's. This photograph of the Darshani Deori gateway and the Lachi Ber tree in front of it where Guru Arjan used to sit also shows a section of the lost palace behind and to the right edge of the frame. We are fortunate to have this important photographic evidence as the majority of photographs of the Darbar Sahib complex date to the late 1860's onwards, a time period when the lost palace had already been demolished by the British.</p>

                    <p>An unusual view of the entire Darbar Sahib complex combining two dimensional and three dimensional perspectives. The lost palace appears as the largest structure of its kind on the entire parkarma surrounding the sacred pool.</p>

                    <p>Notice that the white marble pavement stops in front of the palace. This correctly dates the painting as work on paving the Parkarma was a decades long project  first started under Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1837, continued by his successors and then various Sikh administrators under British rule.</p>

                    <p>An interesting and unusual plan view of the Darbar Sahib complex. The lost palace appears in the lower right hand side of the parkarma. Comparing this to the previous perspective view of the complex we can see that the entire parkarma has now been paved. This helps date this painting to the late 19th century. The artist likely copied an older painting showing existing structures including the lost palace, but updating the image by including the newly paved marble parkarma along the temple perimeter.</p>
