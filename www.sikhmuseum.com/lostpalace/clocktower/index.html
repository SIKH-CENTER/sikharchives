       <p class="headline1">A British Vision</p>
       <p>Under  British rule  came a new vision for  Amritsar. This new  era featured an exertion of European cultural imperialism marked  by the tragic demolition of the lost palace by British authorities and the construction  of a large   gothic style clock tower in its place to dominate over Darbar Sahib  and the Amritsar skyline.</p>
       <p>Construction of the clock tower started in 1862 and work  on the project would continue for over a decade until eventually completed in  1874 [1] at a cost of over Rs. 50,000. [2] Although a clock tower traditionally  has a small base, it was decided that the lost palace and all other buildings  in the area would be demolished during construction to create a large open  courtyard around the new clock tower.</p>
       <p>The clock tower was designed by John Gordon, the Municipal  Chief Engineer of Amritsar. [3] Unlike some other British buildings  in their Indian empire where elements of  eastern architecture were sometimes incorporated, the new clock tower was designed entirely  in the traditional European gothic style with red bricks. [4]</p>
       <div class="body_indent1">
         <p><em>The  Clock Tower at Amritsar now in course of erection, at an estimated cost of  23,000 rupees ; the style adopted in this building is the decorated Gothic. The  ornamentation, though simple, is very effective, and the proportions are  singularly graceful. It is proposed to place in it a clock with illuminated  dials, and as it is situated on the highest ground in Amritsar, and is itself  145 feet in height, it will be a very prominent object in the city.</em><br>
           Hand-book  of the Manufactures &amp; Arts of the Punjab, Volume II<br>
           B.H. Baden Powell, Lahore, 1872</p>
       </div>
       <p>The clock tower was initially designed by the authorities  as part of a master plan to be facing a Town Hal [5]. Although wisely deciding  to relocate the Town Hall to another section of the city, work on the clock  tower continued. The construction of the gothic clock tower and the demolition  of the lost palace met with serious disapproval from the Sikhs [6], but the British  ignored this and moved forward with their project. While Guru Arjan had Darbar  Sahib built on the lowest elevation in the city as a mark of Sikh humility, at  145 feet the gothic clock tower completely dominated the sacred space of Darbar  Sahib and the surrounding landscape of Amritsar. </p>
       <div class="body_indent1">
         <p><em>But there is one incongruity, one slightly jarring  note, and that is the obtrusive brick clock-tower which dominates the enclosure  at the entrance. Built in a style which might be termed Early New England  Gothic, it must have reminded many an American wanderer of the fire-engine  house in his native village, or the ambitious but inexpensive church-tower of  sanded wood. Far from being intended as a gratuitous insult to the Sikhs, it  was most probably a generous donation on the part of the European community,  meant to serve as a perpetual object-lesson in architecture, and as a dignified  protest against barbaric excess of ornament.</em><br>
           From the Black Sea through Persia and India<br>
           Edwin Lord Weeks, New York, 1896</p>
       </div>
       <p>Although there have been some suggestions that the clock tower was really built by the British as a church, photographic evidence indicates that it only had a weather vane at its pinnacle and not a cross. Also the interior chamber was a relatively small room of approximately 20ft by 20ft, not a very large or practical space for congregations or church services.</p>
       <p>Looking completely out of place at Darbar Sahib the clock  tower was an eye sore and much hated by the Sikhs yet it would endure for over  70 years. <a name="slideshowdown" id="slideshowdown"></a></p>

                    <p>An aerial view of the Darbar Sahib complex photographed from the Baba Atal tower. The photograph emphasizes the visual dominance of the gothic clock tower over the landscape of Darbar Sahib and Amritsar as well as its complete mismatch with the surrounding architecture. It is interesting to compare this photograph to the one taken by Felice Beato 30 years earlier from the same vantage point which features the lost palace.</p>

                    <p>An elevated view of the gothic clock tower photographed from the roof of Darbar Sahib. An important view as it allows us to see into the large courtyard where the lost palace once stood. The courtyard is not visible from ground level photographs of the clock tower due to the large wall separating it from the parkarma.</p>

The square inner chamber room would have been approximately 20 feet in length and width, a relatively small room. The gateway between the clock tower courtyard and the parkarma can be seen behind the Ber Baba Buddha tree to the left.</p>
