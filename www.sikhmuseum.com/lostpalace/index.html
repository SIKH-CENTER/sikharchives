<p class="headline1">The Bungas of Darbar Sahib</p>
<p>As a spiritual and inspirational hub of Sikhism The Darbar Sahib complex in the city of Amritsar has always been a very special place for Sikhs.</p>
<p>Surrounding the sacred pool of nectar at Darbar Sahib the leading members of the Sikh misls (confederacies)  first established their  residences and palaces (bungas) at Amritsar in the late 18th  century. After a dark period, Darbar Sahib was reconstruction in 1764  after  repeated destruction by Ahmad Shah Durrani and Sikhs began to  enjoy a period of relative peace in Punjab where they were no longer fighting for survival as a people. With the rise of Maharaja Ranjit Singhs empire and its prosperity, at  their height there were over 84 bungas around  the sacred pool. </p>
<div class="body_indent1">
  <p><em>In  the centre of the city of Umritsir is a gigantic reservoir of water, from the  midst of which rises a magnificent temple, where the Grunth ( the holy book of  the Sikhs ) is read day and night. Around this sheet of water are the houses of  the maharajah, the ministers, sirdars, and other wealthy inhabitants</em>.<br>

<p>Some of these palaces (bungas) were used as centers of religious  teaching and education while most served as the  residences of some of the powerful aind influential families of Punjab. Being on the  sacred pool these palaces offered an intimate view and connection with Darbar Sahib.</p>

  <p>Amritsar, 1859.<br>
    <em>In the centre of the tank rose a gorgeous temple of marble, the roof and minarets being encased in gilded metal; marble pavements, fresco paintings, added to the splendour of the scene, and round the outer circle sprung up a succession of stately buildings for the accommodation of the sovereign and his court. The establishment of no noble was complete, who had not his bhunga at Amritsar.</em><br>

Robert Needham Cust, London, 1880</p>
  <p><em>The  Tulao, or pool, struck me with surprise. It is about 150 paces square, and has  a large body of water, which to all appearance is supplied by a natural  artesian well. There are no sign of the spring to be seen. It is surrounded by  a pavement about 20 to 25 paces in breadth. Round this square are some of the  most considerable houses of the city, and some buildings belonging to the  temple, the whole being inclosed by gates: although one can look very  conveniently from the windows of the houses into this inclosed space, and some  of the doors even open into it.</em><br>

<p>Over time eventually almost all of the bungas have disappeared, being replaced by new structures;  today the only two remaining bungas are the Akal Takht (Akal Bunga) and the twin  towers of the Ramgharia Bunga. Although they are long gone, the palaces (bungas) of Amritsar live on in memory and are  still remembered every day in the common Sikh prayer of Ardas:</p>

    May  the bungas, the banners, the cantonments abide from age to age. May the cause  of truth and justice prevail everywhere at all times, utter, Wondrous God!.</em></p>
