          <p><img src="images\guru5.jpg" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru 
          Arjan was the youngest son of Guru Ram Das and Mata Bhani. He was 
          born at Goindwal on April 15, 1563. In 1579 Guru Arjan was eventually 
          married to Ganga Devi daughter of Krishan Chand in 1579.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Eventually Arjan 
            was invested with the Guruship by his father Guru Ram Das in 1581 
            as narrated previously. Guru Arjan now left Goindwal for Ramdaspur (Amritsar) 
            to complete the work started there by his father and to get away from 
            his jealous older brother Prithi Chand. Guru Arjan completed the 
            two tanks of Santoksar and Amritsar and undertook the expansion of Ramdaspur. 
            </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Guru laid the 
              foundation of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in the middle of the 
              tank of Amritsar. All of the Sikhs desired that it should be the tallest 
              building in the new town. Guru Arjan however felt otherwise. He 
              reminded his followers that humility should be a great virtue. The temple 
              was therefore built on as low an elevation as possible. To counter the 
              Muslim belief that God's House is in the west and the Hindu belief that 
              it is in the east where the sun rises, the Harmandir Sahib had entrances 
              on all four sides. Guru Arjan exclaimed; "My faith is for the people 
              of all castes and all creeds from whichever direction they come and 
              to whichever direction they bow." To help raise money for these monumental 
              public works projects, the Guru declared that all Sikhs should donate 
              1/10th of their earnings to charity.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Around the year 
                1590 Guru Arjan decided to go on an extensive tour of Punjab accompanied 
                by such trusted Sikhs as Bhai Gurdas and Bidhi Chand. He visited Khadur, 
                Goindwal, Sarhali, Bhaini, Khanpur, Taran Taran, Lahore, Dera Baba Nanak, 
                as well as Barath where he met the aged ascetic son of Guru Nanak, Baba 
                Sri Chand. Guru Arjan also purchased some land near Jullundur and 
                laid the foundations of a new township called Kartarpur as well as digging 
                a well called Ganga Sagar.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Guru eventually 
                  returned to Amritsar to find his eldest brother Prithi Chand jealous 
                  as ever. With the Guru having no children as yet, Prithi Chand hoped 
                  that his own son Mehrban would be able to succeed Guru Arjan as 
                  the next Guru. Guru Arjan in his humility asked his wife Ganga Devi; 
          "If you need a boon, ask not me but a pious Sikh like Baba Buddha, the 
                  aged seer and devout disciple of Guru Nanak". She proceeded with a large 
                  entourage and much fanfare to Baba Buddha who lived in a jungle near 
                  Amritsar. There she presented him with many delicacies to eat. Baba 
                  Buddha resented this and refused to provide any blessings. Upon hearing 
                  what happened, Guru Arjan told his wife to return this time on foot, 
                  with a simple meal prepared by herself. This time Baba Buddha was delighted 
                  and partook of the simple food. He prophesied; "A son will be born to 
                  thee who will crush the enemies of Nanak's house, just as I have crushed 
                  this piece of onion with my hand." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Soon thereafter 
                    Ganga Devi became pregnant. Prithi Chand meanwhile cultivated Sulhi 
                    Khan, a revenue officer of the Mughal court to raid Amritsar on the 
                    pretext of collecting a tribute. Guru Arjan along with his family 
                    left Amritsar and settled at Wadali a few miles away. It was here that 
                    on June 14, 1595 that the Guru was blessed with a son, Hargobind. The 
                    love of a father for his son can be seen in the following lines:</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"My True Guru 
                      is my Savior and Protector. Showering us with His Mercy and Grace, God 
                      extended His Hand, and saved Hargobind, who is now safe and secure. 
                      The fever is gone - God Himself eradicated it, and preserved the honor 
                      of His servant. I have obtained all blessings from the Saadh Sangat, 
                      the Company of the Holy; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru." (Guru Arjan 
                      Dev, Sorath, pg. 620)</i></font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Meanwhile Sulhi 
                        Khan upon hearing that both Guru Arjan and his treasure were no 
                        longer in Amritsar put off his attack on the city. In Amritsar Prithi 
                        Chand tried to convince the Sikhs that he was the real Guru and not 
                        Arjan Dev. He only met with disappointment though, as the Sikhs continued 
                        to flock to see Guru Arjan Dev. Prithi Chand therefore concocted a plan 
                        to assassinate the Guru's only child Hargobind. He sent a wet-nurse 
                        with poison, got a snake charmer to release a snake near Hargobind, 
                        and on another attempt sent a servant with poison milk. All of these 
                        attempts failed with the perpetrators all publicly confessing that Prithi 
                        Chand had sent them.</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"The poison 
                          had absolutely no harmful effect. But the wicked Brahmin died in pain. 
                          || 1 || The Supreme Lord God Himself has saved His humble servant. The 
                          sinner died through the Power of the Guru." (Guru Arjan Dev, Bhairon, 
                          pg. 1137)</i></font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Eventually a large 
                            delegation of Sikhs were able to convince the Guru to return to Amritsar.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Arjan now 
                              started the training for his son Hargobind for the responsibilities 
                              which he would one day have to face. He had the young Hargobind not 
                              only trained in languages and religious philosophy, but also in riding, 
                              the use of weapons, astronomy, medicine, agriculture, public administration 
                              and the sciences. Baba Buddha was put in charge of the religious education 
                              of the young Hargobind, while a team of experts were employed for instruction 
                              in their areas of expertise. Guru Arjan meanwhile kept quite busy 
                              attending to the spiritual needs of the large masses of Sikhs who came 
                              to see him daily. He would daily perform devotional music from the Harmandir 
                              Sahib, being a great instrumentalist and vocal singer.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A situation now 
                                arose which would require the Guru's complete attention. Reports came 
                                to the Guru that Prithi Chand was composing his own hymns and was passing 
                                them to the visiting Sikhs as the compositions of Guru Nanak as well 
                                as other Guru's. Others were also passing of their own compositions 
                                as the works of the Sikh Guru's. Guru Arjan realized that if this 
                                situation was allowed to continue it would be the undermining of the 
                                Sikh religion. Having given the Sikhs a central place of worship, they 
                                now needed an authentic compilation of the hymns of their Guru's. Thus 
                                Guru Amar Das started collection the original verses of all the Guru's. 
                                He sent trusted Sikhs such as Bhai Piara, Bhai Gurdas and Baba Buddha 
                                across the country in search of original manuscripts. Guru Arjan 
                                made trips to Goindwal, Khadur and Kartarpur to visit the families of 
                                the previous Guru's. Guru Arjan collected original manuscripts of 
                                the Guru's from Mohan (son of Guru Amar Das), Datu (son of Guru Angad) 
                                as well as Sri Chand (son of Guru Nanak). Putting Baba Buddha in charge 
                                of the spiritual needs of the large number of pilgrims visiting Harmandir 
                                Sahib, Guru Arjan now pitched a tent by the side of Ramsar tank and 
                                started the arduous task of compiling the first edition of the Holy 
                                Guru Granth Sahib. Bhai Gurdas was entrusted as the Guru's scribe for 
                                the master copy. Unlike any other religious book in history, Guru Arjan 
                                decided to also include the compositions of Hindu and Muslim saints 
                                which he considered consistent with the teachings of Sikhism and the 
                                Guru's. Guru Arjan included the works of such Hindu Bhaktas as Kabir, 
                                Jaidev, Namdev, Dahnna, Ravidas, Pipa and Ramanand. The Guru also included 
                                the works of such Muslim divines as Farid, Mardana, Satta and Balwand, 
                                the Guru's minstrels, as well as several bards (Bhatts). Bhai Gurdas 
                                was invited by the Guru to include his own verses, but declined out 
                                of modesty.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The monumental 
                                  task was finally completed. This first edition of the Guru Granth Sahib 
                                  known at that time as Pothi Sahib was installed on a high pedestal within 
                                  the Harmandir Sahib in August 1604. Guru Arjan seated himself at 
                                  a lower level and instructed all Sikhs to bow before it, not as an idol, 
                                  but as the book of divine inspiration which instructed living men in 
                                  the ways of God and dedicated secular life. The revered Baba Buddha 
                                  was appointed the first Granthi (custodian) of the book. Guru Arjan 
                                  dictated that unlike the Hindu scriptures, the Pothi Sahib could 
                                  be open to reading by anyone of any caste, creed or sex. This original 
                                  copy is still in existence today.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A rich arrogant 
                                    Hindu banker of Delhi called Chandu Shah tried to marry his daughter 
                                    to Hargobind. But due to his arrogance Guru Arjan refused the match. 
                                    Prithi Chand knew that Chandu Shah welded some influence with the imperial 
                                    court. He used Chandu Shah's anger at being rejected to cause further 
                                    trouble. Prithi Chand had Chandu Shah complain to the Emperor Akbar 
                                    that the Guru had prepared a book which was derogatory in nature to 
                                    Muslim's and Hindu's. Upon hearing this Akbar ordered the Guru to be 
                                    brought before him along with the. Guru Arjan sent the revered Baba 
                                    Buddha and Bhai Gurdas to the Mughal court along with a copy of the 
                                    Holy Granth. Akbar opened the Holy Book and the first hymn read out 
                                    was;</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"My God has breathed 
                                      His Light into the dust. And so brought the world into being. He it 
                                      is who created the sky, the earth, the waters and all vegetation. O 
                                      man, whatever one sees, passes away. But the world usurps anothers due 
                                      and is forgetful of God. It is the world of the animal, nay, of ghosts 
                                      and goblins. It eats the forbidden fruit, usurping what belongs to another. 
                                      Hold thy mind, O man, or God will burn thee in the fire of Hell. Thy

                                      of the pure, knows all that is within thee. Nanak: pray thou to His 
                                      Saints that they lead thee on the Truth Path." (Tilang)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Upon hearing this 
                                        Akbar was satisfied as he had always looked upon the Sikh Gurus as social 
                                        reformers and believed in the unity of God and the brotherhood of man. 
                                        However Chandu Shah accused Bhai Gurdas of not really read the text 
                                        but recited a hymn from memory. Akbar therefor got one Sahib Dyal who 
                                        could read Gurmukhi to appear before the court and opened a page at 
                                        random for him to read, he read the following;</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"You don't see 
                                          God who dwells in your heart. And you carry about an idol around your 
                                          neck. A nonbeliever, you wander about churning water, And you die harassed 
                                          in delusion. The idol you call God will drown with you. The ungrateful 
                                          sinner. The boat will not ferry you across. Says Nanak, I met the Guru 
                                          who led me to God. He who lives in water, earth, nether region, and 
                                          firmament. " (Sulhi)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Emperor now 
                                            exclaimed; "Excepting love and devotion to God, I so far find neither 
                                            praise nor blame to anyone in this Granth. It is a volume worthy of 
                                            reverence." Not only this but Akbar wanted to offer Guru Arjan a suitable 
                                            gift. Guru Arjan asked the Emperor to instead exempt the people of Punjab 
                                            from the annual land revenue that year since their was a severe drought. 
                                            Akbar graciously complied with the Guru's wishes, this greatly increased 
                                            the Guru's popularity with the peasants.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On October 17, 
                                              1605 Akbar died and was succeeded by Jahangir as Emperor. Jahangir was 
                                              a person of lax morals, pleasure loving and fond of drinking. He left 
                                              much of the administration duties of running his kingdom to others. 
                                              Because of his lax morals Jahangir set out to please the orthodox Muslim 
                                              clergy which he knew did not approve of his actions, or the tolerant 
                                              attitude that his father Akbar had previously displayed to other religions. 
                                              Jahangir wrote the following in his memoirs called Tuzak-i-Jehangiri; 
          "At Goindwal on the banks of the river Beas, lived a Hindu, Arjan by 
                                              name, in the garb of a Pir or Sheikh. Thus, many innocent Hindus and 
                                              even foolish and ignorant Muslims he brought into his fold who beat 
                                              the drum noisily of his self-appointed prophethood. He was called Guru. 
                                              From all sides, worshippers came to offer their homage to him and put 
                                              full trust in his word. For three or four generations, they had warmed 
                                              up this shop. For a long time I had harbored the wish that I should 
                                              set aside this shop of falsehood or I should bring him into the fold 
                                              of Islam." Jahangir further writes; "In these days, Khusro (Jahangir's 
                                              rebel son) passed through this way. The foolish person resolved to call 
                                              on him. Khusro halted for a time at this place and this man came to 
                                              see him and discoursed with him on many matters and also applied with 
                                              saffron on his forehead what the Hindus call kashkeh (tilak) and consider 
                                              a good omen. When I heard this account personally, I knew about his 
                                              false pretenses. So I ordered that he be brought into my presence, that 
                                              his property be confiscated and his sons and other possessions be made 
                                              over to Murtaza Khan and he be dealt with in accordance with the political 
                                              and common law of the land."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When Guru Arjan 
                                                received the summons to appear before Jahangir, he knew that it was 
                                                not a good sign. The Guru declared that his son Hargobind should be 
                                                installed as the next Guru. Prominent Sikhs gathered and revered Baba 
                                                Buddha applied the saffron mark on Hargobind's forehead anointing him 
                                                as Guru Hargobind.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Upon reaching Lahore, 
                                                  Jahangir demanded that Guru Arjan revise the Holy Granth, removing 
                                                  all references to Islam and Hinduism. This of course the Guru refused 
                                                  to do. Since Jahangir was on his way to Kashmir, he asked Murtaza Khan 
                                                  to deal with the Guru.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Murtaza Khan immediately 
                                                    jailed the Guru, and ordered the Guru Arjan to be tortured to death 
                                                    if he did not agree to remove the alleged derogatory references in the 
                                                    Holy Granth. The Guru was cruelly tortured. He was made to sit on a 
                                                    red hot iron sheet. They poured burning hot sand on his body. The Guru 
                                                    was dipped in boiling water. The bore all of these brutalities with 
                                                    calm serenity, for five long days he was tortured. When the torturers 
                                                    found the Guru unresponsive to their torture they did not know what 
                                                    to do. On May 30, 1606 the Guru asked for a bath in the river Ravi by 
                                                    the side of the Mughal fort. Thousands of followers watched the Guru 
                                                    who could barely walk make his way to the river with tears in their 
                                                    eyes. His bare body was covered with blisters, Guru Arjan repeated 
                                                    over and over; "Sweet is Your will, O God; the gift of your Name alone 
                                                    I seek." The Guru then calmly walked into the river bank, bidding his 
                                                    farewell to his followers and was gone forever, his body carried away 
                                                    by the currents. This act of brutality in ending such a saintly life 
                                                    with such cruelty was to forever change the course of Sikhism. </font>
