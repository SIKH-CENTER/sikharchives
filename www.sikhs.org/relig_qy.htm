          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When the Imperceptible 
          Lord reveals His ownself to man, then is he blessed with the knowledge, 
          which the Yogis think they obtain through breath control in the central, 
          left and right bronchi. Nanak, the True Lord is above the three devices 
          of breath control.&quot; <i>(Guru Nanak, Siddh Gosh, pg. 944)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Making the still 
            of the circuitious chord, whosoever practises the inly-washing, inhalation, 
            exhalation and suspension of breath; Without the True Guru, he obtains 
            not right understanding and straying in doubt he is drowned.&quot; <i>(Guru 
              Nanak, Parbhati, pg. 1343)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The yoga of the 
            pious person is this, that through the Guru's instruction, he searches 
            his own-self and enshrines within his mind the One Lord, the Enemy of 
            pride. Imbued with the Name, his mind becomes steady. This alone is 
            the sublime avocation. He the detached one enters not into religious 
            controversies and practices not hypocrisy, but by Guru's grace reflects 
            on the Lord's Name. He, who practices chastity and truth and ponders 
            over the Name is the pious Yogi, who practices the real yoga.&quot; <i>(Guru 
              Nanak, Ramkali, pg. 908)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is the quintessence 
            of the Divine discourse, hear thou O Yogi, that without the Name yoga 
            is practiced not. They who are imbued with the Name, remain inebriated 
            night and day. Through the Name attain they the peace. All become renowned 
            through the Name. It is through the Name, that understanding is attained. 
            Without the Name, men wear many religious garbs and them the True Lord 
            has Himself strayed. From the True Guru, the Name is attained, O Yogi 
            and then one comes to know the way of Yoga. Reflect thou in thy mind 
            and see that without the Name, one is emancipated not, O Nanak.&quot; <i>(Guru 
              Nanak, Siddh Gosh, pg. 946)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Be assured that 
            fruitless are his Yogic practices and sacrificial feasts, who forgets 
            the Lord's praise. He who laying aside both his self-conceit and worldly 
            love sings the praise of the Lord, Says Nanak, the mortal of such a 
            type is said to have obtained emancipation whilst alive.&quot; <i>(Guru Tegh 
              Bahadur, Bilawal, pg. 831)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He is the Yogi 
            and he alone finds the way, who has obtained the Name, through the Guru. 
            In that Yogi's body hamlet all the virtues abide. Through religious 
            pretensions one attains not the True Yoga. Nanak, such a Yogi is rare 
            within whose mind the Lord manifests Himself.&quot; <i>(Guru Amar Das, Slok, 
              pg. 556)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>(Guru Nanak, 
            Suhi, pg. 730)</i><br>
            There is but One God, By the True Guru's grace, He is obtained.<br>
            Yoga is not in the patched coat, nor the Yoga is in staff, nor Yoga 
            is in smearing the body with ashes.<br>
            Yoga consists not in earrings, or in shaven head and Yoga is not even 
            in the blowing of the horn. <br>
            Abide pure amidst the worldly impurities. Thus shalt thou find the way 
            of Yoga.<br>
            By mere words Yoga is obtained not. <br>
            He is called a Yogi who looks upon all mortals with the same eye and 
            deems them as equal.<br>
            Yoga consists not in wandering to yonder tombs, or crematoriums, or 
            sitting in trance.<br>
            Yoga consists not in wandering in native and foreign lands, nor in bathing 
            at places of pilgrimage.<br>
            Abide thou pure amid the worldly impurities. Thus shalt thou find the 
            way of Yoga.<br>
            If man meets with the True Guru, then is his doubts dispelled and the 
            wandering mind is restrained.<br>
            It rains Nectar, celestial music plays and from within his mind, man 
            obtains gnosis.<br>
            Remain thou pure amid impurities. Like this shalt thou find the way 
            of Yoga.<br>
            Nanak in the midst of life be thou in death. Practice thou such a Yoga.<br>
            When the horn blows within being blown, then shalt thou obtain the fearless 
            status.<br>
            When man remains detached amidst worldly attachments, then attains he 
            the way of Yoga. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"> </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"> </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font> </p>
