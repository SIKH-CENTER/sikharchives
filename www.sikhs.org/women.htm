          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
          the time of the Gurus women were considered very low in society. Both 
          Hindus and Muslims regarded women as inferior and a man's property. 
          Women were treated as mere property whose only value was as a servant 
          or for entertainment. They were considered seducers and distractions 
          from man's spiritual path. Men were allowed polygamy but widows were 
          not allowed to remarry but encouraged to burn themselves on their husbands 
          funeral pyre (sati). Child marriage and female infanticide were prevalent 
          and purdah (veils) were popular for women. Women were also not allowed 
          to inherit any property. Many Hindu women were captured and sold as 
          slaves in foreign Islamic countries.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In such a climate 
            Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism shocked the entire society by 
            preaching that women were worthy of praise and equal to men. Five hundred 
            years later, the rest of mankind is only now waking up to this fundamental 
            truth. The Gurus actively encouraged the participation of women as equals 
            in worship, in society, and on the battlefield. They encouraged freedom 
            of speech and women were allowed to participate in any and all religious 
            activities including reading of the Guru Granth Sahib. </font> </p>

              condemned the cruel custom of sati, female infanticide and advocated 
              widow remarriage. Guru Amar Das also believed that women wearing veils 
              (purdah) was demeaning. The Guru refused to meet the queen of Haripur 
          or to allow any women into the congregation wearing a veil. </font> </p>

              made the Khalsa initiation ceremony open to men and women alike, a 
              woman being just as worthy. At the time of Amrit a man is given the 
              name Singh meaning lion, the woman is given the name Kaur, meaning 
              Princess. A Sikh women is an individual in her own right, she does 
              not have to take her husband's name and is Kaur till her death. Guru 
              Gobind Singh did not see any distinction between the Khalsa, men or 
              women could keep the 5 K's. Guru Gobind Singh issued orders forbidding 
              the Khalsa having any association with those that practiced female 
              infanticide. Guru Gobind Singh also forbade Sikhs to exercise any 
              proprietary rights over women captured in battle, they could not be 
              kept as slaves or wives but were to be treated with the utmost respect. </font> </p>
