          <h3>The Gursikh</h3>
   
        
 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some readers will 
          be baffled that I use the terms like, Truth, God, Waheguru, Shabad, 
          Gurbani, Guru, Gurus, True Teacher, Saint, Khalsa, Gursikh, True Sikh 
          etc. in the present and past tense, and interchangeably, as if they 
          were synonyms. Guru Nanak's philosophy, like the Vedas, teaches a unity 
          in diversity. In reality, and under ideal conditions, what is the difference 
          between a True Sikh and the Guru, and what is the difference between 
          the Guru and God? The one cannot help it but quietly disappear into 
          the other. I have used these terms freely to indicate this as the goal 
          of a Sikh and its relevance, today as well as in the past, and that 
          we cannot tell where one merged into the other. The differences are 
          only semantic. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, to avoid 
          another delusion, a delusion of self-glorification, we should see all 
          of these as above ourselves. A True Sikh, in his own mind, is always 
          less than what is required. No sooner a seeker believes that he has 
          reached an attainment or understood a principle, he is shown that he 
          was wrong. Because, as God has no limits, so do His principles. Besides, 
          the ego itself is an interruption, and God does not want us to stagnate 
          at any level, no matter how glorious it may seem to us, or to others. 
          A Gursikh regards himself as the lowest of all.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As this word indicates, 
          when the Guru (Teacher) and the Sikh (Disciple) have established a permanent 
          relationship, the Sikh can be called a Gursikh. Before any real progress 
          on the inner journey, a Sikh has to become Gursikh. Why?</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of a Gursikh 
          is to reject all the falsehoods and manifest the ultimate Truth, during 
          his lifetime, and at all costs. In other words, it is, to become a perfect 
          Sikh, like the Guru. This can be called a spiritual cloning. All other 
          rules on this Path are only the means toward this goal. It is possible 
          only through a complete submission to the True Spiritual Teacher. Without 
          it, the walls of ego severely limit all personal efforts to rise above 
          the human nature. Because, all work keeps feeding the ego, which simply 
          mutates into a glorified and a more intangible character. As Swami Vivekananda 
          said, being bound with chains made of pure gold is the same as bound 
          with chains of steel. The bondage of ego, along with its sting, death, 
          is not removed. For this reason, Jesus said that no one could reach 
          his Father except through him. People take it literally. The followers 
          of other messengers have misunderstood them the same way. This has resulted 
          in needless strife, argument, and bloodshed.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Need for a Guru</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ultimate Truth 
          is also unique, not understood by the intellect. It does not match any 
          preconceived human ideas. This is why the Guru is compulsory, but only 
          on the final path, the path to ultimate Truth. When the seeker submits 
          to the Guru with this humility, the Guru quietly plants the way to Truth 
          in his heart. This is called Naam.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scientific and technological 
          advances of today make the man feel, more than ever, in control of his 
          destiny. This makes it harder to be spiritually humble and work on our 
          death. Death insurance, as we may call it, is more important than life 
          insurance. Stop and look around you. It is hard to imagine, but is true, 
          that, the moment our body takes its last breath, none of this intricate 
          knowledge, technology, possessions, or the family and friends, is going 
          to accompany us on the other side. That moment can come at anytime, 
          without a warning. Suddenly, whatever our soul has earned, or lost, 
          will be final. However, our outlook and demeanor show that we are always 
          in a state of denial of this, certain and unpredictable nature of our 
          death. Gautama, the Buddha saw this and many other such human characteristics 
          as completely irrational, like a form of psychosis. This made him the 
          Buddha, different from the rest of humanity.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All rational thought, 
          if followed sincerely and tenaciously, leads us to the gates of Truth 
          but it cannot enter with us. The sign on these gates says: &quot;Here 
          Is The Higher Self, Who Secretly Loves And Controls Everything, And 
          It Is Beyond The Intellect.&quot; According to Guru Nanak, this Higher 
          Self talks only in one language: Boundless, Pure and Unconditional Love. 
          Nevertheless, most individuals with an analytical disposition will find 
          that, time to seek a true teacher is after they have done some serious 
          philosophical analysis. By philosophy, I do not mean Plato or Kant, 
          but the kind that Paul Brunton discusses in 'The Hidden Teaching Beyond 
          Yoga', 'The Wisdom of the Overself', and his earlier books. A True Spiritual 
          Teacher can be useful only when we understand the urgency, and after 
          we have seen the limitation of all personal effort, not before.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A seeker without 
          a Spiritual Guide is like an orphan child in the wilderness. The word, 
          Guru, means - Supreme Spiritual Light. When the seeker has developed 
          a permanent and firm conviction - that his intellect, his education, 
          and all knowledge of the world, without the constant inner guidance 
          of A True Teacher, is actually complete darkness which ultimately leads 
          to death - he is called a <b>Gurmukh</b>. Then, he is able to receive, 
          and share, what the Guru has come to give. Its opposite is called a 
          <b>Manmukh</b>.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An old adage, &quot;When 
          the disciple is ready, the Guru appears,&quot; has withstood the test 
          of time, and is still true. In the eastern circles, such a relationship 
          was always established through some form of initiation. For that, the 
          disciple had to take a vow of a lifelong, complete submission to the 
          teacher. Some form of baptism, sipping or dipping in water, etc. has 
          always accompanied this. An initiation is mandatory.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For reasons known 
          only to God, the disease of false prophets and &quot;green gurus&quot;, 
          as I call them, has plagued the society since the beginning of the human 
          quest. Talking or writing endlessly about deep and lofty spiritual principles 
          does not prove anything. Some writers appear to be excellent teachers. 
          We all learn something from them. However, a True Guru uncovers the 
          truth, which is already within the seeker's heart, and transforms him, 
          without the need of any words. Since he is here to teach only one thing, 
          he can do it mostly silently, through his own example and a spiritual 
          touch, or a gaze. Such a True Spiritual Master is extremely rare and 
          very hard to find.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A seeker's hunger 
          to follow a tangible human guru is a bona fide condition. At some point 
          it is very strong because, it is inherent in the human nature. It is 
          not a sign of some inner weakness. However, it often results in a weak 
          character when the seeker is satisfied with partial spiritual experiences 
          under the care of an imperfect guru. Some people will follow anyone 
          pointing at the sky! Most seekers looking for a spiritual guru are deceived 
          every day.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For this reason, 
          the masses have always instinctively rejected their current Spiritual 
          Messenger, however genuine he might be. They may worship him afterwards, 
          though. On one hand, a half-guru or a fake can waste the life of many 
          sincere spiritual seekers. On the other hand, people turn their faith 
          into a stagnant and decaying faith by following only a Teacher of the 
          past. They will refuse to accept or recognize an Oasis of Truth of their 
          own time if he happens to cross their path, even if He comes and knocks 
          at their door. We can call it, a religious dysfunction. What can we 
          do about it?</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru Nanak, the 
          First Master brought the solution to this problem with the advent of 
          <b>Shabad Guru</b>. The Ten Masters proved that God's Word is The Real 
          Guru, and that with Gurbani (God's word), we can rise above the need 
          to worship a human form of the Guru. They showed it in their own life 
          through two hundred years of practical application. To stress this, 
          The Fifth Master, designated as The Guru then, after compiling the Gurbani 
          into one volume, kept this Holy Book at a higher place, while he would 
          sit and sleep on the floor.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This truth reached 
          its culmination under The Tenth Master. The Tenth Master turned the 
          tide for humanity by prohibiting the Sikhs from, searching for or, following 
          any human Guru. He permanently banished the incurable disease of false 
          prophets from Sikh Panth, through two major changes in the curriculum 
          of spiritual seekers. This was not easy. It has required endless and 
          unmatched sacrifice especially from the Gurus themselves. I will not 
          go into details already recorded in history.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First: Unlike any 
          prior Messengers of God, The Tenth Master did not make a Sikh his, or 
          any other Guru's disciple. He said that a Sikh was God's Property. A 
          Sikh gets Baptism (Amrit), not from a person, but only from water stirred 
          with a double-edged sword while reciting the five daily Sikh prayers. 
          Five Gursikhs, &quot;<b>The Five Beloved</b>,&quot; as The Tenth Master 
          called them at their Initiation, represent the body of the Guru at this 
          ceremony. Being so baptized, the Sikh belongs only to God. The Five 
          Gursikhs, represent the Tenth Master, and initiate the Sikh in the practice 
          of meditation on God's Name with the Gurmantra (the Holy Word, Waheguru). 
          The Amrit and the accompanied Initiation are mandatory.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Tenth Master 
          did something else here that no other Savior has done: After initiating 
          the first Five Gursikhs with the Amrit, he bowed to them and became 
          their spiritual disciple. The Guru himself took the same initiation 
          so that there was no difference between Guru Gobind Singh and the &quot;Five 
          Beloved.&quot; Its significance is not understood easily. In doing so, 
          The Tenth Master blended his own spiritual identity into the Khalsa 
          (see below), so that he will never leave the Khalsa. This shows how 
          he honored God's command to assist Khalsa. In contrast, other Masters 
          in the past left us saying they are going back to God, to make room 
          for us, etc. Who wants to stay with us? History is replete with supreme 
          sacrifices of The Tenth Master. His whole life, including family, was 
          a sacrifice toward worthy causes for humanity. However, this act cannot 
          be duplicated by anyone.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I do not want to 
          tire the reader with details of how the first &quot;Five Beloved&quot; 
          were chosen. I will also skip other instructions given to the Gursikh 
          at the time of Amrit. In short, the aim of a Gursikh is to lose his 
          smaller self in the spiritual service of the Truth, to realize his unity 
          with God or, in other words, to merge with the Khalsa Ideal. Amrit is 
          a start on this path. It is not an automatic qualification or a diploma. 
          It is very important to understand that a Gursikh does not accept initiation 
          of any other kind, from a single human guru.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Gurbani as Guru</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second: God's Word, 
          called Shabad, Shabd, or Gurbani, is the only formal Sikh Guru. True 
          Guru, who is always the True Spiritual Teacher of everyone, is the Shabad, 
          the Word. It is also called the Divine Light. In the Sikh Path, only 
          the Word part of the Guru is worshipped. Since the appearance of Gurbani, 
          we do not need to worship or glorify the person who brought it to us, 
          or declare him as &quot;The Only One&quot; etc. The First Master, Guru 
          Nanak, introduced this concept, when he humbly proclaimed that all teaching, 
          in the form of Gurbani, comes to him from his Master (God) to be given 
          to the world. He merely composed the verse however God commands him. 
          The real abode of Gurbani is God Himself. When they asked Guru Nanak 
          who was his Guru, he said that Shabad (Gurbani) was the Guru.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Sikh may still 
          look for a guru to learn Yoga, archery, philosophy, Mathematics, etc. 
          But, to reach the highest fulfillment of life, he does not go in search 
          of a Guru anymore. This was a giant spiritual step for humanity, although 
          it never made headlines on the news. One day, The Fourth Master quietly 
          wrote the punch lines for the whole world: &quot;Gurbani is in the Guru, 
          and the Guru is in Gurbani. Gurbani holds all the virtues and rewards. 
          When a servant obeys Gurbani's command, the Guru Himself is tangibly 
          present to save him and deliver him.&quot; (SGGS, p.982)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gurbani from Saints 
          of &quot;other&quot; religions, and the Gurus themselves, is preserved 
          in one volume, Guru Granth Sahib. This is the ten Gurus' greatest gift 
          to humanity. Guru Granth Sahib is treated as the Guru's own body. Any 
          addition or modification of Gurbani is not allowed, nor is it necessary. 
          The Ten Masters' soul resides in Gurbani (Jote). Some Gursikhs will 
          become one with this Light. Such a true Sikh is a living example of 
          the Method (Jugat) for seeing it. At least one such Sikh is always here. 
          There is no need to run around searching for him. He knows where you 
          are. He does not run around looking for you either. He lives completely 
          by God's Will. When you need to, God makes sure that you will meet him. 
          Such Gursikhs are served through service of the congregation (Sangat), 
          because Sangat is an extension of the Guru. Sometimes, through God's 
          Mercy, such a Gursikh graces a congregation with his physical presence 
          (Sadh Sangat). The number of such True Sikhs at any given time is directly 
          proportionate to number of seekers who sincerely want to see them.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Witnessing a Gursikh 
          of this stature often makes one weep uncontrollably without any reason, 
          with an intense desire to stay in his presence and become his servant. 
          Gurbani is then seen in its true form, as a living entity. It glows 
          with a romance between man and God and, love for the Sikh. Everything 
          else seems worthless then. Besides Gurbani and Nam Simran, all other 
          activity seems futile. This is the effect of his loving gaze and his 
          enlightened words, soaked with God's Love. It is like coming home, for 
          the first time. This starts to occur whenever the Sikh gets a spiritual 
          glimpse of the same Love in Gurbani, during Kirtan and meditation. Not 
          everyone is affected in this way, though. An occasion to serve such 
          Gursikhs is found once in many lifetimes. This is a glorious milestone 
          in a person's spiritual journey, because, his journey actually starts 
          now. However, these Gursikhs are not to be worshipped as a Guru. In 
          the Sikh Panth, no Gursikh, no matter how great, is to be considered 
          as another Guru. A Gursikh himself would never allow or accept such 
          a label.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To reiterate, though 
          A Gursikh deeply reveres the Ten Masters, above all other Masters, he 
          is forbidden from worshipping any human from the past, the present, 
          or the future. He sees Guru's presence in singing of Gurbani sincerely 
          with other Sikhs (Sangat). Sangat in the presence of Guru Granth Sahib 
          is Sadh Sangat, because Guru Granth Sahib is also Guru's body. It is 
          not for a seeker to assess the spiritual state of others. Therefore, 
          it is only correct to consider all Sat Sangat as Sadh Sangat. Then, 
          Guru, himself, takes care of the details. The Sikh always yearns and 
          prays that he happens to be in the company of some enlightened Gursikhs, 
          because the Guru's teaching tells him to do so. To teach this, The Fifth 
          Master, Guru Arjan wrote: &quot;I bow to every Gursikh I see. I share 
          with them my heart's desire. I pray that they will help me (Spiritually) 
          meet my Beloved Friend Guru&quot; (SGGS, p.763). It is not appropriate 
          for anyone to guess or discuss whatever spiritual exchanges may take 
          place between sincere seekers and True Gursikhs.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Too complicated? 
          Let us examine all the options. Today's seeker has four choices: 1) 
          He can sweep the whole idea of the need of a living Guru under the rug, 
          until he really needs one. 2) He worships and accepts only a Messiah 
          from the past and rejects any current ones who are regularly sent by 
          God to connect us with the Truth; this will assure that he is spiritually 
          stagnant like the masses, until he chooses to wake up and smell the 
          reality. Remember that, stagnation results in decay and disease. 3) 
          He searches for a spiritual guru in a human and takes his chance with 
          whatever he finds. Many fakes and half-spiritual gurus are always waiting, 
          also on the Internet.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or, 4) He follows 
          the Sikh way: Regards Gurbani, God's Word, as the only True Guru. Finds 
          some Sat Sangat, or forms his own Sangat, that is joined only for Naam, 
          not to worship some human. He pays proper homage to all His Messengers, 
          past and present. This is the message of Gurbani. This way, when he 
          is ready, he will meet someone in the Sangat who truly talks and lives 
          Gurbani. His simple presence and spiritual touch will help him on the 
          path to become just like this Gursikh. Such a Gursikh will never attempt 
          to replace the Guru, in Gurbani, with himself or with some other writings.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To many, the idea 
          of submission to something written in a foreign language is not appealing. 
          Besides, it is too simple and too safe for an intellectual to follow. 
          There is a fifth choice: If you cannot accept the truth, or if you cannot 
          trust Gurbani, keep praying to God for the correct way.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Role of Gursikh</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Sikh Path, 
          and in Gurbani, enlightened Gursikhs are given ranks of, Gurmukh - Brahmgyani 
          - Sant - Sadh - Jan - etc. It cannot be said too often. Their company 
          is compulsory for a Sikh's spiritual progress. Only a lit candle can 
          quickly light another one. However, in Sikh Panth, if someone calls 
          himself such a person, or if his followers call him a guru, run away 
          as fast as you can! Display of occult powers, which, come to a Gursikh 
          naturally as he continues to advance, is prohibited in the Guru's House. 
          If someone does so, stay away again, because he is not a mature Sikh. 
          Needless to say that Truth is not for sale and it cannot be bought, 
          if it is, it is not for a Sikh. Again, the only place, to find a True 
          Gursikh is Sadh Sangat.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many Sikhs contend 
          that these ranks do not apply to a living person anymore. This is the 
          cause of doubt, weakness, and lack of direction among the common Sikhs 
          today. This creates a spiritual void. It leaves the door wide open for 
          so-called gurus, the false prophets, to emerge and fill this void, and 
          they lead the sincere seekers away from Gurbani and the Panth. Most 
          Sikhs doubt that anyone can live up to the high standards set by the 
          Ten Masters. If they were correct, the Gurbani is simply metaphorical. 
          Those, who believe Gurbani is mostly metaphors, can get little, if anything, 
          out of it. Sincere Non Sikhs can benefit more from Gurbani in this case. 
          Mediocrity, dishonesty and disorganization prevalent in the Sikh arena 
          can be very discouraging. These are perhaps, the reason for such doubts 
          among the common Sikhs. However, chronicles of regular emergence of 
          True Gursikhs who are firm in practice of Dharma, the Khalsa Panth, 
          meeting such Gursikhs in flesh and witnessing their Glory, eliminate 
          all such doubts.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Shri Naranjan 
          Singh Ji used to say, &quot;Some think that Sikh Panth is disappearing. 
          This is a mistake. Some say that Panth is in a danger. One who is not 
          the Panth is always in a danger. Someone, who gives up Japji, gives 
          up Amrit Vela, is truly in a danger. How can Waheguru's Panth be in 
          any danger? Do not look for large numbers. The Guru did not rely on 
          the count at all. Guru Nanak was looking for only one real Gursikh, 
          Guru Gobind Singh Ji said five would be sufficient. He did not even 
          ask for the sixth.&quot;</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Tenth Master 
          says: &quot;Khalsa is my own body… Khalsa is my face…. Khalsa is my 
          own appearance…This is where I live.&quot; (SLG, p.667) These words, 
          as well as the rest of Gurbani, are not metaphors. Honoring Guru Granth 
          Ji, as Guru's own body, is imperative to its preservation for the future 
          generations. This is one of the reasons that The Tenth Master ordained 
          this. This is not idolatry. A Sikh prays only to the Waheguru and Gurbani 
          in Guru Granth Sahib. We turn to the Holy Book during prayer. This does 
          not mean that we pray to the physical Book. A Sikh does not expect that 
          some day, God or the Guru will step out of the binding or the paper 
          of this Holy Scripture. The Tenth Master has also said, &quot;All those 
          who worship me as God shall burn in the hellfire.&quot; (DG, p.57)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikh Panth is not 
          like the religions of the past. It is just as alive and well now as 
          it has been since Guru Nanak, perhaps, even more so. The only change 
          is that, since the initiation (or, should we say, emergence) of Khalsa, 
          Guru Granth Sahib is the only Sikh Guru in spirit. His Darshan (Glory) 
          in a physical form, thanks to Guru Gobind Singh Ji, has never left us. 
          However, it is not to be found at Hemkunt, nor is it in any human guru. 
          It is experienced in the company of Khalsa. That is not to say that 
          Khalsa is found easily. Such blessed people, as always, do not advertise 
          themselves. A Sikh prays for the blessed sight of Khalsa every day and, 
          then he leaves it up to God to do as He sees fit.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The People</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A primitive, stone-age 
          trait of human behavior is found even today: &quot;If it looks different, 
          kill it before it gets closer.&quot; Many Non Sikhs feel threatened 
          by the uniqueness of the Sikhs. They feel relief in making some simple 
          Sikhs the butt of their jokes. One should not condone lack of hygiene, 
          or bad manners, which can be found among all cultures. Yet, they target 
          only the Sikhs. A car can pass through the eye of a needle before these 
          cultured people can find spirituality or holiness in simple folks!</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This does not mean 
          that all, or only simple people are holy. However, there are certain 
          abstract reasons for God's choosing the very simple and candid people 
          of Punjab, with a rich ancient Indian and spiritual heritage, and with 
          constantly volatile and changing borders, to receive Guru Nanak's message. 
          Could it be that Jesus was born in a manger, to a homeless and poor 
          carpenter's wife, probably for similar reasons? Personally, I would 
          rather roll in dust from the feet of very common people gathered to 
          sing Gurbani, than see the face of someone who wants to replace Gurbani 
          and promises to show me &quot;Sach Khand (God's Abode)&quot; along with 
          all the bells and whistles.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of the Sikhs 
          stand by the fence, rather than follow the Sikh teachings seriously. 
          Still, they get to enjoy beneficial fallout of the Holy activities, 
          of the Ten Masters in the past and some rare and obscure Gursikhs at 
          present. This is clear. For instance, modern Sikh children, with hair, 
          who simply recite Japji as a rule before breakfast, excel in school 
          and whatever else they do, whether it is farming, the military, business, 
          academics, or the sports.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Be realistic if 
          you visit a Sikh place of worship. Expect to find mostly, rather common 
          Sikhs, than some masters of Yoga. Perhaps, the only purpose of the Sikhs 
          from Punjab has been, not to attract or convert others through intricate 
          theology, or elegance, but to simply preserve and perpetuate the flame 
          of Khalsa for the rest of the world. It seems that their work is now 
          done. Proliferation of false gurus today, especially with the advancement 
          of technology, makes it important that all the true spiritual seekers 
          in the world know the meaning of the True Guru, and what Gurbani and 
          the Panth represent. Spiritual sincerity toward God is the central message 
          of Gurbani. If you have it, you are on the right track. You do not have 
          to leave your religion to be able to follow Gurbani. However, if your 
          religion does not support it, it is time to move on and be an example 
          to others.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than once, 
          during, and after the time of The Tenth Master, the Sikhs have been 
          virtually annihilated. They always survive these assaults. History is 
          filled with countless accounts of the Sikhs' martyrdom. For this reason, 
          The Tenth Master ordained that all the Sikhs should also be warriors. 
          Being constantly oppressed and mistreated as a minority has made most 
          Sikhs of today anxious to have a Sikh domain, separate from India. However, 
          God's Khalsa has no country. The whole world is his country. Granted 
          that every man with blood in his arteries is patriotic in his heart, 
          but a Khalsa cannot be nationalistic in practice. A Khalsa does not 
          aspire to rule over others or acquire a piece of land. His goal is to 
          see that ultimately, only God's dearest will govern a universal brotherhood 
          on this earth, with all the religions and all countries in a harmony 
          with each other.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 5K's</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides a Sikh's 
          spiritual practices, the Sikh conduct, and the five daily prayers, there 
          are five essentials of a Gursikh's uniform. Otherwise, he is not considered 
          a Gursikh or a member of God-Guru's army. They are five attributes of 
          Guru Gobind Singh Ji, The Tenth Master. They are also known as the &quot;Five 
          K's.&quot; The Tenth Master designated these as a mandatory first step 
          on a Sikh's way to become like The Tenth Master himself. To a Gursikh, 
          each one of them is a loving reminder of The Tenth Master. The Tenth 
          Master ordained the Gursikhs to consider these inseparable from their 
          body. This uniform also makes the Sikh stand out in a crowd, so that 
          a Sikh cannot hide himself. Here are some other reasons:</font> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. <b>Kesh:</b> 
            The Tenth Master did not mutilate his hair. Only humans have long 
            hair, animals do not. If we cut a hand off, it is not equipped to 
            recover, but the hair does, even if you continue cutting it for years. 
            Preserving natural hair is also a denial of preoccupation with one's 
            appearance. Throughout the history, for some reason, all Holy men 
            have stopped cutting hair at some point of their spiritual development.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Sikh's head 
            is kept covered. Women wear a scarf, while men wear a turban. This 
            is an ancient, perhaps necessary, and forgotten, a gesture of respect 
            toward God, who is always here, with us. The turban is wrapped fresh 
            every day after the bath. In many countries it is considered a disgrace 
            to be seen bareheaded. This is in contrast with the western tradition 
            of going bareheaded in a formal place. This makes each appear odd 
            in the eyes of the other, especially to those who have not traveled 
            outside their own small circles. A cap or a hat is prohibited for 
            a Gursikh.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">B. <b>Kachhahra:</b> 
            The Tenth Master always wore a pair of knee length shorts, a holy 
            undergarment, even (especially) during Ishnan. It also preserves a 
            Sikh man or a woman's dignity in times of emergency, and during their 
            devotional states of oblivion.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C. <b>Kirpan:</b> 
            The Tenth Master always carried a sword. He worshipped it as an emblem 
            of God's Mercy, Siri Sahib, as Guru Gobind Singh Ji called it. Kirpan 
            is a Sikh's ornament, in the memory of The Tenth Master. It is his 
            fashion statement, like a necktie. He wears and displays it with pride, 
            except where people cannot tolerate it due to lack of understanding.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The struggle for 
            survival of the pious will continue for many centuries ahead. The 
            advent of Khalsa marks a reemergence of the ancient ideal man, the 
            saintly-warrior. He is desperately needed today, as The Tenth Master 
            said, &quot;Khalsa is God's own army. Khalsa has appeared because 
            of God's wish.&quot; His sword is a token of fearlessness and his 
            readiness to die while defending the truth and the persecuted. With 
            advanced weaponry, it has been a mere symbol, but its spiritual meaning 
            is as important today as it was in the past. A Khalsa respects the 
            sword as The Tenth Master did. A True Sikh follows The Tenth Master's 
            example and uses a weapon only as a last resort, with extreme humility 
            and compassion. There will always be those, the Sikh or the Non Sikh, 
            who will misuse any weapon.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">D. <b>Karra:</b> 
            The Tenth Master said that Sikhs should always wear a steel bracelet. 
            He wore it too. It is a symbol, as a link in the chain of brotherhood 
            of Gursikhs, and a sign of his commitment as a servant of God.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">E. <b>Kangha:</b> 
            The Tenth Master carried a small comb. He said the Sikhs should do 
            the same, to make its use mandatory. It is to remind us not to regress 
            toward rituals of empty show. Some Indian monks grow artificially 
            cultured hair, several yards long, unbroken and uncombed, as a display 
            of holiness.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is not so obvious 
            that hair is also a living appendage of the body. You may want to 
            read Dr. Birendra Kaur's article on this. For spiritually sensitive 
            people, sharing a comb is essentially the same as sharing a toothbrush.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People ask why we 
          need any outer rules to find God's simple Truth inside ourselves. It 
          is the complexity of society that makes some form of rules extremely 
          necessary. If you live in a jungle, no rules are necessary. If you come 
          to a city, you need to obey at least the rules of traffic. If you join 
          the army or take some other responsible job, you have to follow even 
          more extensive and strict rules. Strangely, we expect to achieve the 
          highest fulfillment of our life without having to obey any rules. Besides, 
          how many rules are there? People are horrified mostly of the prospect 
          that they will have to stop mutilating the hair, they will not be able 
          to keep up with the social fads, and thus face rejection by their peers. 
          People can benefit from the Guru's teachings without growing uncut hair, 
          until they have the strength to accept and understand all the rules. 
          Some sacrifice is inevitable. As a whole, it is a very small price to 
          pay for being able to spiritually participate in helping the world avoid 
          being influenced by the green gurus.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These rules will 
          never make any sense to some people. Spiritual rules are senseless, 
          and needless, if you do not or, cannot have faith in them. Then, they 
          definitely turn into empty rituals that no intelligent person should 
          ever practice. Doing so degrades the image of other, more serious seekers 
          also. For the same reason, people should not force their children and 
          other family members to conform. Rather, be a good example for them 
          to follow, and give them some freedom. Spirituality is a very personal 
          matter. Only ignorant people will blame you for the actions of your 
          family. Opinions of ignorant people are not important. Look at the Gurus' 
          history, their own sons did not obey them.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Submission</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a serious seeker, 
          following the Guru's command, regardless of its reason, is an exercise 
          in self-abnegation. Others cannot comprehend this behavior. Any rules, 
          prescribed by any Master, are of no value to these people. History shows 
          that a Guru will frequently ask his disciple to do things that make 
          no apparent sense. The Guru does this, sometimes, just to strengthen 
          a Sikh's submission to the Guru. It is acceptable to question everything 
          a Guru does, until the seeker turns into a spiritual disciple. You can 
          take a lifetime to satisfy your intellectual doubts first. In the end, 
          you will find that each of the Guru's commands has some hidden reasons. 
          A Sikh (spiritual disciple) accepts his Guru's command without question. 
          This is a required condition. Otherwise, he is not a spiritual disciple; 
          he can be called a student, an observer, or, a bystander. Not everyone 
          will follow the simple rules prescribed by the Tenth Master. Many will 
          prefer some other teachers.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The way to God is 
          not difficult, but it is totally different from what we can imagine. 
          It requires breaking the ages old, firmly established habits of the 
          intellect and mastering new disciplines. We can spend our whole life 
          trying to accomplish this on our own or, we can submit to a True Guru 
          with no more questions. This allows a Master to destroy the disciple's 
          ego and transform him quickly and easily, from the inside. When the 
          disciple is ripe, the Guru can accomplish many lifetimes' work with 
          one look. Shri Naranjan Singh Ji used to say, &quot;An ant may try to 
          get to the top of a tree on its own. Or, someone may have mercy, pick 
          it up and put it there.&quot; Again, in the Sikh Panth this is accomplished 
          by 1) The Gurbani and Sangat, 2) The Tenth Master, when a Gursikh follows 
          his lifestyle and 3) The Khalsa Gursikh, through his physical presence 
          and his spiritual touch. All three are essential. In fact, in the essence, 
          there is no separation among the three.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some say that they 
          will &quot;follow&quot; only the first nine Gurus. This is a fallacy. 
          There is no difference in the Ten Gurus. The Tenth Master completed 
          what the First Master started. Some argue that we need to change with 
          time and thus eliminate or modify the five K's etc. Who is qualified 
          to change Guru Gobind Singh's mandate? &quot;But,&quot; they say, &quot;Is 
          it not the inside rather than appearance, that is important to God?&quot; 
          A curt answer is, yes it is, to God, but not to you. Try not washing 
          yourself from now on, or stay out in sub zero temperature without your 
          gloves, walk naked on Broadway, then try to meditate in the jail, or, 
          just chop your fingers off, they are not important to God! I hope you 
          have grasped the idea.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Everything we do 
          to our body is very important. It leaves an imprint on the inner mind, 
          unless we were totally free from the psycho spiritual bondage to our 
          body. The five K's serve as a conduit of blessings from The Tenth Master 
          to common Sikh masses that may be otherwise weak. The Five K's, the 
          five daily pieces of Gurbani, and correct Sikh conduct (Rehet) is a 
          track, that leads to becoming like The Tenth Master, because these are 
          his own characteristics. In the least, they act like a thorny fence 
          around delicate spiritual flowers in the garden of Sikh Panth. Again, 
          all these rules are means to an end, which is spiritual self-realization. 
          When a Sikh considers any one his activities as an attainment by itself, 
          his progress stops.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru Nanak, the 
          First Master, brought a social order of the ancient Spiritual Masters, 
          hidden in the Himalayas, to common people of the world. Common Sikhs 
          have not risen to its call. This social order has no obligation to conform 
          to the society, or to the ever-changing fads of society. Nor does it 
          have a need to convert the whole world into its own mold. Its welfare 
          does not depend on us; our welfare depends on it. Guru Gobind Singh 
          Ji, the Tenth Master, was the perfect living example of this order of 
          Saints. He gave it a final shape with a few very essential rules. He 
          did this to assure that it will not disintegrate, dissolve, or get contaminated 
          and assimilated by other cultures or cults. And to nurture a favorable 
          environment that will facilitate regular emergence of the ancient Saintly 
          characters, in common households, in the entire world. This was not 
          possible in the world before.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ninth Master 
          describes some qualities of such a Saintly character, whose only joy 
          is in the spirit: &quot;One, who is not afraid of suffering, does not 
          desire pleasure, and is not attached to love of others. He has no fear, 
          and regards gold and clay as equal in value. It is same if someone worships 
          him or slanders him, nor does he have greed, false attachment with family, 
          or pride. He stays above elation or gloom. Honor or dishonor does not 
          faze him. He gives up vain planning (and would rather stay rooted in 
          Naam), and has no hunger for any fruit from his deeds. He sees a futility 
          in the things of the world. When he is also free of lust, as well as 
          anger, God manifests in him. A man understands this method (Jugat) only 
          from Guru's mercy. Such a soul merges into God, just like, one day, 
          the ice melts and becomes indistinguishable from water.&quot; (SGGS, 
          p.633-34) The Ninth Master was a glorious living example of this Shabad. 
          In return, a Mogul emperor, beheaded him in cold blood, at the city-square, 
          and then, would not allow anyone to come forward and take proper care 
          of his severed head and his body.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Sikh is taught 
          to have an inner spirituality, rather than make a show of it. His aim 
          is to see God during this lifetime. Gurbani is filled with this teaching. 
          For example, The Tenth Master describes the Sikh version of Sannyasa 
          (Renunciation). Sannyasa is the final of the four stages of a householder 
          among the ancient Hindus, where, during the last quarter of his life, 
          the seeker leaves the world to meditate on God. However, like most other 
          religious practices of that time, it had degenerated into a ritualistic 
          show, of holiness. A Sikh is taught to practice inner Sannyasa from 
          the beginning, at a young age, while continuing as a householder, rather 
          than leaving the world. The Tenth Master tells us how a true Sikh would 
          substitute each of the rituals of Sannyasa:</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Make it a 
          mental Sannyasa: Regard all the comforts in the house as wilderness, 
          remain free of desires. Be lonely in your heart (while staying with 
          your family, instead of leaving them). Replace your artificially cultured 
          long hair with chastity. Replace your obsessive cleansing rituals with 
          true Yoga. Let a fixed daily spiritual routine replace your preserved 
          long nails. Let the spiritual knowledge be your minister to pronounce 
          you a sannyasi. Teaching lessons to your self should replace the wandering 
          to preach others. Let meditation on God's Name replace the ashes you 
          put on your body. Minimal food, minimal sleep, mercy, forgiveness, a 
          body intoxicated with God's love, tolerance, and contentment, thriving 
          on these will make you stay above the three worldly qualities. Remember 
          that, you can see your innermost Self and be with God, only when you 
          keep your mind free of lust, anger, pride, greed, compulsion, and false 
          attachment with the family.&quot; (DG, p.709)</font>
