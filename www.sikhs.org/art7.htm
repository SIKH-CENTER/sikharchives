Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh!</font>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          When somebody asks me who I am, I say that I am a Sikh. I do not say 
          that I am a man, or an Indian, or Punjabi. I no longer identify with 
          any of these as a way to describe me. I am a Sikh first, and then I 
          am an Indian. That is how I feel today.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many years ago, 
          when I was much younger, I would not identify myself as a Sikh. When 
          asked who I was, I would say that I was an Indian. I spent the majority 
          of my childhood in Africa, as my parents were working on a contractual 
          basis as teachers. Growing up as a Sikh in a foreign climate is not 
          an easy thing to do -- especially if you are the only one. As a child, 
          I did not understand the reactions of the other school children to my 
          apparent &quot;differentness&quot;. This led to confusion and often frustration. 
          I was often the object of jokes and ridicule that I could not fathom. 
          And worse, I had no ground for a defense, because I did not know what 
          that defense should constitute. I did not know why I kept long hair 
          and wore a bracelet. As a child exposed to these factors it was very 
          easy to wonder why I even needed these outward symbols that I wore. 
          It was easy to want to discard them for a desire to be accepted into 
          the prevailing culture; to become one of the norm.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My father strictly 
          forbade anything of the sort.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And so the years 
          passed.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Eventually, slowly, 
          after a lot of introspection and thinking, and questioning, I began 
          to understand. During my first year in College I was fortunate enough 
          to meet a fellow Sikh student. He had been in America for five years 
          while I had only arrived. He was very curious and questioned me in almost 
          everything I did. At the time I was surprised as to his reactions and 
          wondered what his motives were. However, it turned out that he only 
          had the best of intentions for me, and did me a great service by provoking 
          me into thinking about why I was who I was, and questioning my beliefs. 
          It was during the short time that I had the good fortune of knowing 
          him that I realized something very important about Sikhism. I realized 
          that this is not a part of history that we are just keeping alive. Sikhism 
          is a very relevant religion that is as important today as it was almost 
          five hundred years ago. And my Sikh friend helped me realize a pride 
          in being a Sikh that I had never experienced before.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Truly, there is 
          nothing in this world worth concerning oneself over, nothing worth fighting 
          over, save your religion. When there is nothing else left for a man, 
          when the world has given up hope on him, when his friends have deserted 
          him, and when even his family has left him for dead, there is only the 
          one holy Name of God that will come to his aid. And wherever he may 
          go, there he can count on the only one Name of God. Why then, should 
          he not remember the Creator and thank Him for all that is given? There 
          is a curious thing about life. And that is that in one instant, it can 
          show you just how vulnerable you are. We build our empires, and our 
          fortunes, and sometimes we get carried away, thinking that we are powerful, 
          or strong. But it only takes a fraction of a second for all that to 
          come crashing down.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There is a story 
          about this. When Shah Jahan heard GuruJi's Bani, he could not accept 
          that God could turn a beggar into the king of the whole world and then 
          into a beggar again in a thrice. And the time came, when Aurangzeb sent 
          the message to Shah Jahan, that he was very ill. Shah Jahan was Aurangzeb's 
          father. And the orders were that when Shah Jahan arrived to see his 
          son, he should be captured and thrown into prison. This Aurangzeb did 
          out of greed for wealth of the empire. And it was only when Shah Jahan 
          was captured, and imprisoned, that he remembered GuruJi's Bani, and 
          realized that it was true.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I gradually began 
          to understand more and more about Sikhism. I realized the importance 
          of wearing my hair long, and of wearing a turban. I remember to this 
          day my fathers strictness on our religion. And it was at this time that 
          I realized why. Today I am glad that my father forbade me from discarding 
          the symbols. They define me. They define who I am. I must wear my turban 
          because I am a Sikh. Without it I would not be a Sikh. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And as this realization 
          dawned, I began to be more curious. I began to study, and learnt about 
          the glorious history of the Sikhs. One of the questions that I had had 
          as a child was why it seemed that everyone wanted to persecute us. Why 
          did it seem that everyone wanted to harm us. Why was there a need for 
          me to be on guard nearly all the time. And the answer to that question 
          was given to me, years later. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is because 
          you are Sikh that people want to hurt you.&quot;</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But Sikhs thrive 
          on adversity and are at their best under pressure. A religion that was 
          born in such tumultuous times could only survive by being strong and 
          powerful. And then came the realization that I was a Sikh. I was the 
          one who would protect the weak and serve the poor. I was the one who 
          would fight for the oppressed. And I had been given the power to do 
          so.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When this realization 
          dawned in me, I lost all fear that I had had. There is One to pray to. 
          He will protect you, and none other.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Today, my only 
          real support is my religion. It gives me hope, strength, and courage. 
          Without it, I am a mere shell, a body without any light. It would be 
          preferable to die rather than to live without Sikhism.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Gobind Singh 
          Ji was the greatest warrior, and he created an army of such brilliance 
          and discipline that none in the past or future will equal it. The Sikhs 
          in Guru Gobind Singh Ji's time were courageous and brave. Moreover, 
          they were united as one power, one force. They were the magnificent 
          warriors that went forth to lay down their lives to save another's religion. 
          They were the one's who sacrificed themselves so that others may live. 
          They are the true saints. Learning about them and their heroic deeds 
          always infuses me with hope and courage.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Prayer is a great 
          part of any religion. In Sikhism, the prayer itself will give the person 
          spirituality, and instill a deep understanding and peace unto the person 
          who even utters the sacred words. By joining the society of true saints 
          a person can gain the passageway to God.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There are many 
          aspects of Sikhism that I am only beginning to discover. I still have 
          a lot to learn, and am by no means an expert on anything. Nor am I to 
          be counted as a holy man. I am a sinner. However, I did write this article 
          because something special happened to me. I would have gone one to become 
          a lifeless, Godless person. However, through the grace of God, I instead 
          became a person with a respect for life and for God. There are many 
          youth in the Western nations of today who are being swept away by the 
          societal and cultural pressures of the white society. Traditional ways 
          are forgotten. They may feel lost, or may be lost. And they may lose 
          their religion. If they are Sikhs, then they cannot afford to do so, 
          for they would be denying their heritage as Princes and Kings and wandering 
          the lands like beggars.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To be a Sikh is 
          to be the most Godlike as man can get. To be a Sikh is to be at the 
          highest level of achievement an individual can have in his or her lifetime. 
          All pains vanish, and comes only bliss. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My search and learning 
          will continue. However, I can now be assured that I am on the right 
          path, and that God is guiding me.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> May God bless you 
          in all that you do, and all the best wishes for your future.</font> </p>
