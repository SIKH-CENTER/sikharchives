        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pyare Sadh Sangat 
          Ji, Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru ji ki Fateh!! </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I would like to 
          share the following: I have previously misinterpreted Guru Nanak 
          Ji's way of dealing with the existing religions of the world as sympathetic. 
          I saw in our great Guru Ji nothing more than a reformer, who carried 
          a message of peace for everybody. I have began to realize, however, 
          that Guru Nanak Ji, was the greatest teacher of the world who brought 
          forward true knowledge and made no compromises in his principles. During 
          my limited study and understanding of the shabads of Guru Nanak 
          Ji, I felt that the Guru Ji found existing religions to be seething 
          masses of moral putrefaction. He detected among their elements rituals 
          and superstition, and he struck at the root of these problems by demanding 
          truth in faith and spirit in worship. Guru Ji cleared away everything 
          that inhibited the relationship between God and human. Guru Ji held 
          out no promises in this world or even in the next world. Guru Ji taught 
          that the idea of life, the measure of salvation, is not happiness or 
          peace of mind. To serve God and be able to love Him is in itself better 
          than happiness, though it may be with wounded feet, bleeding brows, 
          and laden with sorrow. </font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Nanak 
          Ji separated Vedantic philosophy from religion, and declared it to be 
          a mere gymnastics of the mind. Guru Ji showed me that religion is less 
          a matter of intellect and more a matter of spirit. The practice of Yoga 
          may do very well for emptying the mind of desires, but it only gives 
          a negative result. I feel I remain as much removed from the love of 
          God in this stupid nothingness as when I am troubled by various desires. 
          Guru Nanak Ji substituted music, the singing of God's praises (SHABAD 
          KIRTAN), for Yoga as a means of linking the soul of humans with God. </font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Nanak 
          Ji also helped greatly improve existing spiritual rules of conduct. 
          There are two sorts of duties: (1) what we ought to do and (2) what 
          we ought NOT to do. World religions had very early recognized the latter. 
          &quot;Thou shall NOT kill and Thou shall NOT do this or that.....this 
          was all that was understood by the word Dharma or duty. But by concentrating 
          all my attention on one side of the matter, I forgot that the other 
          side existed at all. This emphasis on the negative side of virtue led 
          to the adoption of asceticism in the east as the highest ideal of life, 
          which ultimately means the negation of all manly duty. Guru Nanak 
          Ji preached a higher truth. To him LOVE was ACTIVE SERVICE, and his 
          disciples soon profited from this teaching. I have not seen a higher 
          record of service in history than that shown by the Sikhs, who were 
          taught to annihilate the thought of self and utilize all their energy 
          in the SERVICE of GOD and HUMANITY. To me, no one LOVED God and humanity 
          more than Guru Nanak Ji. By the Guru's grace, may we all be blessed 
          to carry Guru Nanak Ji's mission into the future. </font> </p>
