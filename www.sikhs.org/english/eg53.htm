      <p> One who, as Gurmukh, enjoys her Husband Lord, O perishable bride,
        knows Him to be all-pervading everywhere. The Husband Lord is
        all-pervading everywhere; behold Him ever-present. Throughout
        the ages, know Him as the One. The young, innocent bride intuitively
        enjoys her Husband Lord; she meets the Architect of karma. One
        who tastes the sublime essence of the Lord, and chants the sublime
        Word of the Shabad, remains immersed in the Lord's Sacred
        Pool. O Nanak, that soul-bride is pleasing to her Husband Lord,
        who, through the Shabad, remains in His Presence.  || 2 ||   Go
        and ask the happy soul-brides, O perishable bride, who have eradicated
        self-conceit from within. Those who have not eradicated self-conceit,
        O perishable bride, do not realize the Hukam of their Husband
        Lord's Command. Those who eradicate self-conceit obtain their
        Husband Lord and delight in His Love. Forever attuned to His Love,
        in perfect poise and grace, she repeats His Name night and day.
        Very fortunate is that bride who focuses her consciousness on
        Him; her Lord's Love is so sweet to her. O Nanak, that soul-bride
        who is adorned with Truth is imbued with her Lord's Love,
        in peace and poise.  || 3 ||   Overcome your egotism, O perishable
        bride, and walk in the Guru's Way. Thus you shall enjoy your
        Husband Lord forever, O perishable bride, and obtain an abode
        in the home of your own inner being. Obtaining an abode in the
        home of her inner being, she vibrates the Word of the Shabad,
        and is a happy soul-bride forever. The Husband Lord is delightful
        and forever young; night and day, He embellishes His bride. Her
        Husband Lord activates the destiny written on her forehead, and
        she is adorned with the True Shabad. O Nanak, the soul-bride is
        imbued with the Love of the Lord, when she walks according to
        the Will of the True Guru.  || 4 || 1 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:
        All the dealings of the Gurmukhs are good, if they are accomplished
        with poise and grace. Night and day, they chant the Naam, and
        earn their profits, drinking in the subtle essence of the Lord.
        They earn the profit of the subtle essence of the Lord, dwelling
        on the Lord, and chanting the Naam, night and day. They gather
        in merits, and eliminate demerits, and become self-realized. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, they are blessed with glorious greatness;
        they drink in the essence of the True Word of the Shabad. O Nanak,
        devotional worship of the Lord is a unique experience, but only
        a few Gurmukhs perform it.  || 1 ||   As Gurmukh, plant the crop
        of the Lord deep within, and let it grow in your body-field. Within
        the home of your own being, enjoy the Lord's subtle essence,
        and earn profits in the world beyond. This profit is earned in
        the world beyond by enshrining the Lord within the mind; blessed
        is this farming and trade. Meditating on the Lord's Name,
        and enshrining Him within the mind, the Guru's Teachings
        are understood. The self-willed manmukhs have grown weary of this
        farming and trade; their hunger and thirst will not go away. O
        Nanak, plant the seed of the Name within the mind, and adorn yourself
        with the True Word of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   Those humble beings
        engage in the Lord's trade, who have the jewel of such pre-ordained
        destiny upon their foreheads. Under Guru's Instruction, the
        mind abides in the home of the self; through the True Word of
        the Shabad, she becomes unattached. By the destiny written upon
        their foreheads, they become truly unattached, and by reflective
        meditation, they are imbued with Truth. Without the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, the whole world is insane; through the Shabad,
        the ego is conquered. Attached to the True Word of the Shabad,
        wisdom wells up. </p>

      </p>
      <p> The Gurmukh obtains the Naam, the Name of the Husband Lord. O
        Nanak, through the Shabad, one meets the Lord, the Destroyer of
        fear; by the destiny written on her forehead, she ravishes and
        enjoys Him.  || 3 ||   All farming and trading is by Hukam of
        His Command; surrendering to His Command, glorious greatness is
        obtained. Under Guru's Instruction, one comes to understand
        His Command; by His Command, one is united in His Union. By His
        Command, one intuitively merges and blends with Him. The Word
        of the Guru's Shabad is incomparable. Through the Guru, true
        greatness is obtained, and one is embellished with Truth. One
        finds the Destroyer of fear, and eradicates self-conceit; as Gurmukh,
        one is united in His Union. Says Nanak, the Name of the immaculate,
        inaccessible, unfathomable Commander is permeating and pervading
        everywhere.  || 4 || 2 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  O my mind,
        contemplate the True Lord forever. Dwell in peace in the home
        of your own being, and the Messenger of Death will not be able
        to touch you. The noose of the Messenger of Death will not be
        able to touch you, when you embrace love for the True Word of
        the Shabad. Forever imbued with the True Lord, the mind becomes
        immaculate, and its comings and goings are ended. The love of
        duality and doubt have ruined the self-willed manmukh, who is
        lured away by the Messenger of Death. Says Nanak, listen, O my
        mind: contemplate the True Lord forever.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        the treasure is deep within you; do not search for it on the outside.
        Eat only that which is pleasing to the Lord; as Gurmukh, receive
        the blessing of His Glance of Grace. As Gurmukh, receive the blessing
        of His Glance of Grace, O my mind; the Name of the Lord, your
        help and support, is deep within you. The self-willed manmukhs
        are blind and devoid of wisdom; they are ruined by the love of
        duality. Without the Name, no one is emancipated. All are bound
        by the Messenger of Death. O Nanak, the treasure is deep within
        you; do not search for it on the outside.  || 2 ||   O my mind,
        obtaining the blessing of this human birth, some are engaged in
        the trade of Truth. They serve their True Guru, and the Infinite
        Word of the Shabad resounds deep within. Deep within is the Infinite
        Shabad, and the Beloved Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the
        Naam, the nine treasures are obtained. The self-willed manmukhs
        are engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya; they suffer in
        pain, and through duality, they lose their honor. But those who
        conquer their ego, and merge in the True Shabad, are totally imbued
        with Truth. O Nanak, it is so difficult to obtain this human life;
        the True Guru imparts this understanding.  || 3 ||   O my mind,
        those who serve their True Guru are the most fortunate beings.
        Those who conquer their minds are beings of renunciation and detachment.
        They are beings of renunciation and detachment  -  they are
        lovingly focused on the True One; they realize and understand
        themselves. Their intellect is steady, deep and profound; as Gurmukh,
        they naturally chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Some are
        lovers of beautiful young women; infatuation with Maya is very
        dear to them. The unfortunate self-willed manmukhs remain asleep.
        O Nanak, those who intuitively serve their Guru have perfect destiny.
        || 4 || 3 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  Purchase the jewel, the
        priceless treasure; the True Guru has given this understanding.
        The profit of profits is devotional worship of the Lord; one's
        virtues merge into the virtues of the Lord. </p>

      </p>
      <p> One's virtues merge into the virtues of the Lord as one comes
        to understand one's own self, earning the profit of devotional
        worship in this world. Without devotion, there is no peace; through
        duality, one's honor is lost, but under Guru's Instruction,
        one is blessed with the Support of the Naam. The profit of the
        merchandise of the Naam is earned forever, by those whom the Lord
        employs in this trade. They purchase the jewel, the invaluable
        treasure, when the True Guru gives this understanding.  || 1 ||
        Emotional attachment to Maya is totally painful; this is a bad
        bargain. Speaking falsehood, one eats poison; evil is greatly
        increasing. Evil is greatly increasing in this world of skepticism;
        without the Name, one's honor is lost. Reading and studying,
        the religious scholars argue and debate; but without understanding,
        there is no peace. Their comings and goings never end; emotional
        attachment to Maya is dear to them. Emotional attachment to Maya
        is totally painful; this is a bad bargain.  || 2 ||   The counterfeit
        and the genuine are all appraised in the Court of the True Lord.
        The counterfeit are cast out of the Court, and they stand there,
        crying in misery. They stand there, crying in misery  -  the
        foolish, idiotic, self-willed manmukhs have wasted their lives.
        Maya is the poison which has deluded the world; it does not love
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The self-willed manmukhs hate
        the Saints; they harvest only pain in this world. The counterfeit
        and the genuine are appraised in that True Court of the Lord.
        || 3 ||   He Himself acts; who else should I ask? No one else
        can do anything. As He pleases, He engages us; such is His glorious
        greatness. Such is His glorious greatness  -  He Himself causes
        all to act; no one is a warrior or a coward. The Life of the world,
        the Great Giver, the Architect of karma  -  He Himself grants
        forgiveness. By Guru's Grace, self-conceit is eradicated,
        O Nanak, and through the Naam, honor is obtained. He Himself acts;
        who else should I ask? No one else can do anything.  || 4 || 4
        ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  The True merchandise is the Name
        of the Lord. This is the true trade. Under Guru's Instruction,
        we trade in the Lord's Name; its value is so very great.
        The value of this true trade is so very great; those who are engaged
        in the true trade are very fortunate. Inwardly and outwardly,
        they are imbued with devotion; they enshrine love for the True
        Name. Those who are blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace
        obtain Truth, and contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Name find peace, dealing
        in Truth.  || 1 ||   Egotistical involvement in Maya is filth;
        Maya is overflowing with filth. Under Guru's Instruction,
        the mind is made pure, and the tongue drinks in the subtle essence
        of the Lord. The tongue drinks in the subtle essence of the Lord,
        and deep within, the heart is drenched with His Love, contemplating
        the True Word of the Shabad. Deep within, the well of the heart
        is overflowing with the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar; the water-carrier
        draws and drinks in the water of the Shabad. One who is blessed
        with the Lord's Glance of Grace is attuned to the Truth;
        with his tongue, he chants the Lord's Name. O Nanak, those
        who are attuned to the Naam are immaculate. The others are full
        of the filth of egotism.  || 2 || </p>

      <p> All the religious scholars and astrologers read and study, and
        argue and shout. Who are they trying to teach? Deep within, they
        are stained with the filth of emotional attachment to Maya; they
        deal in Maya alone. They love to deal in Maya in this world; coming
        and going, they suffer in pain. The worm of poison is addicted
        to poison; it is immersed in manure. He does what is pre-ordained
        for him; no one can erase his destiny. O Nanak, attuned to the
        Naam, lasting peace is found; the ignorant fools die screaming.
        || 3 ||   Their minds are colored by emotional attachment to
        Maya; because of this emotional attachment, they do not understand.
        The mind of the Gurmukh is imbued with the Lord's Love, and
        the love of duality departs. The love of duality departs, and
        one merges in Truth; the treasure of Truth is overflowing. One
        who becomes Gurmukh, comes to understand; the Lord embellishes
        him with Truth. He alone merges with the Lord, whom the Lord causes
        to merge; nothing else can be said or done. O Nanak, without the
        Name, some are deluded by doubt; but others, imbued with the Name,
        enshrine love for the Lord.  || 4 || 5 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:
        O my mind, the world comes and goes in birth and death; only
        the True Name shall emancipate you in the end. When the True Lord
        Himself grants forgiveness, then one does not have to enter the
        cycle of reincarnation again. He does not have to enter the cycle
        of reincarnation again, and he is emancipated in the end; as Gurmukh,
        he obtains glorious greatness. Imbued with love for the True Lord,
        he is intoxicated with celestial bliss, and he remains absorbed
        in the Celestial Lord. The True Lord is pleasing to his mind;
        he enshrines the True Lord in his mind. Attuned to the Word of
        the Shabad, he is emancipated in the end. O Nanak, those who are
        attuned to the Naam, merge in the True Lord; they are not cast
        into the terrifying world-ocean again.  || 1 ||   Emotional attachment
        to Maya is total madness; through the love of duality, one is
        ruined. Mother and father  -  all are subject to this love;
        in this love, they are entangled. They are entangled in this love,
        on account of their past actions, which no one can erase. The
        One who created the Universe, beholds it; no other is as great
        as He. The blind, self-willed manmukh is consumed by his burning
        rage; without the Word of the Shabad, peace does not come. O Nanak,
        without the Name, everyone is deluded, ruined by emotional attachment
        to Maya.  || 2 ||   Seeing this world on fire, I have hurried
        to the Sanctuary of the Lord. I offer my prayer to the Perfect
        Guru: please save me, and bless me with Your glorious greatness.
        Preserve me in Your Sanctuary, and bless me with the glorious
        greatness of the Lord's Name; there is no other Giver as
        great as You. Those who are engaged in serving You are very fortunate;
        throughout the ages, they know the One Lord. You may practice
        celibacy, truth, austere self-discipline and rituals, but without
        the Guru, you shall not be emancipated. O Nanak, he alone understands
        the Word of the Shabad, who goes and seeks the Lord's Sanctuary.
        || 3 ||   That understanding, imparted by the Lord, wells up;
        there is no other understanding. Deep within, and beyond as well,
        You alone exist, O Lord; You Yourself impart this understanding.
        One whom He Himself blesses with this understanding, does not
        love any other. As Gurmukh, he tastes the subtle essence of the
        Lord. In the True Court, he is forever True; with love, he chants
        the True Word of the Shabad. </p>

        understanding is true and approved.  || 4 || 6 || </p>

        The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, dwells within my mind; it is the
        Destroyer of all pain. By great good fortune, I have obtained
        the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan; blessed, blessed
        is my True Guru. While standing up and sitting down, I serve the
        True Guru; serving Him, I have found peace and tranquility. My
        mind, my mind  -  the True Guru has blessed it with love. 
        || 1 ||   I live, I live, and I blossom forth, beholding the True
        Guru. The Name of the Lord, He has implanted the Name of the Lord
        within me; chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I blossom
        forth. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the heart-lotus
        blossoms forth, and through the Name of the Lord, I have obtained
        the nine treasures. The disease of egotism has been eradicated,
        suffering has been eliminated, and I have entered the Lord's
        state of celestial Samaadhi. I have obtained the glorious greatness
        of Name of the Lord from the True Guru; beholding the Divine True
        Guru, my mind is at peace. I live, I live, and I blossom forth,
        beholding the True Guru.  || 2 ||   If only someone would come,
        if only someone would come, and lead me to meet my Perfect True
        Guru. My mind and body, my mind and body  -  I cut my body
        into pieces, and I dedicate these to Him. Cutting my mind and
        body apart, cutting them into pieces, I offer these to the one,
        who recites to me the Words of the True Guru. My mind has become
        disillusioned and renounced the world; obtaining the Blessed Vision
        of the Guru's Darshan, it has found peace. O Lord, Har, Har,
        O Giver of Peace, please, grant Your Grace, and bless me with
        the dust of the feet of the True Guru. If only someone would come,
        if only someone would come, and lead me to meet my Perfect True
        Guru.  || 3 ||   A Giver as great as the Guru, as great as the
        Guru  -  I cannot see any other. He blesses me with the gift
        of the Lord's Name, the gift of the Lord's Name; He
        is the Immaculate Lord God. Those who worship in adoration the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har  -  their pain, doubt and fear are
        dispelled. Through their loving service, those very fortunate
        ones meet Him; their minds are attached to the Guru's Feet.
        Says Nanak, the Lord Himself causes us to meet the Guru; meeting
        the Almighty True Guru, peace is obtained. A Giver as great as
        the Guru, as great as the Guru  -  I cannot see any other.
        || 4 || 1 ||   WADAHANS,  FOURTH MEHL:  Without the Guru, I am
        -  without the Guru, I am totally dishonored. The Life of
        the world, the Life of the world, the Great Giver has led me to
        meet and merge with the Guru. Meeting the True Guru, I have merged
        into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I chant the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, and meditate on it. I was seeking and searching for
        Him, for the Lord, my best friend; I found Him within the home

        Meeting the Gursikhs, my faith is rewarded; night and day, I sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Those who have found the True
        Guru, the True Guru  -  the Lord God unites them in His Union.
        || 2 ||   I am a sacrifice, I am a sacrifice to the Gursikhs,
        my dear friends. They chant the Lord's Name, the Lord's
        Name; the Beloved Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my only Support.
        The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the companion of my breath
        of life; without it, I cannot live for an instant or a moment.
        The Lord, Har, Har, the Giver of peace, grants His Grace, and
        the Gurmukhs drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. The Lord blesses them
        with faith, and unites them in His Union; the Lord Himself adorns
        them. I am a sacrifice, I am a sacrifice to the Gursikhs, my dear
        friends.  || 3 ||   The Lord Himself, the Lord Himself  - 
        He is the Immaculate Almighty Lord God. The Lord Himself, the
        Lord Himself, unites us with Himself; that which He does, comes
        to pass. Whatever is pleasing to the Lord God, that alone comes
        to pass; nothing else can be done. Even by all sorts of clever
        tricks, He cannot be obtained; all have grown weary of practicing
        cleverness. By Guru's Grace, servant Nanak beholds Him; without
        the Lord, I have no other at all. The Lord Himself, the Lord Himself
        -  He is the Immaculate Almighty Lord God.  || 4 || 2 || 
        WADAHANS,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord, the True Guru, the Lord, the
        True Guru  -  if only I could meet the Lord, the True Guru;
        His Lotus Feet are so pleasing to me. The darkness of ignorance
        was dispelled when the Guru applied the healing ointment of spiritual
        wisdom to my eyes. The True Guru has applied the healing ointment
        of spiritual wisdom to my eyes, and the darkness of ignorance
        has been dispelled. Serving the True Guru, I have obtained the
        supreme status; I meditate on the Lord with every breath and morsel
        of food. Those, upon whom the Lord God has bestowed His Grace,
        are committed to the service of the True Guru. The Lord, the True
        Guru, the Lord, the True Guru  -  if only I could meet the
        Lord, the True Guru; His Lotus Feet are so pleasing to me.  ||
        1 ||   My True Guru, my True Guru is my Beloved; without the Guru,
        I cannot survive. He gives me the Name of the Lord, the Name of
        the Lord, my only companion in the end. The Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, is my only companion in the end; the Guru, the True
        Guru, has implanted the Naam within me. There, where neither your
        children nor your spouse shall accompany you, the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har shall emancipate you. Blessed, blessed is the True
        Guru, the Immaculate, Almighty Lord God; meeting Him, I meditate
        on the Name of the Lord. </p>

        cannot survive.  || 2 ||   Those who have not obtained the Blessed
        Vision, the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the True Guru, the
        Almighty Lord God  -  they have fruitlessly, uselessly wasted
        their whole lives in vain. They have wasted away their whole lives
        in vain; those faithless cynics die regretting and repenting.
        They have the jewel-treasure in their own homes, but still, they
        are hungry; those unlucky wretches are far away from the Lord.
        O Lord, please, let me not even have to look at those who do not
        meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and who have not obtained
        the Blessed Vision, the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the True

        Har, and the True Guru; the Lord God has granted His Grace. Without
        the Guru, I have no other friend. The Guru, the True Guru, is
        my very breath of life. Says Nanak, the Guru has implanted the
        Naam within me, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the True Name.
        I am a song-bird, I am a meek song-bird; I offer my prayer to

        about the sermon of the Lord. I ask about the sermon of the Lord
        from the True Guru, who has obtained the treasure of the Naam.
        I bow at His Feet constantly, and pray to Him; the Guru, the True
        Guru, has shown me the Way. He alone is a devotee, who looks alike
        upon pleasure and pain; he is imbued with the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har. O Lord, grant Your Grace, grant Your Grace, and let
        me meet the True Guru, the Giver of peace.  || 1 ||   Listen as

        Lord, Har, Har, are rid of their suffering and sins. The True
        Guru has placed the sword of spiritual wisdom in my hands; I have
        overcome and slain the Messenger of Death. The Lord God, the Giver
        of peace, has granted His Grace; I am rid of pain, sin and disease.

        the Lord; all egotism and sins are eradicated.  || 2 ||   Chanting
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, chanting the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind. Speaking as Gurmukh, speaking
        as Gurmukh, chanting and meditating, all disease is eradicated.
        Chanting and meditating as Gurmukh, all disease is eradicated,
        and the body becomes free of disease. Night and day, remain absorbed
        in the intuitive poise of Samaadhi; meditate on the Lord, the
        profound, unfathomable Lord. Whether of high or low social status,
        one who meditates on the Naam obtains the supreme treasure. </p>

        WADAHANS,  FOURTH MEHL,  GHOREES ~ THE WEDDING PROCESSION:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> This body-horse was created by the Lord. Blessed is human life,
        which is obtained by virtuous actions. Human life is obtained
        only by the most virtuous actions; this body is radiant and golden.
        The Gurmukh is imbued with the deep crimson color of the poppy;
        he is imbued with the new color of the Lord's Name, Har,
        Har, Har. This body is so very beautiful; it chants the Name of
        the Lord, and it is adorned with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        By great good fortune, the body is obtained; the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, is its companion; O servant Nanak, the Lord has created
        it.  || 1 ||   I place the saddle on the body-horse, the saddle
        of realization of the Good Lord. Riding this horse, I cross over
        the treacherous world-ocean. The treacherous world-ocean is rocked
        by countless waves, but the Gurmukh is carried across. Embarking
        upon the boat of the Lord, the very fortunate ones cross over;
        the Guru, the Boatman, carries them across, through the Word of
        the Shabad. Night and day, imbued with the Lord's Love, singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Lord's lover loves
        the Lord. Servant Nanak has attained the state of Nirvaanaa, the
        state of ultimate goodness, the state of the Lord.  || 2 ||  
        The Guru has implanted spiritual wisdom within me, as a bridle
        in my mouth. He has applied the whip of the Lord's Love to
        my body. Applying the whip of the Lord's Love to the body,
        the Gurmukh conquers the mind, and wins the battle of life. He
        trains his untrained mind with the Word of the Shabad, and drinks
        in the rejuvenating essence of the Lord's Nectar. Listen
        with your ears to the Word, spoken by the Guru, and attune your
        body-horse to the Lord's Love. Servant Nanak has crossed
        over on the path, the treacherous path.  || 3 ||   The body-horse
        was created by the Lord. Blessed, blessed is that body-horse which
        meditates on the Lord God. Blessed and acclaimed is that body-horse
        which meditates on the Lord God; it is obtained by the merits
        of past actions. Riding the body-horse, one crosses over the treacherous
        world-ocean; the Gurmukh meets the Lord, the embodiment of supreme
        bliss. The Lord, Har, Har, has perfectly arranged this wedding;
        the Saints have come together as a wedding party. Servant Nanak
        has obtained the Lord as his Spouse; joining together, the Saints
        sing the songs of joy and congratulations.  || 4 || 1 || 5 ||
        WADAHANS,  FOURTH MEHL:  The body is the Lord's horse,

      <p> I ask for the Lord's spiritual wisdom, and the Lord's
        sublime sermon; through the Name of the Lord, I have come to know
        His value and His state. The Creator has made my whole life fruitful;
        I chant the Name of the Lord. The Lord's humble servant begs
        for the Lord's Name, for the Lord's Praises, and for
        devotional worship of the Lord God. Says servant Nanak, listen,
        O Saints: devotional worship of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe,
        is good and sublime.  || 1 ||   The golden body is adorned with
        the saddle of gold. It is adorned with the jewel of the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har. Adorned with the jewel of the Naam, one obtains
        the Lord of the Universe; he meets the Lord and sings the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, obtaining all sorts of comforts. He obtains
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and meditates on the Name
        of the Lord; by great good fortune, he assumes the color of the
        Lord's Love. He meets his Lord and Master, the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts; His body is ever-new, and His color is
        ever-fresh. Nanak chants and realizes the Naam; he begs for the
        Name of the Lord, the Lord God.  || 2 ||   The Guru has placed
        the reins in the mouth of the body-horse. The mind-elephant is
        overpowered by the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The bride obtains
        the supreme status, as her mind is brought under control; she
        is the beloved of her Husband Lord. Deep within her inner being,
        she is in love with her Lord. In His home, she is so beautiful
        -  she is the bride of her Lord God. Attuned to the Lord's
        Love, she is intuitively absorbed in bliss; she obtains the Lord
        God, Har, Har. Servant Nanak, the Lord's slave, says that
        only the very fortunate meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3
        ||   The body is the horse, which one rides to the Lord. Meeting
        the True Guru, one sings the songs of joy. Sing the songs of joy
        to the Lord, serve the Name of the Lord, and become the servant
        of His servants. Go and enter the Mansion of God's Presence,
        and lovingly enjoy the Lord's Love. I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, so pleasing to my mind; following the Guru's
        Teachings, I meditate on the Lord within my mind. The Lord has
        showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; mounting the body-horse,
        he has found the Lord.  || 4 || 2 || 6 || </p>

      <p> Meeting the Guru, I have found my Beloved Lord. I have made this
        body and mind a sacrifice, a sacrificial offering to the Lord.
        Dedicating my body and mind, I have crossed over the terrifying
        world-ocean, and shaken off the fear of death. Drinking in the
        Ambrosial Nectar, I have become immortal; my comings and goings
        have ceased. I have found that home of celestial Samaadhi; the
        Name of the Lord is my only Support. Says Nanak, I enjoy peace
        and pleasure; I bow in reverence to the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||
        Listen, O my friend and companion  -  the Guru has given
        the Mantra of the Shabad, the True Word of God. Meditating on
        this True Shabad, I sing the songs of joy, and my mind is rid
        of anxiety. I have found that God, who never leaves; forever and
        ever, He sits with me. </p>

      <p> One who is pleasing to God receives true honor. The Lord God automatically
        blesses him with wealth. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to such
        a humble being. O Lord, You bless all with Your bountiful blessings.
        || 2 ||   When it pleases You, then I am satisfied and satiated.
        My mind is soothed and calmed, and all my thirst is quenched.
        My mind is soothed and calmed, the burning has ceased, and I have
        found all sorts of treasures. All the Sikhs and servants partake
        of them; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. I have become fearless,
        imbued with the Love of my Lord and Master; I have shaken off
        the fear of death. Slave Nanak, Your humble servant, lovingly
        embraces Your meditation; O Lord, please be with me always.  ||
        3 ||   My hopes and desires have been fulfilled, O my Lord. I
        am worthless, without virtue; all virtues are Yours, O Lord. All
        virtues are Yours, O my Lord and Master; with what mouth should
        I praise You? You did not consider my merits and demerits; you
        forgave me in an instant. I have obtained the nine treasures,
        congratulations are pouring in, and the unstruck melody resounds.
        Says Nanak, I have found my Husband Lord within my own home, and
        all my anxiety is forgotten.  || 4 || 1 ||   SHALOK:  Why do you
        listen to falsehood? It shall vanish like a gust of wind. O Nanak,
        those ears are acceptable, which listen to the True Master.  ||
        1 ||   CHHANT:  I am a sacrifice to those who listen to the Lord
        God with their ears. Intuitively embellished are those, who with
        their tongues chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. They are intuitively
        embellished with priceless virtues; they have come to save the
        world. God's Feet are the boat, which carries many across
        the terrifying world-ocean. Those who are blessed with the favor
        of my Lord and Master are not asked to render their account. Says
        Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who listen to God with their
        ears.  || 1 ||   SHALOK:  With my eyes, I have seen the Light,
        but my immense thirst is not quenched. O Nanak, those eyes are
        different, which behold my Husband Lord.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  I
        am a sacrifice to those who have seen the Lord God. In the True
        Court of the Lord, they are approved. They are approved by their
        Lord and Master, and acclaimed as supreme; they are attuned to
        the Lord's Love. They are satiated with the sublime essence
        of the Lord, and they merge in celestial peace; in each and every
        heart, they see the all-pervading Lord. They alone are the friendly
        Saints, and they alone are happy, who are pleasing to their Lord
        and Master. Says Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to those who
        have seen the Lord God.  || 2 ||   SHALOK:  The body is blind,
        totally blind and desolate, without the Naam. O Nanak, fruitful
        is the life of that being, within whose heart the True Lord and
        Master abides.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  I am cut into pieces as a sacrifice,
        to those who have seen my Lord God. His humble servants partake
        of the sweet Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord, Har, Har, and are satiated.
        The Lord seems sweet to their minds; God is merciful to them.
        His Ambrosial Nectar rains down upon them, and they are at peace.
        Pain is eliminated and doubt is dispelled from the body; meditating
        on the Lord of the World, their victory is celebrated. </p>

        their association with the five passions is broken off. Says Nanak,
        I am every bit a sacrifice to those, within whose hearts my Lord
        God abides.  || 3 ||   SHALOK:  Those who long for the Lord, are
        said to be His servants. Nanak knows this Truth, that the Lord
        is not separate from His Saints.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  As water
        mixes and blends with water, so does one's light mix and
        blend with the Light. Merging with the perfect, all-powerful Creator,
        one comes to know his own self. Then, one is intuitively absorbed
        in state of absolute Samaadhi, and one speaks of the One and Only
        Lord. He Himself is unmanifest, and He Himself is liberated; He
        Himself speaks of Himself. O Nanak, doubts, fears and the limitations
        of the three qualities are dispelled, as one merges, like water
        blending with water.  || 4 || 2 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  God
        is the all-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes. He preserves
        the whole world, reaching out with His hand. He is the all-powerful,
        safe Sanctuary, Lord and Master, Treasure of mercy, Giver of peace.
        I am a sacrifice to Your slaves, who recognize only the One Lord.
        His color and shape cannot be seen; His description is indescribable.
        Prays Nanak, hear my prayer, O God, Almighty Creator, Cause of
        causes.  || 1 ||   These beings are Yours; You are their Creator.
        God is the Destroyer of pain, suffering and doubt. Eliminate my
        doubt, pain and suffering in an instant, and preserve me, O Lord,
        Merciful to the meek. You are mother, father and friend, O Lord
        and Master; the whole world is Your child, O Lord of the World.
        One who comes seeking Your Sanctuary obtains the treasure of virtue,
        and does not have to enter the cycle of birth and death again.
        Prays Nanak, I am Your slave. All beings are Yours; You are their
        Creator.  || 2 ||   Meditate on the Lord, twenty-four hours a
        day; the fruits of the heart's desires are obtained. The
        heart's desires are obtained by meditating on God, and the
        fear of death is dispelled. I sing of the Lord of the Universe
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and my hopes are
        fulfilled. Renouncing possessiveness, emotional attachment and
        all corruption, we become pleasing to the Mind of God. Prays Nanak,
        day and night, meditate forever on the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||
        At His Door, the unstruck melody resounds. In each and every
        heart, the Lord, the Lord of the Universe, sings. The Lord of
        the Universe sings, and abides forever; He is unfathomable, profoundly
        deep, lofty and exalted. His virtues are infinite  -  none
        of them can be described. No one can reach Him. He Himself creates,
        and He Himself nurtures; all beings and creatures are fashioned
        by Him. Prays Nanak, peace comes from devotional worship of the
        Naam; at His Door, the unstruck melody resounds.  || 4 || 3 || </p>
