      <p> First, the teacher is tied down, and then, the noose is placed
        around the pupil's neck.  || 5 ||   Sassa:  You have lost
        your self-discipline, you fool, and you have accepted an offering
        under false pretenses. The daughter of the alms-giver is just
        like your own; by accepting this payment for performing the wedding
        ceremony, you have cursed your own life.  || 6 ||   Mamma:  You
        have been cheated out your intellect, you fool, and you are afflicted
        with the great disease of ego. Within your innermost self, you
        do not recognize God, and you compromise yourself for the sake
        of Maya.  || 7 ||   Kakka:  You wander around in sexual desire
        and anger, you fool; attached to possessiveness, you have forgotten
        the Lord. You read, and reflect, and proclaim out loud, but without
        understanding, you are drowned to death.  || 8 ||   Tatta:  In
        anger, you are burnt, you fool.   T'hat'ha:  That place
        where you live, is cursed.   Ghagha:  You go begging from door
        to door, you fool.   Dadda:  But still, you do not receive the
        gift.  || 9 ||   Pappa:  You shall not be able to swim across,
        you fool, since you are engrossed in worldly affairs. The True
        Lord Himself has ruined you, you fool; this is the destiny written
        on your forehead.  || 10 ||   Bhabha:  You have drowned in the
        terrifying world-ocean, you fool, and you have become engrossed
        in Maya. One who comes to know the One Lord, by Guru's Grace,
        is carried across in an instant.  || 11 ||   Wawa:  Your turn
        has come, you fool, but you have forgotten the Lord of Light.
        This opportunity shall not come again, you fool; you shall fall
        under the power of the Messenger of Death.  || 12 ||   Jhajha:
        You shall never have to regret and repent, you fool, if you listen
        to the Teachings of the True Guru, for even an instant.  Without
        the True Guru, there is no Guru at all; one who is without a Guru
        has a bad reputation.  || 13 ||   Dhadha:  Restrain your wandering
        mind, you fool; deep within you the treasure is to be found. When
        one becomes Gurmukh, then he drinks in the sublime essence of
        the Lord; throughout the ages, he continues to drink it in.  ||
        14 ||   Gagga:  Keep the Lord of the Universe in your mind, you
        fool; by mere words, no one has ever attained Him. Enshrine the
        Guru's feet within your heart, you fool, and all your past
        sins shall be forgiven.  || 15 ||   Haha:  Understand the Lord's
        Sermon, you fool; only then shall you attain eternal peace. The
        more the self-willed manmukhs read, the more pain they suffer.
        Without the True Guru, liberation is not obtained.  || 16 || 
        Rarra:  Center your consciousness on the Lord, you fool; abide
        with those whose hearts are filled with the Lord. By Guru's
        Grace, those who recognize the Lord, understand the absolute Lord.
        || 17 ||   Your limits cannot be known; the indescribable Lord
        cannot be described. O Nanak, whose who have met the True Guru,
        have their accounts settled.  || 18 || 2 || </p>

        RAAG AASAA,  FIRST MEHL,  CHHANT,  FIRST HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> O beautiful young bride, my Beloved Lord is very playful. When
        the bride enshrines great love for her Husband Lord, He becomes
        merciful, and loves her in return. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p> The soul-bride meets her Husband Lord, when the Lord Master Himself
        showers His favor upon her. Her bed is decorated in the company
        of her Beloved, and her seven pools are filled with ambrosial
        nectar. Be kind and compassionate to me, O Merciful True Lord,
        that I may obtain the Word of the Shabad, and sing Your Glorious
        Praises. O Nanak, gazing upon her Husband Lord, the soul-bride
        is delighted, and her mind is filled with joy.  || 1 ||   O bride
        of natural beauty, offer your loving prayers to the Lord. The
        Lord is pleasing to my mind and body; I am intoxicated in my Lord
        God's Company. Imbued with the Love of God, I pray to the
        Lord, and through the Lord's Name, I abide in peace. If you
        recognize His Glorious Virtues, then you shall come to know God;
        thus virtue shall dwell in you, and sin shall run away. Without
        You, I cannot survive, even for an instant; by merely talking
        and listening about You, I am not satisfied. Nanak proclaims,
  &quot;O Beloved, O Beloved!&quot; His tongue and mind are drenched
        with the Lord's sublime essence.  || 2 ||   O my companions
        and friends, my Husband Lord is the merchant. I have purchased
        the Lord's Name; its sweetness and value are unlimited. His
        value is invaluable; the Beloved dwells in His true home. If it
        is pleasing to God, then He blesses His bride. Some enjoy sweet
        pleasures with the Lord, while I stand crying at His door. The
        Creator, the Cause of causes, the All-powerful Lord Himself arranges
        our affairs. O Nanak, blessed is the soul-bride, upon whom He
        casts His Glance of Grace; she enshrines the Word of the Shabad
        in her heart.  || 3 ||   In my home, the true songs of rejoicing
        resound; the Lord God, my Friend, has come to me. He enjoys me,
        and imbued with His Love, I have captivated His heart, and given
        mine to Him. I gave my mind, and obtained the Lord as my Husband;
        as it pleases His Will, He enjoys me. I have placed my body and
        mind before my Husband Lord, and through the Shabad, I have been
        blessed. Within the home of my own self, I have obtained the ambrosial
        fruit. He is not obtained by intellectual recitation or great
        cleverness; only by love does the mind obtain Him. O Nanak, the
        Lord Master is my Best Friend; I am not an ordinary person.  ||
        4 || 1 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  The unstruck melody of the sound
        current resounds with the vibrations of the celestial instruments.
        My mind, my mind is imbued with the Love of my Darling Beloved.
        Night and day, my detached mind remains absorbed in the Lord,
        and I obtain my home in the profound trance of the celestial void.
        The True Guru has revealed to me the Primal Lord, the Infinite,
        my Beloved, the Unseen. The Lord's posture and His seat are
        permanent; my mind is absorbed in reflective contemplation upon
        Him. O Nanak, the detached ones are imbued with His Name, the
        unstruck melody, and the celestial vibrations.  || 1 ||   Tell
        me, how can I reach that unreachable, that unreachable city? By
        practicing truthfulness and self-restraint, by contemplating His
        Glorious Virtues, and living the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        Practicing the True Word of the Shabad, one comes to the home
        of his own inner being, and obtains the treasure of virtue. He
        has no stems, roots, leaves or branches, but He is the Supreme
        Lord over the heads of all. Practicing intensive meditation, chanting
        and self-discipline, people have grown weary; stubbornly practicing
        these rituals, they still have not found Him. O Nanak, through
        spiritual wisdom, the Lord, the Life of the world, is met; the
        True Guru imparts this understanding.  || 2 || </p>

      <p> The Guru is the ocean, the mountain of jewels, overflowing with
        jewels. Take your bath in the seven seas, O my mind, and become
        pure. One bathes in the water of purity when it is pleasing to
        God, and obtains the five virtues by reflective meditation. Renouncing
        sexual desire, anger, deceit and corruption, he enshrines the
        True Name in his heart. When the waves of ego, greed and avarice
        subside, he finds the Lord Master, Merciful to the meek. O Nanak,
        there is no place of pilgrimage comparable to the Guru; the True
        Guru is the Lord of the world.  || 3 ||   I have searched the
        jungles and forests, and looked upon all the fields. You created
        the three worlds, the entire universe, everything. You created
        everything; You alone are permanent. Nothing is equal to You.
        You are the Giver  -  all are Your beggars; without You, who
        should we praise? You bestow Your gifts, even when we do not ask
        for them, O Great Giver; devotion to You is a treasure over-flowing.
        Without the Lord's Name, there is no liberation; so says
        Nanak, the meek.  || 4 || 2 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  My mind,
        my mind is attuned to the Love of my Beloved Lord. The True Lord
        Master, the Primal Being, the Infinite One, is the Support of
        the earth. He is unfathomable, unapproachable, infinite and incomparable.
        He is the Supreme Lord God, the Lord above all. He is the Lord,
        from the beginning, throughout the ages, now and forevermore;
        know that all else is false. If one does not appreciate the value
        of good deeds and Dharmic faith, how can one obtain clarity of
        consciousness and liberation? O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the
        Word of the Shabad; night and day, he meditates on the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   My mind, my mind has come to accept,
        that the Naam is our only Friend. Egotism, worldly attachment,
        and the lures of Maya shall not go with you. Mother, father, famliy,
        children, cleverness, property and spouses  -  none of these
        shall go with you. I have renounced Maya, the daughter of the
        ocean; reflecting upon reality, I have trampled it under my feet.
        The Primal Lord has revealed this wondrous show; wherever I look,
        there I see Him. O Nanak, I shall not forsake the Lord's
        devotional worship; in the natural course, what shall be, shall
        be.  || 2 ||   My mind, my mind has become immaculately pure,
        contemplating the True Lord. I have dispelled my vices, and now
        I walk in the company of the virtuous. Discarding my vices, I
        do good deeds, and in the True Court, I am judged as true. My
        coming and going has come to an end; as Gurmukh, I reflect upon
        the nature of reality. O my Dear Friend, You are my all-knowing
        companion; grant me the glory of Your True Name. O Nanak, the
        jewel of the Naam has been revealed to me; such are the Teachings
        I have received from the Guru.  || 3 ||   I have carefully applied
        the healing ointment to my eyes, and I am attuned to the Immaculate
        Lord. He is permeating my mind and body, the Life of the world,
        the Lord, the Great Giver. My mind is imbued with the Lord, the
        Great Giver, the Life of the world; I have merged and blended
        with Him, with intuitive ease. In the Company of the Holy, and
        the Saints' Society, by God's Grace, peace is obtained.
        The renunciates remain absorbed in devotional worship to the Lord;
        they are rid of emotional attachment and desire. O Nanak, how
        rare is that unattached servant, who conquers his ego, and remains
        pleased with the Lord.  || 4 || 3 || 4 || 3 || </p>

      <p> You are everywhere, wherever I go, O True Creator Lord. You are
        the Giver of all, the Architect of Destiny, the Dispeller of distress.
        The Lord Master is the Dispeller of distress; all that happens
        is by His doing. Millions upon millions of sins, He destroys in
        an instant. He calls a swan a swan, and a crane a crane; He contemplates
        each and every heart. You are everywhere, wherever I go, O True
        Creator Lord.  || 1 ||   Those who meditate on Him single-mindedly
        obtain peace; how rare are they in this world. The Messenger of
        Death does not draw near those who live the Guru's Teachings;
        they never return defeated. Those who appreciate the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, never suffer defeat; the Messenger
        of Death does not even approach them. Birth and death are ended
        for those who are attached to the feet of the Lord. Through the
        Guru's Teachings, they obtain the sublime essence of the
        Lord, and the fruit of the Lord; they enshrine the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, in their hearts. Those who meditate on Him single-mindedly
        obtain peace; how rare are they in this world.  || 2 ||   He who
        created the world and assigned all to their tasks  -  unto
        Him I am a sacrifice. So serve Him, and gather profit, and you
        shall obtain honor in the Court of the Lord. That humble being,
        who recognizes the One Lord alone, obtains honor in the Court
        of the Lord. One who meditates on the Lord, through the Guru's
        Teachings, obtains the nine treasures; he chants and repeats continually
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Day and night, take the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, the most sublime Primal Being. The One who
        created the world and assigned all to their tasks  -  I am
        a sacrifice to Him.  || 3 ||   Those who chant the Naam look beautiful;
        they obtain the fruit of peace. Those who believe in the Name
        win the game of life. Their blessings are not exhausted, if it
        pleases the Lord, even though numerous ages may pass. Even though
        numerous ages may pass, O Lord Master, their blessings are not
        exhausted. They do not age, they do not die and fall into hell,
        if they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Those who
        chant the Lord's Name, Har, Har, do not wither, O Nanak;
        they are not afflicted by pain. Those who chant the Naam look
        beautiful; they obtain the fruit of peace. Those who believe in
        the Name win the game of life.  || 4 || 1 || 4 || </p>

      <p> Listen, O black deer: why are you so attached to the orchard of
        passion? The fruit of sin is sweet for only a few days, and then
        it grows hot and bitter. That fruit which intoxicated you has
        now become bitter and painful, without the Naam. </p>

      <p> It is temporary, like the waves on the sea, and the flash of lightning.
        Without the Lord, there is no other protector, but you have forgotten
        Him. Nanak speaks the Truth. Reflect upon it, O mind; you shall
        die, O black deer.  || 1 ||   O bumble bee, you wander among the
        flowers, but terrible pain awaits you. I have asked my Guru for
        true understanding. I have asked my True Guru for understanding
        about the bumble bee, who is so involved with the flowers of the
        garden. When the sun rises, the body will fall, and it will be
        cooked in hot oil. You shall be bound and beaten on the road of
        Death, without the Word of the Shabad, O madman. Nanak speaks
        the Truth. Reflect upon it, O mind; you shall die, O bumble bee.
        || 2 ||   O my stranger soul, why do you fall into entanglements?
        The True Lord abides within your mind; why are you trapped by
        the noose of Death? The fish leaves the water with tearful eyes,
        when the fisherman casts his net. The love of Maya is sweet to
        the world, but in the end, this delusion is dispelled. So perform
        devotional worship, link your consciousness to the Lord, and dispel
        anxiety from your mind. Nanak speaks the Truth; focus your consciousness
        on the Lord, O my stranger soul.  || 3 ||   The rivers and streams
        which separate may sometime be united again. In age after age,
        that which is sweet, is full of poison; how rare is the Yogi who
        understands this. That rare person who centers his consciousness
        on the True Guru, knows intuitively and realizes the Lord. Without
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the thoughtless fools wander in
        doubt, and are ruined. Those whose hearts are not touched by devotional
        worship and the Name of the True Lord, shall weep and wail loudly
        in the end. Nanak speaks the Truth; through the True Word of the
        Shabad, those long separated from the Lord, are united once again.

      <p> Within my home, the true wedding songs of rejoicing are sung;
        my home is adorned with the True Word of the Shabad. The soul-bride
        has met her Husband Lord; God Himself has consummated this union.
        God Himself has consummated this union; the soul-bride enshrines
        Truth within her mind, intoxicated with peaceful poise. Embellished
        with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and beautified with Truth,
        she enjoys her Beloved forever, imbued with His Love. Eradicating
        her ego, she obtains her Husband Lord, and then, the sublime essence
        of the Lord dwells within her mind. Says Nanak, fruitful and prosperous
        is her entire life; she is embellished with the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 1 ||   The soul-bride who has been led astray by duality
        and doubt, does not attain her Husband Lord. That soul-bride has
        no virtue, and she wastes her life in vain. The self-willed, ignorant
        and disgraceful manmukh wastes her life in vain, and in the end,
        she comes to grief. But when she serves her True Guru, she obtains
        peace, and then she meets her Husband Lord, face to face. Beholding
        her Husband Lord, she blossoms forth; her heart is delighted,
        and she is beautified by the True Word of the Shabad. O Nanak,
        without the Name, the soul-bride wanders around, deluded by doubt.
        Meeting her Beloved, she obtains peace. </p>

        The Shabad has quenched the fire of desire, and within her heart,
        peace and tranquility have come; she tastes the Lord's essence
        with intuitive ease. Meeting her Beloved, she enjoys His Love
        continually, and her speech rings with the True Shabad. Reading
        and studying continually, the Pandits, the religious scholars,
        and the silent sages have grown weary; wearing religious robes,
        liberation is not obtained. O Nanak, without devotional worship,
        the world has gone insane; through the True Word of the Shabad,
        one meets the Lord.  || 3 ||   Bliss permeates the mind of the

        her Beloved, her demerits were erased. That house, within which
        the Lord's Name is continually meditated upon, resounds with
        the wedding songs of rejoicing, throughout the four ages. O Nanak,
        imbued with the Naam, we are in bliss forever; meeting the Lord,
        our affairs are resolved.  || 4 || 1 || 6 || </p>

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> AASAA,  THIRD MEHL,  CHHANT,  THIRD HOUSE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> O my beloved friend, dedicate yourself to the devotional worship
        of your Husband Lord. Serve your Guru constantly, and obtain the
        wealth of the Naam. Dedicate yourself to the worship of your Husband
        Lord; this is pleasing to your Beloved Husband. If you walk in
        accordance with your own will, then your Husband Lord will not
        be pleased with you. This path of loving devotional worship is
        very difficult; how rare are those who find it, through the Gurdwara,
        the Guru's Gate. Says Nanak, that one, upon whom the Lord
        casts His Glance of Grace, links his consciousness to the worship
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O my detached mind, unto whom do you show
        your detachment? Those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
        live in the joy of the Lord, forever and ever. So become detached,
        and renounce hypocrisy; Your Husband Lord knows everything. The
        One Lord is pervading the water, the land and the sky; the Gurmukh
        realizes the Command of His Will. One who realizes the Lord's
        Command, obtains all peace and comforts. Thus says Nanak: such
        a detached soul remains absorbed in the Lord's Love, day
        and night.  || 2 ||   Wherever you wander, O my mind, the Lord
        is there with you. Renounce your cleverness, O my mind, and reflect
        upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Your Husband Lord is
        always with you, if you remember the Lord's Name, even for
        an instant. The sinful residues of countless incarnations shall
        be washed away, and in the end, you shall obtain the supreme status.
        You shall be linked to the True Lord, and as Gurmukh, remember
        Him forever. Thus says Nanak: wherever you go, O my mind, the
        Lord is there with you.  || 3 ||   Meeting the True Guru, the
        wandering mind is held steady; it comes to abide in its own home.
        It purchases the Naam, chants the Naam, and remains absorbed in
        the Naam. </p>

      <p> The outgoing, wandering soul, upon meeting the True Guru, opens
        the Tenth Gate. There, Ambrosial Nectar is food and the celestial
        music resounds; the world is held spell-bound by the music of
        the Word. The many strains of the unstruck melody resound there,
        as one merges in Truth. Thus says Nanak: by meeting the True Guru,
        the wandering soul becomes steady, and comes to dwell in the home
        of its own self.  || 4 ||   O my mind, you are the embodiment
        of the Divine Light  -  recognize your own origin. O my mind,
        the Dear Lord is with you; through the Guru's Teachings,
        enjoy His Love. Acknowledge your origin, and then you shall know
        your Husband Lord, and so understand death and birth. By Guru's
        Grace, know the One; then, you shall not love any other. Peace
        comes to the mind, and gladness resounds; then, you shall be acclaimed.
        Thus says Nanak: O my mind, you are the very image of the Luminous
        Lord; recognize the true origin of your self.  || 5 ||   O mind,
        you are so full of pride; loaded with pride, you shall depart.
        The fascinating Maya has fascinated you, over and over again,
        and lured you into reincarnation. Clinging to pride, you shall
        depart, O foolish mind, and in the end, you shall regret and repent.
        You are afflicted with the diseases of ego and desire, and you
        are wasting your life away in vain. The foolish self-willed manmukh
        does not remember the Lord, and shall regret and repent hereafter.
        Thus says Nanak: O mind, you are full of pride; loaded with pride,
        you shall depart.  || 6 ||   O mind, don't be so proud of
        yourself, as if you know it all; the Gurmukh is humble and modest.
        Within the intellect are ignorance and ego; through the True Word
        of the Shabad, this filth is washed off. So be humble, and surrender
        to the True Guru; do not attach your identity to your ego. The
        world is consumed by ego and self-identity; see this, lest you
        lose your own self as well. Make yourself follow the Sweet Will
        of the True Guru; remain attached to His Sweet Will. Thus says
        Nanak: renounce your ego and self-conceit, and obtain peace; let
        your mind abide in humility.  || 7 ||   Blessed is that time,
        when I met the True Guru, and my Husband Lord came into my consciousness.
        I became so very blissful, and my mind and body found such a natural
        peace. My Husband Lord came into my consciousness; I enshrined
        Him within my mind, and I renounced all vice. When it pleased
        Him, virtues appeared in me, and the True Guru Himself adorned
        me. Those humble beings become acceptable, who cling to the One
        Name and renounce the love of duality. Thus says Nanak: blessed
        is the time when I met the True Guru, and my Husband Lord came
        into my consciousness.  || 8 ||   Some people wander around, deluded
        by doubt; their Husband Lord Himself has misled them. They wander
        around in the love of duality, and they do their deeds in ego.
        Their Husband Lord Himself has misled them, and put them on the
        path of evil. Nothing lies in their power. You alone know their
        ups and downs, You, who created the creation. The Command of Your
        Will is very strict; how rare is the Gurmukh who understands. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Thus says Nanak: what can the poor creatures do, when You mislead
        them into doubt?  || 9 ||   O My True Lord Master, True is Your
        glorious greatness. You are the Supreme Lord God, the Infinite
        Lord and Master. Your creative power cannot be described. True
        is Your glorious greatness; when You enshrine it within the mind,
        one sings Your Glorious Praises forever. He sings Your Glorious
        Praises, when it is pleasing to You, O True Lord; he centers his
        consciousness on You. One whom You unite with Yourself, as Gurmukh,
        remains absorbed in You. Thus says Nanak:  O my True Lord Master,
        True is Your Glorious Greatness.  || 10 || 2 || 7 || 5 || 2 ||

        RAAG AASAA,  CHHANT,  FOURTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Life  -  I have found real life, as Gurmukh, through His Love.
        The Lord's Name  -  He has given me the Lord's Name,
        and enshrined it within my breath of life. He has enshrined the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har within my breath of lfe, and all my
        doubts and sorrows have departed. I have meditated on the invisible
        and unapproachable Lord, through the Guru's Word, and I have
        obtained the pure, supreme status. The unstruck melody resounds,
        and the instruments ever vibrate, singing the Bani of the True
        Guru. O Nanak, God the Great Giver has given me a gift; He has
        blended my light into the Light.  || 1 ||   The self-willed manmukhs
        die in their self-willed stubbornness, declaring that the wealth
        of Maya is theirs. They attach their consciousness to the foul-smelling
        pile of filth, which comes for a moment, and departs in an instant.
        They attach their consciousness to the foul-smelling pile of filth,
        which is transitory, like the fading color of the safflower. One
        moment, they are facing east, and the next instant, they are facing
        west; they continue spinning around, like the potter's wheel.
        In sorrow, they eat, and in sorrow, they gather things and try
        to enjoy them, but they only increase their stores of sorrow.
        O Nanak, one easily crosses over the terrifying world-ocean, when
        he comes to the Sanctuary of the Guru.  || 2 ||   My Lord, my
        Lord Master is sublime, unapproachable and unfathomable. The wealth
        of the Lord  -  I seek the wealth of the Lord, from my True
        Guru, the Divine Banker. I seek the wealth of the Lord, to purchase
        the Naam; I sing and love the Glorious Praises of the Lord. I
        have totally renounced sleep and hunger, and through deep meditation,
        I am absorbed into the Absolute Lord. The traders of one kind
        come and take away the Name of the Lord as their profit. O Nanak,
        dedicate your mind and body to the Guru; one who is so destined,
        attains it.  || 3 ||   The great ocean is full of the treasures
        of jewels upon jewels. Those who are committed to the Word of
        the Guru's Bani, see them come into their hands. This priceless,
        incomparable jewel comes into the hands of those who are committed
        to the Word of the Guru's Bani. They obtain the immeasurable
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har; their treasure is overflowing with
        devotional worship. I have churned the ocean of the body, and
        I have seen the incomparable thing come into view. The Guru is
        God, and God is the Guru, O Nanak; there is no difference between
        the two, O Siblings of Destiny.  || 4 || 1 || 8 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  Slowly, slowly, slowly, very slowly, the drops of Ambrosial
        Nectar trickle down. </p>

      <p> As Gurmukh, the Gurmukh beholds the Lord, the Beloved Lord. The
        Name of the Lord, the Emancipator of the world, is dear to him;
        the Name of the Lord is his glory. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,
        the Lord's Name is the boat, which carries the Gurmukh across.
        This world, and the world hereafter, are adorned with the Lord's
        Name; the Gurmukh's lifestyle is the most excellent. O Nanak,
        bestowing His kindness, the Lord gives the gift of His emancipating
        Name.  || 1 ||   I chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, which
        destroys my sorrows and erases my sins. Associating with the Guru,
        associating with the Guru, I practice meditation; I have enshrined
        the Lord within my heart. I enshrined the Lord within my heart,
        and obtained the supreme status, when I came to the Sanctuary
        of the Guru. My boat was sinking under the weight of greed and
        corruption, but it was uplifted when the True Guru implanted the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me. The Perfect Guru has given
        me the gift of spiritual life, and I center my consciousness on
        the Lord's Name. The Merciful Lord Himself has mercifully
        given this gift to me; O Nanak, I take to the Sanctuary of the
        Guru.  || 2 ||   Hearing the Bani of the Lord's Name, all
        my affairs were brought to perfection and embellished. With each
        and every hair, with each and every hair, as Gurmukh, I meditate
        on the Lord. I meditate on the Lord's Name, and become pure;
        He has no form or shape. The Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, is
        permeating my heart deep within, and all of my desire and hunger
        has disappeared. My mind and body are totally adorned with peace
        and tranquility; through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord has
        been revealed to me. The Lord Himself has shown His kind mercy
        to Nanak; He has made me the slave of the slaves of His slaves.
        || 3 ||   Those who forget the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam,
        are foolish, unfortunate, self-willed manmukhs. Within, they are
        engrossed in emotional attachment; each and every moment, Maya
        clings to them. The filth of Maya clings to them, and they become
        unfortunate fools  -  they do not love the Lord's Name.
        The egotistical and proud perform all sorts of rituals, but they
        shy away from the Lord's Name. The path of Death is very
        arduous and painful; it is stained with the darkness of emotional
        attachment. O Nanak, the Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and finds
        the gate of salvation.  || 4 ||   The Name of the Lord, Raam,
        Raam, and the Lord Guru, are known by the Gurmukh. One moment,
        this mind is in the heavens, and the next, it is in the nether
        regions; the Guru brings the wandering mind back to one-pointedness.
        When the mind returns to one-pointedness, one totally understands
        the value of salvation, and enjoys the subtle essence of the Lord's
        Name. The Lord's Name preserves the honor of His servant,
        as He preserved and emancipated Prahlaad. So repeat continually
        the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam; chanting His Glorious Virtues,
        His limit cannot be found. Nanak is drenched in happiness, hearing
        the Name of the Lord; he is merged in the Name of the Lord.  ||
        5 ||   Those beings, whose minds are filled the Lord's Name,
        forsake all anxiety. They obtain all wealth, and all Dharmic faith,
        and the fruits of their minds' desires. They obtain the fruits
        of their hearts' desires, meditating on the Lord's Name,
        and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name. Evil-mindedness
        and duality depart, and their understanding is enlightened. </p>

      <p> They attach their minds to the Name of the Lord. Their lives and
        bodies become totally blessed and fruitful; the Lord's Name
        illumines them. O Nanak, by continually vibrating upon the Lord,
        day and night, the Gurmukhs abide in the home of the inner self.
        || 6 ||   Those who place their faith in the Lord's Name,
        do not attach their consciousness to another. Even if the entire
        earth were to be transformed into gold, and given to them, without
        the Naam, they love nothing else. The Lord's Name is pleasing
        to their minds, and they obtain supreme peace; when they depart
        in the end, it shall go with them as their support. I have gathered
        the capital, the wealth of the Lord's Name; it does not sink,
        and does not depart. The Lord's Name is the only true support
        in this age; the Messenger of Death does not draw near it. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukhs recognize the Lord; in His Mercy, He unites them
        with Himself.  || 7 ||   True, True is the Name of the Lord, Raam,
        Raam; the Gurmukh knows the Lord. The Lord's servant is the
        one who commits himself to the Guru's service, and dedicates
        his mind and body as an offering to Him. He dedicates his mind
        and body to Him, placing great faith in Him; the Guru lovingly
        unites His servant with Himself. The Master of the meek, the Giver
        of souls, is obtained through the Perfect Guru. The Guru's
        Sikh, and the Sikh's Guru, are one and the same; both spread
        the Guru's Teachings. The Mantra of the Lord's Name
        is enshrined within the heart, O Nanak, and we merge with the
        Lord so easily.  || 8 || 2 || 9 || </p>

        are eradicated, and one comes to sleep in peaceful ease. O Lord,
        O Lord and Master, shower Your Mercy upon me; within my mind,

        10 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, everyone
        embodied contentment and meditation; religion stood upon four
        feet. With mind and body, they sang of the Lord, and attained
        supreme peace. In their hearts was the spiritual wisdom of the
        Lord's Glorious Virtues. Their wealth was the spiritual wisdom
        of the Lord's Glorious Virtues; the Lord was their success,
        and to live as Gurmukh was their glory. Inwardly and outwardly,
        they saw only the One Lord God; for them there was no other second.
        They centered their consciousness lovingly on the Lord, Har, Har.
        The Lord's Name was their companion, and in the Court of
        the Lord, they obtained honor. In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga,
        everyone embodied contentment and meditation; religion stood upon
        four feet.  || 1 ||   Then came the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga;
        men's minds were ruled by power, and they practiced celibacy
        and self-discipline. The fourth foot of religion dropped off,
        and three remained. Their hearts and minds were inflamed with
        anger. Their hearts and minds were filled with the horribly poisonous
        essence of anger. The kings fought their wars and obtained only
        pain. Their minds were afflicted with the illness of egotism,
        and their self-conceit and arrogance increased. If my Lord, Har,
        Har, shows His Mercy, my Lord and Master eradicates the poison
        by the Guru's Teachings and the Lord's Name. Then came
        the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga; men's minds were ruled by
        power, and they practiced celibacy and self-discipline.  || 2
        ||   The Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga came, and people wandered in
        doubt. The Lord created the Gopis and Krishna. The penitents practiced
        penance, they offered sacred feasts and charity, and performed
        many rituals and religious rites. They performed many rituals
        and religious rites; two legs of religion dropped away, and only
        two legs remained. So many heroes waged great wars; in their egos
        they were ruined, and they ruined others as well. The Lord, Compassionate
        to the poor, led them to meet the Holy Guru.  Meeting the True
        Guru, their filth is washed away. The Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga
        came, and the people wandered in doubt. <br>
