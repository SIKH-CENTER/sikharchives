      <p> <font color="#000000">Among the months, blessed is this month, when
        spring always comes. Blossom forth, O my consciousness, contemplating
        the Lord of the Universe, forever and ever.  || 1 ||   O ignorant
        one, forget your egotistical intellect. Subdue your ego, and contemplate
        Him in your mind; gather in the virtues of the Sublime, Virtuous
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Karma is the tree, the Lord's
        Name the branches, Dharmic faith the flowers, and spiritual wisdom
        the fruit. Realization of the Lord are the leaves, and eradication
        of the pride of the mind is the shade.  || 2 ||   Whoever sees
        the Lord's Creative Power with his eyes, and hears the
        Guru's Bani with his ears, and utters the True Name with
        his mouth, attains the perfect wealth of honor, and intuitively
        focuses his meditation on the Lord.  || 3 ||   The months and
        the seasons come; see, and do your deeds. O Nanak, those Gurmukhs
        who remain merged in the Lord do not wither away; they remain
        green forever.  || 4 || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL,  BASANT:  The season
        of spring, so delightful, has come. Those who are imbued with
        love for You, O Lord, chant Your Name with joy. Whom else should
        I worship? At whose feet should I bow?  || 1 ||   I am the slave
        of Your slaves, O my Sovereign Lord King. O Life of the Universe,
        there is no other way to meet You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You have
        only One Form, and yet You have countless forms. Which one should
        I worship? Before which one should I burn incense? Your limits
        cannot be found. How can anyone find them? I am the slave of Your
        slaves, O my Sovereign Lord King.  || 2 ||   The cycles of years
        and the places of pilgrimage are Yours, O Lord. Your Name is True,
        O Transcendent Lord God. Your State cannot be known, O Eternal,
        Unchanging Lord God. Although You are unknown, still we chant
        Your Name.  || 3 ||   What can poor Nanak say? All people praise
        the One Lord. Nanak places his head on the feet of such people.
        I am a sacrifice to Your Names, as many as there are, O Lord.
        || 4 || 2 ||   BASANT,  FIRST MEHL:  The kitchen is golden, and
        the cooking pots are golden. The lines marking the cooking square
        are silver. The water is from the Ganges, and the firewood is
        sanctified. The food is soft rice, cooked in milk. || 1 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> O my mind, these things are worthless, if you are not drenched
        with the True Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One may have the eighteen
        Puraanas written in his own hand; he may recite the four Vedas
        by heart, and take ritual baths at holy festivals and give charitable
        donations; he may observe the ritual fasts, and perform religious
        ceremonies day and night.  || 2 ||   He may be a Qazi, a Mullah
        or a Shaykh, a Yogi or a wandering hermit wearing saffron-colored
        robes; he may be a householder, working at his job; but without
        understanding the essence of devotional worship, all people are
        eventually bound and gagged, and driven along by the Messenger
        of Death.  || 3 ||   Each person's karma is written on
        his forehead. According to their deeds, they shall be judged.
        Only the foolish and the ignorant issue commands. O Nanak, the
        treasure of praise belongs to the True Lord alone.  || 4 || 3
        ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  A person may take off his clothes and
        be naked. What Yoga does he practice by having matted and tangled
        hair? If the mind is not pure, what use is it to hold the breath
        at the Tenth Gate? The fool wanders and wanders, entering the
        cycle of reincarnation again and again.  || 1 ||   Meditate on
        the One Lord, O my foolish mind, and you shall cross over to the
        other side in an instant.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Some recite and
        expound on the Simritees and the Shaastras; some sing the Vedas
        and read the Puraanas; but they practice hypocrisy and deception
        with their eyes and minds. The Lord does not even come near them.
        || 2 ||   Even if someone practices such self-discipline, compassion
        and devotional worship - if he is filled with greed, and
        his mind is engrossed in corruption, how can he find the Immaculate
        Lord?  || 3 ||   What can the created being do? The Lord Himself
        moves him. If the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then his doubts
        are dispelled. If the mortal realizes the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command, he obtains the True Lord.  || 4 ||   If someone's
        soul is polluted within, what is the use of his traveling to sacred
        shrines of pilgrimage all over the world? O Nanak, when one joins
        the Society of the True Guru, then the bonds of the terrifying
        world-ocean are broken.  || 5 || 4 ||   BASANT,  FIRST MEHL: 
        All the worlds have been fascinated and enchanted by Your Maya,
        O Lord. I do not see any other at all - You are everywhere.
        You are the Master of Yogis, the Divinity of the divine. Serving
        at the Guru's Feet, the Name of the Lord is received. 
        || 1 ||   O my Beauteous, Deep and Profound Beloved Lord. As Gurmukh,
        I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name. You are
        Infinite, the Cherisher of all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without
        the Holy Saint, association with the Lord is not obtained. Without
        the Guru, one's very fiber is stained with filth. Without
        the Lord's Name, one cannot become pure. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, sing the Praises of the True Lord.
        || 2 ||   O Savior Lord, that person whom You have saved -
        You lead him to meet the True Guru, and so take care of him. You
        take away his poisonous egotism and attachment. You dispel all
        his sufferings, O Sovereign Lord God.  || 3 ||   His state and
        condition are sublime; the Lord's Glorious Virtues permeate
        his body. Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, the
        diamond of the Lord's Name is revealed. He is lovingly
        attuned to the Naam; he is rid of the love of duality. O Lord,
        let servant Nanak meet the Guru.  || 4 || 5 ||   BASANT,  FIRST
        MEHL:  O my friends and companions, listen with love in your heart.
        My Husband Lord is Incomparably Beautiful; He is always with me.
        He is Unseen - He cannot be seen. How can I describe Him? <br>

      </p>
      <p> The Guru has shown me that my Sovereign Lord God is with me. 
        || 1 ||   Joining together with my friends and companions, I am
        adorned with the Lord's Glorious Virtues. The sublime soul-brides
        play with their Lord God. The Gurmukhs look within themselves;
        their minds are filled with faith.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed
        manmukhs, suffering in separation, do not understand this mystery.
        The Beloved Lord of all celebrates in each and every heart. The
        Gurmukh is stable, knowing that God is always with him. The Guru
        has implanted the Naam within me; I chant it, and meditate on
        it.  || 2 ||   Without the Guru, devotional love does not well
        up within. Without the Guru, one is not blessed with the Society
        of the Saints. Without the Guru, the blind cry out, entangled
        in worldly affairs. That mortal who becomes Gurmukh becomes immaculate;
        the Word of the Shabad washes away his filth.  || 3 ||   Uniting
        with the Guru, the mortal conquers and subdues his mind. Day and
        night, he savors the Yoga of devotional worship. Associating with
        the Saint Guru, suffering and sickness are ended. Servant Nanak
        merges with his Husband Lord, in the Yoga of intuitive ease. 
        || 4 || 6 ||   BASANT,  FIRST MEHL:  By His Creative Power, God
        fashioned the creation. The King of kings Himself adminsters true
        justice. The most sublime Word of the Guru's Teachings
        is always with us. The wealth of the Lord's Name, the source
        of nectar, is easily acquired.  || 1 ||   So chant the Name of
        the Lord; do not forget it, O my mind. The Lord is Infinite, Inaccessible
        and Incomprehensible; His weight cannot be weighed, but He Himself
        allows the Gurmukh to weigh Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your GurSikhs
        serve at the Guru's Feet. Serving the Guru, they are carried
        across; they have abandoned any distinction between 'mine'
        and 'yours'. The slanderous and greedy people are
        hard-hearted. Those who do not love to serve the Guru are the
        most thieving of thieves.  || 2 ||   When the Guru is pleased,
        He blesses the mortals with loving devotional worship of the Lord.
        When the Guru is pleased, the mortal obtains a place in the Mansion
        of the Lord's Presence. So renounce slander, and awaken
        in devotional worship of the Lord. Devotion to the Lord is wonderful;
        it comes through good karma and destiny.  || 3 ||   The Guru unites
        in union with the Lord, and grants the gift of the Name. The Guru
        loves His Sikhs, day and night. They obtain the fruit of the Naam,
        when the Guru's favor is bestowed. Says Nanak, those who
        receive it are very rare indeed.  || 4 || 7 ||   BASANT,  THIRD
        MEHL,  IK-TUKAS:  When it pleases our Lord and Master, His servant
        serves Him. He remains dead while yet alive, and redeems all his
        ancestors.  || 1 ||   I shall not renounce Your devotional worship,
        O Lord; what does it matter if people laugh at me? The True Name
        abides within my heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Just as the mortal
        remains engrossed in attachment to Maya, so does the Lord's
        humble Saint remain absorbed in the Lord's Name.  || 2
        ||   I am foolish and ignorant, O Lord; please be merciful to
        me. May I remain in Your Sanctuary.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, worldly
        affairs are fruitless. Only by Guru's Grace does one receive
        the Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 8 || <br>

      <p> Build your boat, and pray, &quot;O Merciful Lord, please be
        merciful to me.&quot;  || 1 ||   Why do you irrigate the barren,
        alkaline soil? You are wasting your life away! This wall of mud
        is crumbling. Why bother to patch it with plaster?  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Let your hands be the buckets, strung on the chain, and
        yoke the mind as the ox to pull it; draw the water up from the
        well. Irrigate your fields with the Ambrosial Nectar, and you
        shall be owned by God the Gardener.  || 2 ||   Let sexual desire
        and anger be your two shovels, to dig up the dirt of your farm,
        O Siblings of Destiny. The more you dig, the more peace you shall
        find. Your past actions cannot be erased.  || 3 ||   The crane
        is again transformed into a swan, if You so will, O Merciful Lord.
        Prays Nanak, the slave of Your slaves: O Merciful Lord, have mercy
        on me.  || 4 || 1 || 9 ||   BASANT,  FIRST MEHL,  HINDOL:  In
        the House of the Husband Lord - in the world hereafter,
        everything is jointly owned; but in this world - in the
        house of the soul-bride's parents, the soul-bride owns
        them separately. She herself is ill-mannered; how can she blame
        anyone else? She does not know how to take care of these things.
        || 1 ||   O my Lord and Master, I am deluded by doubt. I sing
        the Word which You have written; I do not know any other Word.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   She alone is known as the Lord's
        bride, who embroiders her gown in the Name. She who preserves
        and protects the home of her own heart and does not taste of evil,
        shall be the Beloved of her Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   If you are
        a learned and wise religious scholar, then make a boat of the
        letters of the Lord's Name. Prays Nanak, the One Lord shall
        carry you across, if you merge in the True Lord.  || 3 || 2 ||
        10 ||   BASANT HINDOL,  FIRST MEHL:  The king is just a boy, and
        his city is vulnerable. He is in love with his wicked enemies.
        He reads of his two mothers and his two fathers; O Pandit, reflect
        on this.  || 1 ||   O Master Pandit, teach me about this. How
        can I obtain the Lord of life?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There is
        fire within the plants which bloom; the ocean is tied into a bundle.
        The sun and the moon dwell in the same home in the sky. You have
        not obtained this knowledge.  || 2 ||   One who knows the All-pervading
        Lord, eats up the one mother - Maya. Know that the sign
        of such a person is that he gathers the wealth of compassion.
        || 3 ||   The mind lives with those who do not listen, and do
        not admit what they eat. Prays Nanak, the slave of the Lord's
        slave: one instant the mind is huge, and the next instant, it
        is tiny.  || 4 || 3 || 11 ||   BASANT HINDOL,  FIRST MEHL:  The
        Guru is the True Banker, the Giver of peace; He unites the mortal
        with the Lord, and satisfies his hunger. Granting His Grace, He
        implants devotional worship of the Lord within; and then night
        and day, we sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||  
        O my mind, do not forget the Lord; keep Him in your consciousness.
        Without the Guru, no one is liberated anywhere in the three worlds.
        The Gurmukh obtains the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Without devotional worship, the True Guru is not obtained. Without
        good destiny, devotional worship of the Lord is not obtained.
        Without good destiny, the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, is
        not obtained. By the grace of one's good karma, the Lord's
        Name is received.  || 2 ||   In each and every heart, the Lord
        is hidden; He creates and watches over all. He reveals Himself
        in the humble, Saintly Gurmukhs. Those who chant the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, are drenched with the Lord's Love. <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Throughout the months and the seasons, the
        Lord is always in bloom. He rejuvenates all beings and creatures.
        What can I say? I am just a worm. No one has found Your beginning
        or Your end, O Lord.  || 1 ||   Those who serve You, Lord, obtain
        the greatest peace; their souls are so divine.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   If the Lord is merciful, then the mortal is allowed to serve
        Him. By Guru's Grace, he remains dead while yet alive.
        Night and day, he chants the True Name; in this way, he crosses
        over the treacherous world-ocean.  || 2 ||   The Creator created
        both poison and nectar. He attached these two fruits to the world-plant.
        The Creator Himself is the Doer, the Cause of all. He feeds all
        as He pleases.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, when He casts His Glance of
        Grace, He Himself bestows His Ambrosial Naam. Thus, the desire
        for sin and corruption is ended. The Lord Himself carries out
        His Own Will.  || 4 || 1 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who
        are attuned to the True Lord's Name are happy and exalted.
        Take pity on me, O God, Merciful to the meek. Without Him, I have
        no other at all. As it pleases His Will, He keeps me.  || 1 ||
        The Guru, the Lord, is pleasing to my mind. I cannot even survive,
        without the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. But I shall easily
        unite with the Guru, if He unites me in His Union.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The greedy mind is enticed by greed. Forgetting the Lord,
        it regrets and repents in the end. The separated ones are reunited,
        when they are inspired to serve the Guru. They are blessed with
        the Lord's Name - such is the destiny written on
        their foreheads.  || 2 ||   This body is built of air and water.
        The body is afflicted with the terribly painful illness of egotism.
        The Gurmukh has the Medicine: singing the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord's Name. Granting His Grace, the Guru has cured
        the illness.  || 3 ||   The four evils are the four rivers of
        fire flowing through the body. It is burning in desire, and burning
        in egotism. Those whom the Guru protects and saves are very fortunate.
        Servant Nanak enshrines the Ambrosial Name of the Lord in his
        heart.  || 4 || 2 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  One who serves the
        Lord is the Lord's person. He dwells in intuitive peace,
        and never suffers in sorrow. The self-willed manmukhs are dead;
        the Lord is not within their minds. They die and die again and
        again, and are reincarnated, only to die once more.  || 1 || 
        They alone are alive, whose minds are filled with the Lord. They
        contemplate the True Lord, and are absorbed in the True Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who do not serve the Lord are far
        away from the Lord. They wander in foreign lands, with dust thrown
        on their heads. The Lord Himself enjoins His humble servants to
        serve Him. <br>

      <p> They live in peace forever, and have no greed at all.  || 2 ||
        When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, egotism is eradicated.
        Then, the mortal is honored in the Court of the True Lord. He
        sees the Dear Lord always close at hand, ever-present. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he sees the Lord pervading
        and permeating all.  || 3 ||   The Lord cherishes all beings and
        creatures. By Guru's Grace, contemplate Him forever. You
        shall go to your true home in the Lord's Court with honor.
        O Nanak, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you shall be
        blessed with glorious greatness.  || 4 || 3 ||   BASANT,  THIRD
        MEHL:  One who worships the Lord within his mind, sees the One
        and Only Lord, and no other. People in duality suffer terrible
        pain. The True Guru has shown me the One Lord.  || 1 ||   My God
        is in bloom, forever in spring. This mind blossoms forth, singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   So consult the Guru, and reflect upon His wisdom; then,
        you shall be in love with the True Lord God. Abandon your self-conceit,
        and be His loving servant. Then, the Life of the World shall come
        to dwell in your mind.  || 2 ||   Worship Him with devotion, and
        see Him always ever-present, close at hand. My God is forever
        permeating and pervading all. Only a rare few know the mystery
        of this devotional worship. My God is the Enlightener of all souls.
        || 3 ||   The True Guru Himself unites us in His Union. He Himself
        links our consciousness to the Lord, the Life of the World. Thus,
        our minds and bodies are rejuvenated with intuitive ease. O Nanak,
        through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, we remain attuned to the
        String of His Love.  || 4 || 4 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  The
        Lord is the Lover of His devotees; He dwells within their minds,
        by Guru's Grace, with intuitive ease. Through devotional
        worship, self-conceit is eradicated from within, and then, one
        meets the True Lord.  || 1 ||   His devotees are forever beauteous
        at the Door of the Lord God. Loving the Guru, they have love and
        affection for the True Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That humble
        being who worships the Lord with devotion becomes immaculate and
        pure. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, egotism is
        eradicated from within. The Dear Lord Himself comes to dwell within
        the mind, and the mortal remains immersed in peace, tranquility
        and intuitive ease.  || 2 ||   Those who are imbued with Truth,
        are forever in the bloom of spring. Their minds and bodies are
        rejuvenated, uttering the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
        Universe. Without the Lord's Name, the world is dry and
        parched. It burns in the fire of desire, over and over again.
        || 3 ||   One who does only that which is pleasing to the Dear
        Lord - his body is forever at peace, and his consciousness
        is attached to the Lord's Will. He serves His God with
        intuitive ease. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes
        to abide in his mind.  || 4 || 5 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  Attachment
        to Maya is burnt away by the Word of the Shabad. The mind and
        body are rejuvenated by the Love of the True Guru. The tree bears
        fruit at the Lord's Door, in love with the True Bani of
        the Guru's Word, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||   This mind is rejuvenated, with intuitive ease; loving the
        True Guru, it bears the fruit of truth.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        He Himself is near, and He Himself is far away. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, He is seen to be ever-present, close
        at hand. The plants have blossomed forth, giving a dense shade.
        The Gurmukh blossoms forth, with intuitive ease.  || 2 ||   Night
        and day, he sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, day
        and night. <br>

      <p> The True Guru drives out sin and doubt from within. Gazing upon
        the wonder of God's Creation, I am wonder-struck and amazed.
        The Gurmukh obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord, by His Grace.
        || 3 ||   The Creator Himself enjoys all delights. Whatever He
        does, surely comes to pass. He is the Great Giver; He has no greed
        at all. O Nanak, living the Word of the Shabad, the mortal meets
        with God.  || 4 || 6 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  By perfect destiny,
        one acts in truth. Remembering the One Lord, one does not have
        to enter the cycle of reincarnation. Fruitful is the coming into
        the world, and the life of one who remains intuitively absorbed
        in the True Name.  || 1 ||   The Gurmukh acts, lovingly attuned
        to the Lord. Be dedicated to the Lord's Name, and eradicate
        self-conceit from within.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   True is the speech
        of that humble being; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        it is spread throughout the world. Throughout the four ages, his
        fame and glory spread. Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        the Lord's humble servant is recognized and renowned. 
        || 2 ||   Some remain lovingly attuned to the True Word of the
        Shabad. True are those humble beings who love the True Lord. They
        meditate on the True Lord, and behold Him near at hand, ever-present.
        They are the dust of the lotus feet of the humble Saints.  ||
        3 ||   There is only One Creator Lord; there is no other at all.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, comes Union with
        the Lord. Whoever serves the True Lord finds joy. O Nanak, he
        is intuitively absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  ||
        4 || 7 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  The Lord's humble servant
        worships Him, and beholds Him ever-present, near at hand. He is
        the dust of the lotus feet of the humble Saints. Those who remain
        lovingly attuned to the Lord forever are blessed with understanding
        by the Perfect True Guru.  || 1 ||   How rare are those who become
        the slave of the Lord's slaves. They attain the supreme
        status.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So serve the One Lord, and no other.
        Serving Him, eternal peace is obtained. He does not die; He does
        not come and go in reincarnation. Why should I serve any other
        than Him, O my mother?  || 2 ||   True are those humble beings
        who realize the True Lord. Conquering their self-conceit, they
        merge intuitively into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Gurmukhs
        gather in the Naam. Their minds are immaculate, and their reputations
        are immaculate.  || 3 ||   Know the Lord, who gave you spiritual
        wisdom, and realize the One God, through the True Word of the
        Shabad. When the mortal tastes the sublime essence of the Lord,
        he becomes pure and holy. O Nanak, those who are imbued with the
        Naam - their reputations are true.  || 4 || 8 ||   BASANT,
        THIRD MEHL:  Those who are imbued with the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord - their generations are redeemed and saved. True
        is their speech; they love the Naam. Why have the wandering self-willed
        manmukhs even come into the world? Forgetting the Naam, the mortals
        waste their lives away.  || 1 ||   One who dies while yet alive,
        truly dies, and embellishes his death. Through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, he enshrines the True Lord within his heart.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Truth is the food of the Gurmukh; his body
        is sanctified and pure. His mind is immaculate; he is forever
        the ocean of virtue. He is not forced to come and go in the cycle
        of birth and death. By Guru's Grace, he merges in the True
        Lord.  || 2 ||   Serving the True Lord, one realizes Truth. <br>

      <p> Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he goes to the Lord's
        Court with his banners flying proudly. In the Court of the True
        Lord, he obtains true glory. He comes to dwell in the home of
        his own inner being.  || 3 ||   He cannot be fooled; He is the
        Truest of the True. All others are deluded; in duality, they lose
        their honor. So serve the True Lord, through the True Bani of
        His Word. O Nanak, through the Naam, merge in the True Lord. 
        || 4 || 9 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  Without the grace of good
        karma, all are deluded by doubt. In attachment to Maya, they suffer
        in terrible pain. The blind, self-willed manmukhs find no place
        of rest. They are like maggots in manure, rotting away in manure.
        || 1 ||   That humble being who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command is accepted. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        he is blessed with the insignia and the banner of the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who have such pre-ordained
        destiny are imbued with the Naam. The Name of the Lord is forever
        pleasing to their minds. Through the Bani, the Word of the True
        Guru, eternal peace is found. Through it, one's light merges
        into the Light.  || 2 ||   Only the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        can save the world. By Guru's Grace, one comes to love
        the Naam. Without the Naam, no one obtains liberation. Through
        the Perfect Guru, the Naam is obtained.  || 3 ||   He alone understands,
        whom the Lord Himself causes to understand. Serving the True Guru,
        the Naam is implanted within. Those humble beings who know the
        One Lord are approved and accepted. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam,
        they go to the Lord's Court with His banner and insignia.
        || 4 || 10 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  Granting His Grace, the
        Lord leads the mortal to meet the True Guru. The Lord Himself
        comes to abide in his mind. His intellect becomes steady and stable,
        and his mind is strengthened forever. He sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, the Ocean of Virtue.  || 1 ||   Those who forget
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord - those mortals die eating
        poison. Their lives are wasted uselessly, and they continue coming
        and going in reincarnation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They wear all
        sorts of religious robes, but their minds are not at peace. In
        great egotism, they lose their honor. But those who realize the
        Word of the Shabad, are blessed by great good fortune. They bring
        their distractible minds back home.  || 2 ||   Within the home
        of the inner self is the inaccessible and infinite substance.
        Those who find it, by following the Guru's Teachings, contemplate
        the Shabad. Those who obtain the nine treasures of the Naam within
        the home of their own inner being, are forever dyed in the color
        of the Lord's Love; they are absorbed in the Truth.  ||
        3 ||   God Himself does everything; no one can do anything at
        all by himself. When God so wills, He merges the mortal into Himself.
        All are near Him; no one is far away from Him. O Nanak, the Naam
        is permeating and pervading everywhere.  || 4 || 11 ||   BASANT,
        THIRD MEHL:  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, remember
        the Lord with love, and you shall remain satisfied by the sublime
        essence of the Lord's Name. The sins of millions upon millions
        of lifetimes shall be burnt away. Remaining dead while yet alive,
        you shall be absorbed in the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   The
        Dear Lord Himself knows His own bountiful blessings. This mind
        blossoms forth in the Guru's Shabad, chanting the Name
        of the Lord, the Giver of virtue.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   No one
        is liberated by wandering around in saffron-colored robes. Tranquility
        is not found by strict self-discipline. But by following the Guru's
        Teachings, one is blessed to receive the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord. By great good fortune, one finds the Lord.  || 2 || <br>

      <p> In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, glorious greatness comes through
        the Lord's Name. Through the Perfect Guru, it is obtained.
        Those who are imbued with the Naam find everlasting peace. But
        without the Naam, mortals burn in egotism.  || 3 ||   By great
        good furtune, some contemplate the Lord's Name. Through
        the Lord's Name, all sorrows are eradicated. He dwells
        within the heart, and pervades the external universe as well.
        O Nanak, the Creator Lord knows all.  || 4 || 12 ||   BASANT,
        THIRD MEHL,  IK-TUKAS:  I am just a worm, created by You, O Lord.
        If you bless me, then I chant Your Primal Mantra.  || 1 ||   I
        chant and reflect on His Glorious Virtues, O my mother. Meditating
        on the Lord, I fall at the Lord's Feet.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   By Guru's Grace, I am addicted to the favor of the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. Why waste your life in hatred, vengeance
        and conflict?  || 2 ||   When the Guru granted His Grace, my egotism
        was eradicated, and then, I obtained the Lord's Name with
        intuitive ease.  || 3 ||   The most lofty and exalted occupation
        is to contemplate the Word of the Shabad. Nanak chants the True
        Name.  || 4 || 1 || 13 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  The season of
        spring has come, and all the plants have blossomed forth. This
        mind blossoms forth, in association with the True Guru.  || 1
        ||   So meditate on the True Lord, O my foolish mind. Only then
        shall you find peace, O my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This mind
        blossoms forth, and I am in ecstasy. I am blessed with the Ambrosial
        Fruit of the Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe.  || 2
        ||   Everyone speaks and says that the Lord is the One and Only.
        By understanding the Hukam of His Command, we come to know the
        One Lord.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, no one can describe the Lord
        by speaking through ego. All speech and insight comes from our
        Lord and Master.  || 4 || 2 || 14 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  All
        the ages were created by You, O Lord. Meeting with the True Guru,
        one's intellect is awakened.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, please
        blend me with Yourself; let me merge in the True Name, through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When
        the mind is in spring, all people are rejuvenated. Blossoming
        forth and flowering through the Lord's Name, peace is obtained.
        || 2 ||   Contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        one is in spring forever, with the Lord's Name enshrined
        in the heart.  || 3 ||   When the mind is in spring, the body
        and mind are rejuvenated. O Nanak, this body is the tree which
        bears the fruit of the Lord's Name.  || 4 || 3 || 15 ||
        BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  They alone are in the spring season, who
        sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. They come to worship the
        Lord with devotion, through their perfect destiny.  || 1 ||  
        This mind is not even touched by spring. This mind is burnt by
        duality and double-mindedness.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This mind
        is entangled in worldly affairs, creating more and more karma.
        Enchanted by Maya, it cries out in suffering forever.  || 2 ||
        This mind is released, only when it meets with the True Guru.
        Then, it does not suffer beatings by the Messenger of Death. 
        || 3 ||   This mind is released, when the Guru emancipates it.
        O Nanak, attachment to Maya is burnt away through the Word of
        the Shabad.  || 4 || 4 || 16 ||   BASANT,  THIRD MEHL:  Spring
        has come, and all the plants are flowering. <br>

      <p> These beings and creatures blossom forth when they focus their
        consciousness on the Lord.  || 1 ||   In this way, this mind is
        rejuvenated. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, day and
        night, egotism is removed and washed away from the Gurmukhs. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The True Guru speaks the Bani of the Word,
        and the Shabad, the Word of God. This world blossoms forth in
        its greenery, through the love of the True Guru.  || 2 ||   The
        mortal blossoms forth in flower and fruit, when the Lord Himself
        so wills. He is attached to the Lord, the Primal Root of all,
        when he finds the True Guru.  || 3 ||   The Lord Himself is the
        season of spring; the whole world is His Garden. O Nanak, this
        most unique devotional worship comes only by perfect destiny.

        with Him, O my mother.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One Lord is deep
        within each and every heart. Meeting with the Guru, the One Lord
        becomes manifest, radiating forth.  || 2 ||  The One and Only
        Lord is present and prevailing everywhere. The greedy, faithless
        cynic thinks that God is far away.  || 3 ||   The One and Only

        Day and night, the two calls are sent out. O mortal, meditate
        in remembrance on the Lord, who protects you forever, and saves
        you in the end.  || 1 ||   Concentrate forever on the Lord, Har,
        Har, O my mind. God the Destroyer of all depression and suffering
        is found, through the Guru's Teachings, singing the Glorious
        Praises of God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukhs

      <p> They are destroyed by Death's demons, and they must go

        are taken away.  || 3 ||   The Lord showers His Mercy on His humble

        the Lord of the forest.  || 4 || 2 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The Lord's Name is a jewel, hidden
        in a chamber of the palace of the body-fortress. When one meets
        the True Guru, then he searches and finds it, and his light merges
        with the Divine Light.  || 1 ||   O Lord, lead me to meet with
        the Holy Person, the Guru. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His
        Darshan, all my sins are erased, and I obtain the supreme, sublime,
        sanctified status.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The five thieves join
        together and plunder the body-village, stealing the wealth of
        the Lord's Name. But through the Guru's Teachings,
        they are traced and caught, and this wealth is recovered intact.
        || 2 ||   Practicing hypocrisy and superstition, people have
        grown weary of the effort, but still, deep within their hearts,
        they yearn for Maya, Maya. By the Grace of the Holy Person, I
        have met with the Lord, the Primal Being, and the darkness of
        ignorance is dispelled.  || 3 ||   The Lord, the Lord of the Earth,
        the Lord of the Universe, in His Mercy, leads me to meet the Holy
        Person, the Guru. O Nanak, peace then comes to abide deep within
        my mind, and I constantly sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
        within my heart.  || 4 || 1 || 3 ||   BASANT,  FOURTH MEHL,  HINDOL:
        You are the Great Supreme Being, the Vast and Inaccessible Lord
        of the World; I am a mere insect, a worm created by You. O Lord,
        Merciful to the meek, please grant Your Grace; O God, I long for
        the feet of the Guru, the True Guru.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord of
        the Universe, please be merciful and unite me with the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation. I was overflowing with the filthy residues
        of my sinful mistakes of countless past lives. But joining the
        Sangat, God made me pure again.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your humble
        servant, whether of high class or low class, O Lord - by
        meditating on You, the sinner becomes pure. The Lord exalts and
        elevates him above the whole world, and the Lord God blesses him
        with the Lord's Glory.  || 2 ||   Anyone who meditates
        on God, whether of high class or low class, will have all of his
        hopes and desires fulfilled. Those humble servants of the Lord
        who enshrine the Lord within their hearts, are blessed, and are
        made great and totally perfect.  || 3 ||   I am so low, I am an
        utterly heavy lump of clay. Please shower Your Mercy on me, Lord,
        and unite me with Yourself. The Lord, in His Mercy, has led servant
        Nanak to find the Guru; I was a sinner, and now I have become
        immaculate and pure.  ||  || 4 || 2 || 4 ||   BASANT HINDOL, 
        FOURTH MEHL:  My mind cannot survive, even for an instant, without
        the Lord. I drink in continually the sublime essence of the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har. It is like a baby, who joyfully sucks at
        his mother's breast; when the breast is withdrawn, he weeps
        and cries.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord of the Universe, my mind and
        body are pierced through by the Name of the Lord. </font><br>
