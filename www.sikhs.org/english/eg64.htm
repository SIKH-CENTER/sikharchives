      <p> DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He does not let His devotees see the
        difficult times; this is His innate nature. Giving His hand, He
        protects His devotee; with each and every breath, He cherishes
        him.  || 1 ||   My consciousness remains attached to God. In the
        beginning, and in the end, God is always my helper and companion;
        blessed is my friend.  ||  Pause  ||   My mind is delighted, gazing
        upon the marvellous, glorious greatness of the Lord and Master.
        Remembering, remembering the Lord in meditation, Nanak is in ecstasy;
        God, in His perfection, has protected and preserved his honor.
        || 2 || 15 || 46 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who forgets
        the Lord of life, the Great Giver  -  know that he is most
        unfortunate. One whose mind is in love with the Lord's lotus
        feet, obtains the pool of ambrosial nectar.  || 1 ||   Your humble
        servant awakes in the Love of the Lord's Name. All laziness
        has departed from his body, and his mind is attached to the Beloved
        Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   Wherever I look, the Lord is there; He
        is the string, upon which all hearts are strung. Drinking in the
        water of the Naam, servant Nanak has renounced all other loves.
        || 2 || 16 || 47 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  All the affairs
        of the Lord's humble servant are perfectly resolved. In the
        utterly poisonous Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord preserves and
        protects his honor.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Remembering, remembering
        God, his Lord and Master in meditation, the Messenger of Death
        does not approach him. Liberation and heaven are found in the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; his humble servant finds
        the home of the Lord.  || 1 ||   The Lord's lotus feet are
        the treasure of His humble servant; in them, he finds millions
        of pleasures and comforts. He remembers the Lord God in meditation,
        day and night; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to him.  || 2 || 17
        || 48 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I beg for one gift only
        from the Lord. May all my desires be fulfilled, meditating on,
        and remembering Your Name, O Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   May Your
        feet abide within my heart, and may I find the Society of the
        Saints. May my mind not be afflicted by the fire of sorrow; may
        I sing Your Glorious Praises, twenty-four hours a day.  || 1 ||
        May I serve the Lord in my childhood and youth, and meditate
        on God in my middle and old age. O Nanak, one who is imbued with
        the Love of the Transcendent Lord, is not reincarnated again to
        die.  || 2 || 18 || 49 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I beg only
        from the Lord for all things. I would hesitate to beg from other
        people. Remembering God in meditation, liberation is obtained.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have studied with the silent sages, and
        carefully read the Simritees, the Puraanas and the Vedas; they
        all proclaim that, by serving the Lord, the ocean of mercy, Truth
        is obtained, and both this world and the next are embellished.
        || 1 ||   All other rituals and customs are useless, without
        remembering the Lord in meditation. O Nanak, the fear of birth
        and death has been removed; meeting the Holy Saint, sorrow is
        dispelled.  || 2 || 19 || 50 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Desire
        is quenched, through the Lord's Name. </p>

      <p> Great peace and contentment come through the Guru's Word,
        and one's meditation is perfectly focused upon God.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Please shower Your Mercy upon me, and permit me
        to ignore the great enticements of Maya, O Lord, Merciful to the
        meek. Give me Your Name  -  chanting it, I live; please bring
        the efforts of Your slave to fruition.  || 1 ||   All desires,
        power, pleasure, joy and lasting bliss, are found by chanting
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and singing the Kirtan of His
        Praises. That humble servant of the Lord, who has such karma pre-ordained
        by the Creator Lord, O Nanak  -  his efforts are brought to
        perfect fruition.  || 2 || 20 || 51 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Supreme Lord God takes care of His humble servant. The slanderers
        are not allowed to stay; they are pulled out by their roots, like
        useless weeds.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Wherever I look, there I
        see my Lord and Master; no one can harm me. Whoever shows disrespect
        to the Lord's humble servant, is instantly reduced to ashes.
        || 1 ||   The Creator Lord has become my protector; He has no
        end or limitation. O Nanak, God has protected and saved His slaves;
        He has driven out and destroyed the slanderers.  || 2 || 21 ||

        DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL,  NINTH HOUSE,  PARTAAL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> O Lord, I seek the Sanctuary of Your feet; Lord of the Universe,
        Destroyer of pain, please bless Your slave with Your Name. Be
        Merciful, God, and bless me with Your Glance of Grace; take my
        arm and save me  -  pull me up out of this pit!  || Pause 
        ||   He is blinded by sexual desire and anger, bound by Maya;
        his body and clothes are filled with countless sins. Without God,
        there is no other protector; help me to chant Your Name, Almighty
        Warrior, Sheltering Lord.  || 1 ||   Redeemer of sinners, Saving
        Grace of all beings and creatures, even those who recite the Vedas
        have not found Your limit. God is the ocean of virtue and peace,
        the source of jewels; Nanak sings the Praises of the Lover of
        His devotees.  || 2 || 1 || 53 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Peace in this world, peace in the next world and peace forever,
        remembering Him in meditation. Chant forever the Name of the Lord
        of the Universe. The sins of past lives are erased, by joining
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; new life is infused
        into the dead.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In power, youth and Maya,
        the Lord is forgotten; this is the greatest tragedy  -  so
        say the spiritual sages. Hope and desire to sing the Kirtan of
        the Lord's Praises  -  this is the treasure of the most
        fortunate devotees.  || 1 ||   O Lord of Sanctuary, all-powerful,
        imperceptible and unfathomable  -  Your Name is the Purifier
        of sinners. The Inner-knower, the Lord and Master of Nanak is
        totally pervading and permeating everywhere; He is my Lord and
        Master.  || 2 || 2 || 54 || </p>

        DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL,  TWELFTH HOUSE:

      <p> I bow in reverence to the Lord, I bow in reverence. I sing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord, my King.  ||  Pause  ||   By great

      </p>
      <p> Millions of sins are erased by serving the Lord.  || 1 ||   One
        whose mind is imbued with the Lord's lotus feet is not afflicted
        by the fire of sorrow.  || 2 ||   He crosses over the world-ocean
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. He chants the Name
        of the Fearless Lord, and is imbued with the Lord's Love.
        || 3 ||   One who does not steal the wealth of others, who does
        not commit evil deeds or sinful acts  -  the Messenger of Death
        does not even approach him.  || 4 ||   God Himself quenches the
        fires of desire. O Nanak, in God's Sanctuary, one is saved.
        || 5 || 1 || 55 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I am satisfied
        and satiated, eating the food of Truth. With my mind, body and
        tongue, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        Life, spiritual life, is in the Lord. Spiritual life consists
        of chanting the Lord's Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is dressed in robes of all
        sorts, if he sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Glorious Praises,
        day and night.  || 2 ||   He rides upon elephants, chariots and
        horses, if he sees the Lord's Path within his own heart.
        || 3 ||   Meditating on the Lord's Feet, deep within his
        mind and body, slave Nanak has found the Lord, the treasure of
        peace.  || 4 || 2 || 56 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Guru's
        feet emancipate the soul. They carry it across the world-ocean
        in an instant.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Some love rituals, and some
        bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. The Lord's slaves
        meditate on His Name.  || 1 ||   The Lord Master is the Breaker
        of bonds. Servant Nanak meditates in remembrance on the Lord,
        the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.  || 2 || 3 || 57 ||
        DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The lifestyle of Your slave is so
        pure, that nothing can break his love for You.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   He is more dear to me than my soul, my breath of life, my
        mind and my wealth. The Lord is the Giver, the Restrainer of the
        ego.  || 1 ||   I am in love with the Lord's lotus feet.
        This alone is Nanak's prayer.  || 2 || 4 || 58 || </p>

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> DHANAASAREE,  NINTH MEHL:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Why do you go looking for Him in the forest? Although he is unattached,
        he dwells everywhere. He is always with you as your companion.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Like the fragrance which remains in the
        flower, and like the reflection in the mirror, the Lord dwells
        deep within; search for Him within your own heart, O Siblings
        of Destiny.  || 1 ||   Outside and inside, know that there is
        only the One Lord; the Guru has imparted this wisdom to me. O
        servant Nanak, without knowing one's own self, the moss of
        doubt is not removed.  || 2 || 1 ||   DHANAASAREE,  NINTH MEHL:
        O Holy people, this world is deluded by doubt. It has forsaken
        the meditative remembrance of the Lord's Name, and sold itself
        out to Maya.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> Mother, father, siblings, children and spouse  -  he is entangled
        in their love. In the pride of youth, wealth and glory, day and
        night, he remains intoxicated.  || 1 ||   God is merciful to the
        meek, and forever the Destroyer of pain, but the mortal does not
        center his mind on Him. O servant Nanak, among millions, only
        a rare few, as Gurmukh, realize God.  || 2 || 2 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        NINTH MEHL:  That Yogi does not know the way. Understand that
        his heart is filled with greed, emotional attachment, Maya and
        egotism.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who does not slander or praise
        others, who looks upon gold and iron alike, who is free from pleasure
        and pain  -  he alone is called a true Yogi.  || 1 ||   The
        restless mind wanders in the ten directions  -  it needs to
        be pacified and restrained. Says Nanak, whoever knows this technique
        is judged to be liberated.  || 2 || 3 ||   DHANAASAREE,  NINTH
        MEHL:  Now, what efforts should I make? How can I dispel the anxieties
        of my mind? How can I cross over the terrifying world-ocean? 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Obtaining this human incarnation, I have
        done no good deeds; this makes me very afraid! In thought, word
        and deed, I have not sung the Lord's Praises; this thought
        worries my mind.  || 1 ||   I listened to the Guru's Teachings,
        but spiritual wisdom did not well up within me; like a beast,
        I fill my belly. Says Nanak, O God, please confirm Your Law of
        Grace; for only then can I, the sinner, be saved.  || 2 || 4 ||

        DHANAASAREE,  FIRST MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE,  ASHTAPADEES:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The Guru is the ocean, filled with pearls. The Saints gather in
        the Ambrosial Nectar; they do not go far away from there. They
        taste the subtle essence of the Lord; they are loved by God. Within
        this pool, the swans find their Lord, the Lord of their souls.
        || 1 ||   What can the poor crane accomplish by bathing in the
        mud puddle? It sinks into the mire, and its filth is not washed
        away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   After careful deliberation, the thoughtful
        person takes a step. Forsaking duality, he becomes a devotee of
        the Formless Lord. He obtains the treasure of liberation, and
        enjoys the sublime essence of the Lord. His comings and goings
        end, and the Guru protects him.  || 2 ||   The swan do not leave
        this pool. In loving devotional worship, they merge in the Celestial
        Lord. The swans are in the pool, and the pool is in the swans.
        They speak the Unspoken Speech, and they honor and revere the
        Guru's Word.  || 3 ||   The Yogi, the Primal Lord, sits within
        the celestial sphere of deepest Samaadhi. He is not male, and
        He is not female; how can anyone describe Him? The three worlds
        continue to center their attention on His Light. The silent sages
        and the Yogic masters seek the Sanctuary of the True Lord.  ||
        4 ||   The Lord is the source of bliss, the support of the helpless.
        The Gurmukhs worship and contemplate the Celestial Lord. God is
        the Lover of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear. Subduing ego,
        one meets the Lord, and places his feet on the Path.  || 5 ||
        He makes many efforts, but still, the Messenger of Death tortures
        him. Destined only to die, he comes into the world. </p>

      <p> He wastes this precious human life through duality. He does not
        know his own self, and trapped by doubts, he cries out in pain.
        || 6 ||   Speak, read and hear of the One Lord. The Support of
        the earth shall bless you with courage, righteousness and protection.
        Chastity, purity and self-restraint are infused into the heart,
        when one centers his mind in the fourth state.  || 7 ||   They
        are immaculate and true, and filth does not stick to them. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, their doubt and fear depart.
        The form and personality of the Primal Lord are incomparably beautiful.
        Nanak begs for the Lord, the Embodiment of Truth.  || 8 || 1 ||
        DHANAASAREE,  FIRST MEHL:  That union with the Lord is acceptable,
        which is united in intuitive poise. Thereafter, one does not die,
        and does not come and go in reincarnation. The Lord's slave
        is in the Lord, and the Lord is in His slave. Wherever I look,
        I see none other than the Lord.  || 1 ||   The Gurmukhs worship
        the Lord, and find His celestial home. Without meeting the Guru,
        they die, and come and go in reincarnation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        So make Him your Guru, who implants the Truth within you, who
        leads you to speak the Unspoken Speech, and who merges you in
        the Word of the Shabad. God's people have no other work to
        do; they love the True Lord and Master, and they love the Truth.
        || 2 ||   The mind is in the body, and the True Lord is in the
        mind. Merging into the True Lord, one is absorbed into Truth.
        God's servant bows at His feet. Meeting the True Guru, one
        meets with the Lord.  || 3 ||   He Himself watches over us, and
        He Himself makes us see. He is not pleased by stubborn-mindedness,
        nor by various religious robes. He fashioned the body-vessels,
        and infused the Ambrosial Nectar into them; God's Mind is
        pleased only by loving devotional worship.  || 4 ||   Reading
        and studying, one becomes confused, and suffers punishment. By
        great cleverness, one is consigned to coming and going in reincarnation.
        One who chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and eats the food
        of the Fear of God becomes Gurmukh, the Lord's servant, and
        remains absorbed in the Lord.  || 5 ||   He worships stones, dwells
        at sacred shrines of pilgrimage and in the jungles, wanders, roams
        around and becomes a renunciate. But his mind is still filthy
        -  how can he become pure? One who meets the True Lord obtains
        honor.  || 6 ||   One who embodies good conduct and contemplative
        meditation, his mind abides in intuitive poise and contentment,
        since the beginning of time, and throughout the ages. In the twinkling
        of an eye, he saves millions. Have mercy on me, O my Beloved,
        and let me meet the Guru.  || 7 ||   Unto whom, O God, should
        I praise You? Without You, there is no other at all. As it pleases
        You, keep me under Your Will. Nanak, with intuitive poise and
        natural love, sings Your Glorious Praises.  || 8 || 2 || </p>

        Is there any such Saint, who would meet with me, take away my
        anxiety, and lead me to enshrine love for my Lord and Master.
        || 2 ||   I have read all the Vedas, and yet the sense of separation
        in my mind still has not been removed; the five thieves of my
        house are not quieted, even for an instant. Is there any devotee,
        who is unattached to Maya, who may irrigate my mind with the Ambrosial
        Naam, the Name of the One Lord?  || 3 ||   In spite of the many
        places of pilgrimage for people to bathe in, their minds are still
        stained by their stubborn ego; the Lord Master is not pleased
        by this at all. When will I find the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy? There, I shall be always in the ecstasy of the Lord,
        Har, Har, and my mind shall take its cleansing bath in the healing
        ointment of spiritual wisdom.  || 4 ||   I have followed the four
        stages of life, but my mind is not satisfied; I wash my body,
        but it is totally lacking in understanding. If only I could meet
        some devotee of the Supreme Lord God, imbued with the Lord's
        Love, who could eradicate the filthy evil-mindedness from my mind.
        || 5 ||   One who is attached to religious rituals, does not
        love the Lord, even for an instant; he is filled with pride, and
        he is of no account. One who meets with the rewarding personality
        of the Guru, continually sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
        By Guru's Grace, such a rare one beholds the Lord with his
        eyes.  || 6 ||   One who acts through stubbornness is of no account
        at all; like a crane, he pretends to meditate, but he is still
        stuck in Maya. Is there any such Giver of peace, who can recite
        to me the sermon of God? Meeting him, I would be emancipated.
        || 7 ||   When the Lord, my King, is totally pleased with me,
        He will break the bonds of Maya for me; my mind is imbued with
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. I am in ecstasy, forever and
        ever, meeting the Fearless Lord, the Lord of the Universe. Falling
        at the Lord's Feet, Nanak has found peace.  || 8 ||   My
        Yatra, my life pilgrimage, has become fruitful, fruitful, fruitful.
        My comings and goings have ended, since I met the Holy Saint.

        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Why should I bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage? The Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, is the sacred shrine of pilgrimage. My sacred
        shrine of pilgrimage is spiritual wisdom within, and contemplation
        on the Word of the Shabad. The spiritual wisdom given by the Guru
        is the True sacred shrine of pilgrimage, where the ten festivals
        are always observed. I constantly beg for the Name of the Lord;
        grant it to me, O God, Sustainer of the world. The world is sick,
        and the Naam is the medicine to cure it; without the True Lord,
        filth sticks to it. The Guru's Word is immaculate and pure;
        it radiates a steady Light. Constantly bathe in such a true shrine
        of pilgrimage.  || 1 ||   Filth does not stick to the true ones;
        what filth do they have to wash off? If one strings a garland
        of virtues for oneself, what is there to cry for? One who conquers
        his own self through contemplation is saved, and saves others
        as well; he does not come to be born again. The supreme meditator
        is Himself the philosopher's stone, which transforms lead
        into gold. The true man is pleasing to the True Lord. He is in
        ecstasy, truly happy, night and day; his sorrows and sins are
        taken away. He finds the True Name, and beholds the Guru; with
        the True Name in his mind, no filth sticks to him.  || 2 || </p>

      <p> O friend, association with the Holy is the perfect cleansing bath.
        The singer who sings the Lord's Praises is adorned with the
        Word of the Shabad. Worship the True Lord, and believe in the
        True Guru; this brings the merit of making donations to charity,
        kindness and compassion. The soul-bride who loves to be with her
        Husband Lord bathes at the Triveni, the sacred place where the
        Ganges, Jamuna and Saraswaati Rivers converge, the Truest of the
        True. Worship and adore the One Creator, the True Lord, who constantly
        gives, whose gifts continually increase. Salvation is attained
        by associating with the Society of the Saints, O friend; granting
        His Grace, God unites us in His Union.  || 3 ||   Everyone speaks
        and talks; how great should I say He is? I am foolish, lowly and
        ignorant; it is only through the Guru's Teachings that I
        understand. True are the Teachings of the Guru. His Words are
        Ambrosial Nectar; my mind is pleased and appeased by them. Loaded
        down with corruption and sin, people depart, and then come back
        again; the True Shabad is found through my Guru. There is no end
        to the treasure of devotion; the Lord is pervading everywhere.
        Nanak utters this true prayer; one who purifies his mind is True.
        || 4 || 1 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIRST MEHL:  I live by Your Name;
        my mind is in ecstasy, Lord. True is the Name of the True Lord.
        Glorious are the Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Infinite
        is the spiritual wisdom imparted by the Guru. The Creator Lord
        who created, shall also destroy. The call of death is sent out
        by the Lord's Command; no one can challenge it. He Himself
        creates, and watches; His written command is above each and every
        head. He Himself imparts understanding and awareness. O Nanak,
        the Lord Master is inaccessible and unfathomable; I live by His
        True Name.  || 1 ||   No one can compare to You, Lord; all come
        and go. By Your Command, the account is settled, and doubt is
        dispelled. The Guru dispels doubt, and makes us speak the Unspoken
        Speech; the true ones are absorbed into Truth. He Himself creates,
        and He Himself destroys; I accept the Command of the Commander
        Lord. True greatness comes from the Guru; You alone are the mind's
        companion in the end. O Nanak, there is no other than the Lord
        and Master; greatness comes from Your Name.  || 2 ||   You are
        the True Creator Lord, the unknowable Maker. There is only the
        One Lord and Master, but there are two paths, by which conflict
        increases. All follow these two paths, by the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command; the world is born, only to die. Without the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, the mortal has no friend at all; he carries
        loads of sin on his head. By the Hukam of the Lord's Command,
        he comes, but he does not understand this Hukam; the Lord's
        Hukam is the Embellisher. O Nanak, through the Shabad, the Word
        of the Lord and Master, the True Creator Lord is realized.  ||
        3 ||   Your devotees look beautiful in Your Court, embellished
        with the Shabad. They chant the Ambrosial Word of His Bani, savoring
        it with their tongues. Savoring it with their tongues, they thirst
        for the Naam; they are a sacrifice to the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. Touching the philosopher's stone, they become the
        philosopher's stone, which transforms lead into gold; O Lord,
        they become pleasing to your mind. They attain the immortal status
        and eradicate their self-conceit; how rare is that person, who
        contemplates spiritual wisdom. O Nanak, the devotees look beautiful
        in the Court of the True Lord; they are dealers in the Truth.
        || 4 ||   I am hungry and thirsty for wealth; how will I be able
        to go to the Lord's Court? </p>

      </p>
      <p> I shall go and ask the True Guru, and meditate on the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord. I meditate on the True Name, chant the True
        Name, and as Gurmukh, I realize the True Name. Night and day,
        I chant the Name of the merciful, immaculate Lord, the Master
        of the poor. The Primal Lord has ordained the tasks to be done;
        self-conceit is overcome, and the mind is subdued. O Nanak, the
        Naam is the sweetest essence; through the Naam, thirst and desire
        are stilled.  || 5 || 2 ||   DHANAASAREE,  CHHANT,  FIRST MEHL:
        Your Husband Lord is with you, O deluded soul-bride, but you
        do are not aware of Him. Your destiny is written on your forehead,
        according to your past actions. This inscription of past deeds
        cannot be erased; what do I know about what will happen? You have
        not adopted a virtuous lifestyle, and you are not attuned to the
        Lord's Love; you sit there, crying over your past misdeeds.Wealth
        and youth are like the shade of the bitter swallow-wort plant;
        you are growing old, and your days are coming to their end. O
        Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you shall end up
        as a discarded, divorced bride; your own falsehood shall separate
        you from the Lord.  || 1 ||   You have drowned, and your house
        is ruined; walk in the Way of the Guru's Will. Meditate on
        the True Name, and you shall find peace in the Mansion of the
        Lord's Presence. Meditate on the Lord's Name, and you
        shall find peace; your stay in this world shall last only four
        days. Sit in the home of your own being, and you shall find Truth;
        night and day, be with your Beloved. Without loving devotion,
        you cannot dwell in your own home  -  listen, everyone! O Nanak,
        she is happy, and she obtains her Husband Lord, if she is attuned
        to the True Name.  || 2 ||   If the soul-bride is pleasing to
        her Husband Lord, then the Husband Lord will love His bride. Imbued
        with the love of her Beloved, she contemplates the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad. She contemplates the Guru's Shabads,
        and her Husband Lord loves her; in deep humility, she worships
        Him in loving devotion. She burns away her emotional attachment
        to Maya, and in love, she loves her Beloved. She is imbued and
        drenched with the Love of the True Lord; she has become beautiful,
        by conquering her mind. O Nanak, the happy soul-bride abides in
        Truth; she loves to love her Husband Lord.  || 3 ||   The soul-bride
        looks so beautiful in the home of her Husband Lord, if she is
        pleasing to Him. It is of no use at all to speak false words.
        If she speaks false, it is of no use to her, and she does not
        see her Husband Lord with her eyes. Worthless, forgotten and abandoned
        by her Husband Lord, she passes her life-night without her Lord
        and Master. Such a wife does not believe in the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad; she is caught in the net of the world, and does not obtain
        the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. O Nanak, if she understands
        her own self, then, as Gurmukh, she merges in celestial peace.
        || 4 ||   Blessed is that soul-bride, who knows her Husband Lord.
        Without the Naam, she is false, and her actions are false as well.
        Devotional worship of the Lord is beautiful; the True Lord loves
        it. So immerse yourself in loving devotional worship of God. My
        Husband Lord is playful and innocent; imbued with His Love, I
        enjoy Him. She blossoms forth through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad; she ravishes her Husband Lord, and obtains the most noble
        reward. O Nanak, in Truth, she obtains glory; in her Husband's
        home, the soul-bride looks beautiful.  || 5 || 3 || </p>

        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> When the Dear Lord grants His Grace, one meditates on the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Meeting the True Guru, through loving faith
        and devotion, one intuitively sings the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord. Singing His Glorious Praises continually, night and day,
        one blossoms forth, when it is pleasing to the True Lord. Egotism,
        self-conceit and Maya are forsaken, and he is intuitively absorbed
        into the Naam. The Creator Himself acts; when He gives, then we
        receive. When the Dear Lord grants His Grace, we meditate on the
        Naam.  || 1 ||   Deep within, I feel true love for the Perfect
        True Guru. I serve Him day and night; I never forget Him. I never
        forget Him; I remember Him night and day. When I chant the Naam,
        then I live. With my ears, I hear about Him, and my mind is satisfied.
        As Gurmukh, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. If He bestows His
        Glance of Grace, then I shall meet the True Guru; my discriminating
        intellect would contemplate Him, night and day. Deep within, I
        feel true love for the Perfect True Guru.  || 2 ||   By great
        good fortune, one joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation;
        then, one comes to savor the subtle essence of the Lord. Night
        and day, he remains lovingly focused on the Lord; he merges in
        celestial peace. Merging in celestial peace, he becomes pleasing
        to the Lord's Mind; he remains forever unattached and untouched.
        He receives honor in this world and the next, lovingly focused
        on the Lord's Name. He is liberated from both pleasure and
        pain; he is pleased by whatever God does. By great good fortune,
        one joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and then, one
        comes to savor the subtle essence of the Lord.  || 3 ||   In the
        love of duality, there is pain and suffering; the Messenger of
        Death eyes the self-willed manmukhs. They cry and howl, day and
        night, caught by the pain of Maya. Caught by the pain of Maya,
        provoked by his ego, he passes his life crying out, &quot;Mine,
        mine!&quot;. He does not remember God, the Giver, and in the end,
        he departs regretting and repenting. Without the Name, nothing
        shall go along with him; not his children, spouse or the enticements
        of Maya. In the love of duality, there is pain and suffering;
        the Messenger of Death eyes the self-willed manmukhs.  || 4 ||
        Granting His Grace, the Lord has merged me with Himself; I have
        found the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. I remain standing
        with my palms pressed together; I have become pleasing to God's
        Mind. When one is pleasing to God's Mind, then he merges
        in the Hukam of the Lord's Command; surrendering to His Hukam,
        he finds peace. Night and day, he chants the Lord's Name,
        day and night; intuitively, naturally, he meditates on the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Through the Naam, the glorious greatness
        of the Naam is obtained; the Naam is pleasing to Nanak's
        mind. Granting His Grace, the Lord has merged me with Himself;
        I have found the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.  || 5 ||

      <p> The True Guru is merciful to the meek; in His Presence, the Lord's
        Praises are sung. The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is chanted in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Vibrating, and worshipping
        the One Lord in the Company of the Holy, the pains of birth and
        death are removed. Those who have such karma pre-ordained, study
        and learn the Truth; the noose of Death is removed from their
        necks. Their fears and doubts are dispelled, the knot of death
        is untied, and they never have to walk on Death's path. Prays
        Nanak, shower me with Your Mercy, Lord; let me sing Your Glorious
        Praises forever.  || 1 ||   The Name of the One, Immaculate Lord
        is the Support of the unsupported. You are the Giver, the Great
        Giver, the Dispeller of all sorrow. O Destroyer of pain, Creator
        Lord, Master of peace and bliss, I have come seeking the Sanctuary
        of the Holy; please, help me to cross over the terrifying and
        difficult world-ocean in an instant. I saw the Lord pervading
        and permeating everywhere, when the healing ointment of the Guru's
        wisdom was applied to my eyes. Prays Nanak, remember Him forever
        in meditation, the Destroyer of all sorrow and fear.  || 2 ||
        He Himself has attached me to the hem of His robe; He has showered
        me with His Mercy. I am worthless, lowly and helpless; God is
        unfathomable and infinite. My Lord and Master is always merciful,
        kind and compassionate; He uplifts and establishes the lowly.
        All beings and creatures are under Your power; You take care of
        all. He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer;
        He Himself is the Contemplator of all. Prays Nanak, singing Your
        Glorious Praises, I live, chanting the Chant of the Lord, the
        Lord of the world-forest.  || 3 ||   The Blessed Vision of Your
        Darshan is incomparable; Your Name is utterly priceless. You dwell
        on the tongues of the Saints, by Your own pleasure; they are intoxicated
        with Your sublime essence, O Lord. Those who are attached to Your
        feet are very blessed; night and day, they remain always awake
        and aware. Forever and ever, meditate in remembrance on the Lord
        and Master; with each and every breath, speak His Glorious Praises.
        Prays Nanak, let me become the dust of the feet of the Saints.
        God's Name is invaluable.  || 4 || 1 || </p>

        Day by day, hour by hour, life runs its course, and the body

        fool. If Kabeer were to leave his body at Benares, and so liberate
        himself, what obligation would he have to the Lord?  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Says Kabeer, listen, O people  -  do not be deluded

        land of Maghar, if the Lord is within one's heart?  || 2
        || 3 ||   Mortals may go to the Realm of Indra, or the Realm of
        Shiva, but because of their hypocrisy and false prayers, they
        must leave again.  || 1 ||   What should I ask for? Nothing lasts
        forever. Enshrine the Lord's Name within your mind.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Fame and glory, power, wealth and glorious greatness
        -  none of these will go with you or help you in the end.
        || 2 ||   Children, spouse, wealth and Maya  -  who has ever
        obtained peace from these?  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, nothing else
        is of any use. Within my mind is the wealth of the Lord's
        Name.  || 4 || 4 ||   Remember the Lord, remember the Lord, remember
        the Lord in meditation, O Siblings of Destiny. Without remembering
        the Lord's Name in meditation, a great many are drowned.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your spouse, children, body, house and possessions
        -  you think these will give you peace. But none of these
        shall be yours, when the time of death comes.  || 1 ||   Ajaamal,
        the elephant, and the prostitute committed many sins, but still,
        they crossed over the world-ocean, by chanting the Lord's
