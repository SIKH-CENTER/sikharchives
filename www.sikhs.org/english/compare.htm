            <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Critique of 
              the Above Translations: <br>
              <br>
              </font></b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In review of Bhai Gopal 
                Singh's translation, what sticks out most are the forced rhymes, achieved 
                by breaking up sutras and sentence structure, and the frequently inserted 
                parenthetical phrases. These create unavoidable distractions for the 
                reader. Moreover, his use of word such as 'howso' and 'forsooth', words 
                not in common usage, further detract from the impact of the rendering. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Manmohan Singh's 
            translation is perhaps even more obtuse to the modern reader. He uses 
            words such as 'lacs' (meaning tens of thousands), which will be understandable 
            to the Indian reader, but not to those who are not conversant with either 
            Panjaabi or Gurmukhi. He also includes words such as 'sans', a French 
            term meaning 'without'. This term, unfortunately, will be meaningless 
            to the less erudite reader. As mentioned above, other antiquated expressions 
            abound, such as apostates, myrmidons, mumpers, mammon, etc. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He often uses phrases 
            which are not grammatically correct, such as, 'Even though one be silent 
            and remains absorbed constantly he obtains not mind's silence.' And, 
            similarly to Bhai Gopal Singh, he inserts parenthetical phrases of words 
            not actually in the original Gurmukhi, which are intended to more fully 
            elucidate the meaning of the passage. Again, the use of parentheses 
            is usually distracting. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Gurbachan Singh 
            Talib takes much wider license with the Guru's Word, so that the original 
            is often not even locatable in the translation. While all others have 
            translated 'soch' in the first Pauree of Jap Ji as 'thought' or 'conceptualization', 
            he alone translates it as 'ritual purification'. And when translating 
            'Hai bhee sach, Naanak hosee bhee sach', instead of the accepted translation 
            of 'sach' as'Truth', he translates these lines as, 'Nothing is real 
            but the Eternal. Nothing shall last but the Eternal.' Instead of parentheses 
            to denote words and phrases added to the translation which are not in 
            the original, he uses italics, which is still distracting. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> His grammatical 
            phrasing also frequently fails to conform to standard usage: 'How then 
            to become true to the Creator? how demolish the wall of illusion?' </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As with the previous 
            translations, these grammatical errors stick out to the well-versed 
            reader of English, and detract from their impact. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Pritam Singh Chahil's 
            translation more closely approximates readable English in its phraseology 
            and idioms, and this translation is now the premiere translation, the 
            standard by which others will be compared. But his grammar, once again, 
            falls short of the mark: For example,'. . . even though one may think 
            million times.', and 'The hunger of the hungry does not appease even 
            though one may collect loads of worldly valuables.' </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Khalsa Consensus 
            Translation has been written in contemporary English, maintaining consistent 
            grammar. The idioms are those in common usage, and word order reflects 
            the original whenever possible. Repeated words in the original are faithfully 
            repeated in the translation. For example: 'Simaro simar simar sukh paavao' 
            -'Meditate, meditate, meditate in remembrance, and find peace.' Page 
            breaks are exactly correlated with the original single-volume Bir. </font></p>
