      <p> The Kaurvas, who had brothers like Duryodhan, used to proclaim,
  &quot;This is ours! This is ours!&quot; Their royal procession
        extended over sixty miles, and yet their bodies were eaten by
        vultures.  || 2 ||   Sri Lanka was totally rich with gold; was
        anyone greater than its ruler Raavan? What happened to the elephants,
        tethered at his gate? In an instant, it all belonged to someone
        else.  || 3 ||   The Yaadvas deceived Durbaasaa, and received
        their rewards. The Lord has shown mercy to His humble servant,
        and now Naam Dayv sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  ||
        4 || 1 ||   I have brought the ten sensory organs under my control,
        and erased every trace of the five thieves. I have filled the
        seventy-two thousand nerve channels with Ambrosial Nectar, and
        drained out the poison.  || 1 ||   I shall not come into the world
        again. I chant the Ambrosial Bani of the Word from the depths
        of my heart, and I have instructed my soul.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        I fell at the Guru's feet and begged of Him; with the mighty
        axe, I have chopped off emotional attachment. Turning away from
        the world, I have become the servant of the Saints; I fear no
        one except the Lord's devotees.  || 2 ||   I shall be released
        from this world, when I stop clinging to Maya. Maya is the name
        of the power which causes us to be born; renouncing it, we obtain
        the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.  || 3 ||   That
        humble being, who performs devotional worship in this way, is
        rid of all fear. Says Naam Dayv, why are you wandering around
        out there? This is the way to find the Lord.  || 4 || 2 ||   As
        water is very precious in the desert, and the creeper weeds are
        dear to the camel, and the tune of the hunter's bell at night
        is enticing to the deer, so is the Lord to my mind.  || 1 || 
        Your Name is so beautiful! Your form is so beautiful! Your Love
        is so very beautiful, O my Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As rain
        is dear to the earth, and the flower's fragrance is dear
        to the bumble bee, and the mango is dear to the cuckoo, so is
        the Lord to my mind.  || 2 ||   As the sun is dear to the chakvi
        duck, and the lake of Man Sarovar is dear to the swan, and the
        husband is dear to his wife, so is the Lord to my mind.  || 3
        ||   As milk is dear to the baby, and the raindrop is dear to
        the mouth of the sparrow-hawk, as as water is dear to the fish,
        so is the Lord to my mind.  || 4 ||   All the seekers, Siddhas
        and silent sages seek Him, but only a rare few behold Him. Just
        as Your Name is dear to all the Universe, so is the Lord dear
        to Naam Dayv's mind.  || 5 || 3 ||   First of all, the lotuses
        bloomed in the woods; from them, all the swan-souls came into
        being. Know that, through Krishna, the Lord, Har, Har, the dance
        of creation dances.  || 1 ||   First of all, there was only the
        Primal Being. From that Primal Being, Maya was produced. All that
        is, is His. In this Garden of the Lord, we all dance, like water
        in the pots of the Persian wheel.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Women
        and men both dance. There is no other than the Lord. Don't
        dispute this, and don't doubt this. </p>

      <p> The Lord says, &quot;This creation and I are one and the same.&quot;
        || 2 ||   Like the pots on the Persian wheel, sometimes the world
        is high, and sometimes it is low. Wandering and roaming around,
        I have come at last to Your Door. &quot;Who are you?&quot;  &quot;I
        am Naam Dayv, Sir.&quot; O Lord, please save me from Maya, the
        cause of death.  || 3 || 4 ||   O Lord, You are the Purifier of
        sinners  -  this is Your innate nature. Blessed are those silent
        sages and humble beings, who meditate on my Lord God.  || 1 ||
        I have applied to my forehead the dust of the feet of the Lord
        of the Universe. This is something which is far away from the
        gods, mortal men and silent sages.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Lord,
        Merciful to the meek, Destroyer of pride  -  Naam Dayv seeks
        the Sanctuary of Your feet; he is a sacrifice to You.  || 2 ||

        DHANAASAREE,  DEVOTEE RAVI DAAS JEE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> There is none as forlorn as I am, and none as Compassionate as
        You; what need is there to test us now? May my mind surrender
        to Your Word; please, bless Your humble servant with this perfection.
        || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Lord. O Lord,
        why are You silent?  ||  Pause  ||   For so many incarnations,
        I have been separated from You, Lord; I dedicate this life to
        You. Says Ravi Daas: placing my hopes in You, I live; it is so
        long since I have gazed upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
        || 2 || 1 ||   In my consciousness, I remember You in meditation;
        with my eyes, I behold You; I fill my ears with the Word of Your
        Bani, and Your Sublime Praise. My mind is the bumble bee; I enshrine
        Your feet within my heart, and with my tongue, I chant the Ambrosial
        Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   My love for the Lord of the Universe
        does not decrease. I paid for it dearly, in exchange for my soul.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, love for the Lord does not well up; without this love,
        Your devotional worship cannot be performed. Ravi Daas offers
        this one prayer unto the Lord: please preserve and protect my
        honor, O Lord, my King.  || 2 || 2 ||   Your Name, Lord, is my
        adoration and cleansing bath. Without the Name of the Lord, all
        ostentatious displays are useless.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your
        Name is my prayer mat, and Your Name is the stone to grind the
        sandalwood. Your Name is the saffron which I take and sprinkle
        in offering to You. Your Name is the water, and Your Name is the
        sandalwood. The chanting of Your Name is the grinding of the sandalwood.
        I take it and offer all this to You.  || 1 ||   Your Name is the
        lamp, and Your Name is the wick. Your Name is the oil I pour into
        it. Your Name is the light applied to this lamp, which enlightens
        and illuminates the entire world.  || 2 ||   Your Name is the
        thread, and Your Name is the garland of flowers. The eighteen
        loads of vegetation are all too impure to offer to You. Why should
        I offer to You, that which You Yourself created? Your Name is
        the fan, which I wave over You.  || 3 ||   The whole world is
        engrossed in the eighteen Puraanas, the sixty-eight sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage, and the four sources of creation. Says Ravi Daas,
        Your Name is my Aartee, my lamp-lit worship-service. The True
        Name, Sat Naam, is the food which I offer to You.  || 4 || 3 || </p>

        DHANAASAREE,  THE WORD OF DEVOTEE TRILOCHAN JEE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Why do you slander the Lord? You are ignorant and deluded. Pain
        and pleasure are the result of your own actions.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The moon dwells in Shiva's forehead; it takes its cleansing
        bath in the Ganges. Among the men of the moon's family, Krishna
        was born; even so, the stains from its past actions remain on
        the moon's face.  || 1 ||   Aruna was a charioteer; his master
        was the sun, the lamp of the world. His brother was Garuda, the
        king of birds; and yet, Aruna was made a cripple, because of the
        karma of his past actions.  || 2 ||   Shiva, the destroyer of
        countless sins, the Lord and Master of the three worlds, wandered
        from sacred shrine to sacred shrine; he never found an end to
        them. And yet, he could not erase the karma of cutting off Brahma's
        head.  || 3 ||   Through the nectar, the moon, the wish-fulfilling
        cow, Lakshmi, the miraculous tree of life, Sikhar the sun's
        horse, and Dhanavantar the wise physician  -  all arose from
        the ocean, the lord of rivers; and yet, because of its karma,
        its saltiness has not left it.  || 4 ||   Hanuman burnt the fortress
        of Sri Lanka, uprooted the garden of Raawan, and brought healing
        herbs for the wounds of Lachhman, pleasing Lord Raamaa; and yet,
        because of his karma, he could not be rid of his loin cloth. 
        || 5 ||   The karma of past actions cannot be erased, O wife of
        my house; this is why I chant the Name of the Lord. So prays Trilochan,
        Dear Lord.  || 6 || 1 ||   SRI SAIN:  With incense, lamps and
        ghee, I offer this lamp-lit worship service. I am a sacrifice
        to the Lord of Lakshmi.  || 1 ||   Hail to You, Lord, hail to
        You! Again and again, hail to You, Lord King, Ruler of all!  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Sublime is the lamp, and pure is the wick. You
        are immaculate and pure, O Brilliant Lord of Wealth!  || 2 ||
        Raamaanand knows the devotional worship of the Lord. He says
        that the Lord is all-pervading, the embodiment of supreme joy.
        || 3 ||   The Lord of the world, of wondrous form, has carried
        me across the terrifying world-ocean. Says Sain, remember the
        Lord, the embodiment of supreme joy!  || 4 || 2 ||   PEEPAA: 
        Within the body, the Divine Lord is embodied. The body is the
        temple, the place of pilgrimage, and the pilgrim. Within the body
        are incense, lamps and offerings. Within the body are the flower
        offerings.  || 1 ||   I searched throughout many realms, but I
        found the nine treasures within the body. Nothing comes, and nothing
        goes; I pray to the Lord for Mercy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        One who pervades the Universe also dwells in the body; whoever
        seeks Him, finds Him there. Peepaa prays, the Lord is the supreme
        essence; He reveals Himself through the True Guru.  || 2 || 3
        ||   DHANNAA:  O Lord of the world, this is Your lamp-lit worship
        service. You are the Arranger of the affairs of those humble beings
        who perform Your devotional worship service.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Lentils, flour and ghee  -  these things, I beg of You.
        My mind shall ever be pleased. Shoes, fine clothes, and grain
        of seven kinds  -  I beg of You.  || 1 ||   A milk cow, and
        a water buffalo, I beg of You, and a fine Turkestani horse. A
        good wife to care for my home  -  Your humble servant Dhanna
        begs for these things, Lord.  || 2 || 4 || <br>
