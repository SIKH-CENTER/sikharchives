      <p> Please bless me with the gift of contentment, that I may receive
        the True Name as my Support.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        Through the night the time ticks away; through the day the time
        ticks away. The body wears away and turns to straw. All are involved
        and entangled in worldly entanglements. The mortal has mistakenly
        renounced the way of service. The blind fool is caught in conflict,
        bothered and bewildered. Those who weep after someone has died
        - can they bring him back to life? Without realization,
        nothing can be understood. The weepers who weep for the dead shall
        themselves die as well. O Nanak, this is the Will of our Lord
        and Master. Those who do not remember the Lord, are dead.  ||
        1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Love dies, and affection dies; hatred and
        strife die. The color fades, and beauty vanishes; the body suffers
        and collapses. Where did he come from? Where is he going? Did
        he exist or not? The self-willed manmukh made empty boasts, indulging
        in parties and pleasures. O Nanak, without the True Name, his
        honor is torn away, from head to foot.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The
        Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is forever the Giver of
        peace. It shall be your Help and Support in the end. Without the
        Guru, the world is insane. It does not appreciate the worth of
        the Name. Those who serve the True Guru are accepted and approved.
        Their light merges into the Light. That servant who enshrines
        the Lord's Will within his mind, becomes just like his
        Lord and Master. Tell me, who has ever found peace by following
        his own will? The blind act in blindness. No one is ever satisfied
        and fulfilled by evil and corruption. The hunger of the fool is
        not satisfied. Attached to duality, all are ruined; without the
        True Guru, there is no understanding. Those who serve the True
        Guru find peace; they are blessed with Grace by the Will of the
        Lord.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Modesty and righteousness
        both, O Nanak, are qualities of those who are blessed with true
        wealth. Do not refer to that wealth as your friend, which leads
        you to get your head beaten. Those who possess only this worldly
        wealth are known as paupers. But those, within whose hearts You
        dwell, O Lord - those people are oceans of virtue.  ||
        1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Worldly possessions are obtained by pain and
        suffering; when they are gone, they leave pain and suffering.
        O Nanak, without the True Name, hunger is never satisfied. Beauty
        does not satisfy hunger; when the man sees beauty, he hungers
        even more. As many as are the pleasures of the body, so many are
        the pains which afflict it.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Acting blindly,
        the mind becomes blind. The blind mind makes the body blind. Why
        make a dam with mud and plaster? Even a dam made of stones gives
        way. The dam has burst. There is no boat. There is no raft. The
        water's depth is unfathomable. O Nanak, without the True
        Name, many multitudes have drowned.  || 3 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Thousands
        of pounds of gold, and thousands of pounds of silver; the king
        over the heads of thousands of kings. Thousands of armies, thousands
        of marching bands and spearmen; the emperor of thousands of horsemen.
        The unfathomable ocean of fire and water must be crossed. The
        other shore cannot be seen; only the roar of pitiful cries can
        be heard. O Nanak, there, it shall be known, whether anyone is
        a king or an emperor.  || 4 ||   PAUREE:  Some have chains around
        their necks, in bondage to the Lord. <br>

      </p>
      <p> They are released from bondage, realizing the True Lord as True.
        One whose pre-ordained destiny is activated, comes to know the
        True Lord. By God's Command, it is ordained. When the mortal
        goes, he knows. Realize the Word of the Shabad, and cross over
        the terrifying world-ocean. Thieves, adulterers and gamblers are
        pressed like seeds in the mill. Slanderers and gossipers are hand-cuffed.
        The Gurmukh is absorbed in the True Lord, and is famous in the
        Court of the Lord.  || 21 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  The beggar
        is known as an emperor, and the fool is known as a religious scholar.
        The blind man is known as a seer; this is how people talk. The
        trouble-maker is called a leader, and the liar is seated with
        honor. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs know that this is justice in the
        Dark Age of Kali Yuga.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Deer, falcons and
        government officials are known to be trained and clever. When
        the trap is set, they trap their own kind; hereafter they will
        find no place of rest. He alone is learned and wise, and he alone
        is a scholar, who practices the Name. First, the tree puts down
        its roots, and then it spreads out its shade above. The kings
        are tigers, and their officials are dogs; they go out and awaken
        the sleeping people to harass them. The public servants inflict
        wounds with their nails. The dogs lick up the blood that is spilled.
        But there, in the Court of the Lord, all beings will be judged.
        Those who have violated the people's trust will be disgraced;
        their noses will be cut off.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself creates
        the world, and He himself takes care of it. Without the Fear of
        God, doubt is not dispelled, and love for the Name is not embraced.
        Through the True Guru, the Fear of God wells up, and the Door
        of Salvation is found. Through the Fear of God, intuitive ease
        is obtained, and one's light merges into the Light of the
        Infinite. Through the Fear of God, the terrifying world-ocean
        is crossed over, reflecting on the Guru's Teachings. Through
        the Fear of God, the Fearless Lord is found; He has no end or
        limitation. The self-willed manmukhs do not appreciate the value
        of the Fear of God. Burning in desire, they weep and wail. O Nanak,
        through the Name, peace is obtained, by enshrining the Guru's
        Teachings within the heart.  || 22 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL: 
        Beauty and sexual desire are friends; hunger and tasty food are
        tied together. Greed is bound up in its search for wealth, and
        sleep will use even a tiny space as a bed. Anger barks and brings
        ruin on itself, blindly pursuing useless conflicts. It is good
        to be silent, O Nanak; without the Name, one's mouth spews
        forth only filth.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Royal power, wealth,
        beauty, social status and youth are the five thieves. These thieves
        have plundered the world; no one's honor has been spared.
        But these thieves themselves are robbed, by those who fall at
        the Guru's Feet. O Nanak, the multitudes who do not have
        good karma are plundered.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The learned and
        educated are called to account for their actions. Without the
        Name, they are judged false; they become miserable and suffer
        hardship. Their path becomes treacherous and difficult, and their
        way is blocked. Through the Shabad, the Word of the True and Independent
        Lord God, one becomes content. The Lord is deep and profound and
        unfathomable; His depth cannot be measured. Without the Guru,
        the mortals are beaten and punched in the face and the mouth,
        and no one is released. Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        one returns to his true home with honor. Know that the Lord, by
        the Hukam of His Command, gives sustenance and the breath of life.

      </p>
      <p> SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Living beings are formed of air, water and
        fire. They are subject to pleasure and pain. In this world, in
        the nether regions of the underworld, and in the Akaashic ethers
        of the heavens, some remain ministers in the Court of the Lord.
        Some live long lives, while others suffer and die. Some give and
        consume, and still their wealth is not exhausted, while others
        remain poor forever. In His Will He creates, and in His Will He
        destroys thousands in an instant. He has harnessed everyone with
        His harness; when He forgives, he breaks the harness. He has no
        color or features; He is invisible and beyond calculation. How
        can He be described? He is known as the Truest of the True. All
        the actions which are done and described, O Nanak, are done by
        the Indescribable Lord Himself. Whoever hears the description
        of the indescribable, is blessed with wealth, intelligence, perfection,
        spiritual wisdom and eternal peace.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  One
        who bears the unbearable, controls the nine holes of the body.
        One who worships and adores the Lord with his breath of life,
        gains stability in his body-wall. Where has he come from, and
        where will he go? Remaining dead while yet alive, he is accepted
        and approved. Whoever understands the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command, realizes the essence of reality. This is known by Guru's
        Grace. O Nanak, know this: egotism leads to bondage. Only those
        who have no ego and no self-conceit, are not consigned to reincarnation.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Read the Praise of the Lord's Name;
        other intellectual pursuits are false. Without dealing in Truth,
        life is worthless. No one has ever found the Lord's end
        or limitation. All the world is enveloped by the darkness of egotistical
        pride. It does not like the Truth. Those who depart from this
        world, forgetting the Naam, shall be roasted in the frying pan.
        They pour the oil of duality within, and burn. They come into
        the world and wander around aimlessly; they depart when the play
        is finished. O Nanak, imbued with Truth, the mortals merge in
        Truth.  || 24 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  First, the mortal is
        conceived in the flesh, and then he dwells in the flesh. When
        he comes alive, his mouth takes flesh; his bones, skin and body
        are flesh. He comes out of the womb of flesh, and takes a mouthful
        of flesh at the breast. His mouth is flesh, his tongue is flesh;
        his breath is in the flesh. He grows up and is married, and brings
        his wife of flesh into his home. Flesh is produced from flesh;
        all relatives are made of flesh. When the mortal meets the True
        Guru, and realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then
        he comes to be reformed. Releasing himself, the mortal does not
        find release; O Nanak, through empty words, one is ruined.  ||
        1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The fools argue about flesh and meat, but
        they know nothing about meditation and spiritual wisdom. What
        is called meat, and what is called green vegetables? What leads
        to sin? It was the habit of the gods to kill the rhinoceros, and
        make a feast of the burnt offering. Those who renounce meat, and
        hold their noses when sitting near it, devour men at night. They
        practice hypocrisy, and make a show before other people, but they
        do not understand anything about meditation or spiritual wisdom.
        O Nanak, what can be said to the blind people? They cannot answer,
        or even understand what is said. They alone are blind, who act
        blindly. They have no eyes in their hearts. They are produced
        from the blood of their mothers and fathers, but they do not eat
        fish or meat. <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> But when men and women meet in the night, they come together in
        the flesh. In the flesh we are conceived, and in the flesh we
        are born; we are vessels of flesh. You know nothing of spiritual
        wisdom and meditation, even though you call yourself clever, O
        religious scholar. O master, you believe that flesh on the outside
        is bad, but the flesh of those in your own home is good. All beings
        and creatures are flesh; the soul has taken up its home in the
        flesh. They eat the uneatable; they reject and abandon what they
        could eat. They have a teacher who is blind. In the flesh we are
        conceived, and in the flesh we are born; we are vessels of flesh.
        You know nothing of spiritual wisdom and meditation, even though
        you call yourself clever, O religious scholar. Meat is allowed
        in the Puraanas, meat is allowed in the Bible and the Koran. Throughout
        the four ages, meat has been used. It is featured in sacred feasts
        and marriage festivities; meat is used in them. Women, men, kings
        and emperors originate from meat. If you see them going to hell,
        then do not accept charitable gifts from them. The giver goes
        to hell, while the receiver goes to heaven - look at this
        injustice. You do not understand your own self, but you preach
        to other people. O Pandit, you are very wise indeed. O Pandit,
        you do not know where meat originated. Corn, sugar cane and cotton
        are produced from water. The three worlds came from water. Water
        says, &quot;I am good in many ways.&quot; But water takes many
        forms. Forsaking these delicacies, one becomes a true Sannyaasee,
        a detached hermit. Nanak reflects and speaks.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        What can I say with only one tongue? I cannot find your limits.
        Those who contemplate the True Word of the Shabad are absorbed
        into You, O Lord. Some wander around in saffron robes, but without
        the True Guru, no one finds the Lord. They wander in foreign lands
        and countries until they grow weary, but You hide Yourself within
        them. The Word of the Guru's Shabad is a jewel, through
        which the Lord shines forth and reveals Himself. Realizing one's
        own self, following the Guru's Teachings, the mortal is
        absorbed into Truth. Coming and going, the tricksters and magicians
        put on their magic show. But those whose minds are pleased by
        the True Lord, praise the True One, the Ever-stable Lord.  ||
        25 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, the tree of actions done
        in Maya yields ambrosial fruit and poisonous fruit. The Creator
        does all deeds; we eat the fruits as He ordains.  || 1 ||   SECOND
        MEHL:  O Nanak, burn worldly greatness and glory in the fire.
        These burnt offerings have caused mortals to forget the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Not even one of them will go along with
        you in the end.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He judges each and every being;
        by the Hukam of His Command, He leads us on. Justice is in Your
        Hands, O Lord; You are pleasing to my mind. The mortal is bound
        and gagged by Death and lead away; no one can rescue him. Old
        age, the tyrant, dances on the mortal's shoulders. So climb
        aboard the boat of the True Guru, and the True Lord will rescue
        you. The fire of desire burns like an oven, consuming mortals
        night and day. Like trapped birds, the mortals peck at the corn;
        only through the Lord's Command will they find release.
        Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass; falsehood shall fail
        in the end.  || 26 || <br>

      <p> SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  The True Guru is the All-knowing Primal
        Being; He shows us our true home within the home of the self.
        The Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds, resonate and resound
        within; the insignia of the Shabad is revealed there, vibrating
        gloriously. Worlds and realms, nether regions, solar systems and
        galaxies are wondrously revealed. The strings and the harps vibrate
        and resound; the true throne of the Lord is there. Listen to the
        music of the home of the heart - Sukhmani, peace of mind.
        Lovingly tune in to His state of celestial ecstasy. Contemplate
        the Unspoken Speech, and the desires of the mind are dissolved.
        The heart-lotus is turned upside-down, and is filled with Ambrosial
        Nectar. This mind does not go out; it does not get distracted.
        It does not forget the Chant which is chanted without chanting;
        it is immersed in the Primal Lord God of the ages. All the sister-companions
        are blessed with the five virtues. The Gurmukhs dwell in the home
        of the self deep within. Nanak is the slave of that one who seeks
        the Shabad and finds this home within.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        The extravagant glamor of the world is a passing show. My twisted
        mind does not believe that it will end up in a grave. I am meek
        and lowly; You are the great river. Please, bless me with the
        one thing; everything else is poison, and does not tempt me. You
        filled this fragile body with the water of life, O Lord, by Your
        Creative Power. By Your Omnipotence, I have become powerful. Nanak
        is a dog in the Court of the Lord, intoxicated more and more,
        all the time. The world is on fire; the Name of the Lord is cooling
        and soothing.  || 2 ||   NEW PAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  His wonderful
        play is all-pervading; it is wonderful and amazing! As Gurmukh,
        I know the the Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God. All the
        residues of sin and corruption are washed away, through the insignia
        of the Shabad, the Word of God. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, one is saved, and becomes free. Meditating, meditating
        in remembrance on the Great Giver, I enjoy all comforts and pleasures.
        I have become famous throughout the world, under the canopy of
        His kindness and grace. He Himself has forgiven me, and united
        me with Himself; I am forever a sacrifice to Him. O Nanak, by
        the Pleasure of His Will, my Lord and Master has blended me with
        Himself.  || 27 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Blessed is the paper,
        blessed is the pen, blessed is the inkwell, and blessed is the
        ink. Blessed is the writer, O Nanak, who writes the True Name.
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  You Yourself are the writing tablet, and
        You Yourself are the pen. You are also what is written on it.
        Speak of the One Lord, O Nanak; how could there be any other?
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You Yourself are all-pervading; You Yourself
        made the making. Without You, there is no other at all; You are
        permeating and pervading everywhere. You alone know Your state
        and extent. Only You can estimate Your worth. You are invisible,
        imperceptible and inaccessible. You are revealed through the Guru's
        Teachings. Deep within, there is ignorance, suffering and doubt;
        through the spiritual wisdom of the Guru, they are eradicated.
        He alone meditates on the Naam, whom You unite with Yourself,
        in Your Mercy. You are the Creator, the Inaccessible Primal Lord
        God; You are all-pervading everywhere. To whatever You link the
        mortal, O True Lord, to that he is linked. Nanak sings Your Glorious
        Praises.  || 28 || 1 ||  SUDH  || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Serve the King, the Sovereign Lord of the
        World. He has no ancestry; He is immaculate and pure. Please bless
        me with the gift of devotion, which the humble Saints beg for.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   His Home is the pavilion seen in all directions;
        His ornamental heavenly realms fill the seven worlds alike. In
        His Home, the virgin Lakshmi dwells. The moon and the sun are
        His two lamps; the wretched Messenger of Death stages his dramas,
        and levies taxes on all. Such is my Sovereign Lord King, the Supreme
        Lord of all.  || 1 ||   In His House, the four-faced Brahma, the
        cosmic potter lives. He created the entire universe. In His House,
        the insane Shiva, the Guru of the World, lives; he imparts spiritual
        wisdom to expain the essence of reality. Sin and virtue are the
        standard-bearers at His Door; Chitr and Gupt are the recording
        angels of the conscious and subconscious. The Righteous Judge
        of Dharma, the Lord of Destruction, is the door-man. Such is the
        Supreme Sovereign Lord of the World.  || 2 ||   In His Home are
        the heavenly heralds, celestial singers, Rishis and poor minstrels,
        who sing so sweetly. All the Shaastras take various forms in His
        theater, singing beautiful songs. The wind waves the fly-brush
        over Him; His hand-maiden is Maya, who has conquered the world.
        The shell of the earth is His fireplace. Such is the Sovereign
        Lord of the three worlds.  || 3 ||   In His Home, the celestial
        turtle is the bed-frame, woven with the strings of the thousand-headed
        snake. His flower-girls are the eighteen loads of vegetation;
        His water-carriers are the nine hundred sixty million clouds.
        His sweat is the Ganges River. The seven seas are His water-pitchers.
        The creatures of the world are His household utensils. Such is
        the Sovereign Lord King of the three worlds.  || 4 ||   In His
        home are Arjuna, Dhroo, Prahlaad, Ambreek, Naarad, Nayjaa, the
        Siddhas and Buddhas, the ninety-two heavenly heralds and celestial
        singers in their wondrous play. All the creatures of the world
        are in His House. The Lord is diffused in the inner beings of
        all. Prays Naam Dayv, seek His Protection. All the devotees are
        His banner and insignia.  || 5 || 1 ||   MALAAR:  Please do not
        forget me; please do not forget me, please do not forget me, O
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The temple priests have doubts about
        this, and everyone is furious with me. Calling me low-caste and
        untouchable, they beat me and drove me out; what should I do now,
        O Beloved Father Lord?  || 1 ||   If You liberate me after I am
        dead, no one will know that I am liberated. These Pandits, these
        religious scholars, call me low-born; when they say this, they
        tarnish Your honor as well.  || 2 ||   You are called kind and
        compassionate; the power of Your Arm is absolutely unrivalled. <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">O humble townspeople, I am obviously just
        a shoemaker. In my heart I cherish the Glories of the Lord, the
        Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Even if wine is made
        from the water of the Ganges, O Saints, do not drink it. This
        wine, and any other polluted water which mixes with the Ganges,
        is not separate from it.  || 1 ||   The palmyra palm tree is considered
        impure, and so its leaves are considered impure as well. But if
        devotional prayers are written on paper made from its leaves,
        then people bow in reverence and worship before it.  || 2 || 
        It is my occupation to prepare and cut leather; each day, I carry
        the carcasses out of the city. Now, the important Brahmins of
        the city bow down before me; Ravi Daas, Your slave, seeks the
        Sanctuary of Your Name.  || 3 || 1 ||   MALAAR:  Those humble
        beings who meditate on the Lord's Lotus Feet - none
        are equal to them. The Lord is One, but He is diffused in many
        forms. Bring in, bring in, that All-pervading Lord.  ||  Pause
        ||   He who writes the Praises of the Lord God, and sees nothing
        else at all, is a low-class, untouchable fabric-dyer by trade.
        The Glory of the Name is seen in the writings of Vyaas and Sanak,
        throughout the seven continents.  || 1 ||   And he whose family
        used to kill cows at the festivals of Eed and Bakareed, who worshipped
        Shayks, martyrs and spiritual teachers, whose father used to do
        such things - his son Kabeer became so successful that
        he is now famous throughout the three worlds.  || 2 ||   And all
        the leather-workers in those families still go around Benares
        removing the dead cattle - the ritualistic Brahmins bow
        in reverence before their son Ravi Daas, the slave of the Lord's
        slaves.  || 3 || 2 || <br>

        long shall I remain asleep?  || 1 ||   Whatever I was attached
        to, has perished. The shop of false merchandise has closed down.
