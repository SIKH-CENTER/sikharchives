      <p> Searching, searching, I have seen Him in each and every heart.
        I am a sacrifice to one who sees, and inspires others to see Him.
        By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status.  ||
        1 ||   Whose Name should I chant, and meditate on, except the
        Lord of the Universe? Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is revealed within the
        home of one's own heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Second
        Day: Those who are in love with another, come to regret and repent.
        The are tied up at Death's door, and continue coming and
        going. What have they brought, and what will they take with them
        when they go? The Messenger of Death looms over their heads, and
        they endure his beating. Without the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, no one finds release. Practicing hypocrisy, no one finds
        liberation.  || 2 ||   The True Lord Himself created the universe,
        joining the elements together. Breaking the cosmic egg, He united,
        and separated. He made the earth and the sky into places to live.
        He created day and night, fear and love. The One who created the
        Creation, also watches over it. There is no other Creator Lord.
        || 3 ||   The Third Day: He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva,
        the gods, goddesses and various manifestations. The lights and
        forms cannot be counted. The One who fashioned them, knows their
        value. He evaluates them, and totally pervades them. Who is close,
        and who is far away?  || 4 ||   The Fourth Day: He created the
        four Vedas, the four sources of creation, and distinct forms of
        speech. He created the eighteen Puraanas, the six Shaastras and
        the three qualities. He alone understands, whom the Lord causes
        to understand. One who overcomes the three qualities, dwells in
        the fourth state. Prays Nanak, I am his slave.  || 5 ||   The
        Fifth Day: The five elements are demons. The Lord Himself is unfathomable
        and detached. Some are gripped by doubt, hunger, emotional attachment
        and desire. Some taste the sublime essence of the Shabad, and
        are satisfied. Some are imbued with the Lord's Love, while
        some die, and are reduced to dust. Some attain the Court and the
        Mansion of the True Lord, and behold Him, ever-present.  || 6
        ||   The false one has no honor or fame; like the black crow,
        he never becomes pure. He is like the bird, imprisoned in a cage;
        he paces back and forth behind the bars, but he is not released.
        He alone is emancipated, whom the Lord and Master emancipates.
        He follows the Guru's Teachings, and enshrines devotional
        worship.  || 7 ||   The Sixth Day: God organized the six systems
        of Yoga. The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates of
        itself. If God wills it so, then one is summoned to the Mansion
        of His Presence. One who is pierced through by the Shabad, obtains
        honor. Those who wear religious robes burn, and are ruined. Through
        Truth, the truthful ones merge into the True Lord.  || 8 ||  
        The Seventh Day: When the body is imbued with Truth and contentment,
        the seven seas within are filled with the Immaculate Water. Bathing
        in good conduct, and contemplating the True Lord within the heart,
        one obtains the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and carries
        everyone across. With the True Lord in the mind, and the True
        Lord lovingly on one's lips, one is blessed with the banner
        of Truth, and meets with no obstructions.  || 9 ||   The Eighth
        Day: The eight miraculous powers come when one subdues his own
        mind, and contemplates the True Lord through pure actions. Forget
        the three qualities of wind, water and fire, and concentrate on
        the pure True Name. That human who remains lovingly focused on
        the Lord, prays Nanak, shall not be consumed by death.  || 10
        ||   The Ninth Day: The Name is the supreme almighty Master of
        the nine masters of Yoga, the nine realms of the earth, and each
        and every heart. <br>

      <p> This whole world is the child of Maya. I bow in submission to
        God, my Protector from the very beginning of time. He was in the
        beginning, He has been throughout the ages, He is now, and He
        shall always be. He is unlimited, and capable of doing everything.
        || 11 ||   The Tenth Day: Meditate on the Naam, give to charity,
        and purify yourself. Night and day, bathe in spiritual wisdom
        and the Glorious Virtues of the True Lord. Truth cannot be polluted;
        doubt and fear run away from it. The flimsy thread breaks in an
        instant. Know that the world is just like this thread. Your consciousness
        shall become steady and stable, enjoying the Love of the True
        Lord.  || 12 ||   The Eleventh Day: Enshrine the One Lord within
        your heart. Eradicate cruelty, egotism and emotional attachment.
        Earn the fruitful rewards, by observing the fast of knowing your
        own self. One who is engrossed in hypocrisy, does not see the
        true essence. The Lord is immaculate, self-sustaining and unattached.
        The Pure, True Lord cannot be polluted.  || 13 ||   Wherever I
        look, I see the One Lord there. He created the other beings, of
        many and various kinds. Eating only fruits, one loses the fruits
        of life. Eating only delicacies of various sorts, one loses the
        true taste. In fraud and greed, people are engrossed and entangled.
        The Gurmukh is emancipated, practicing Truth.  || 14 ||   The
        Twelfth Day: One whose mind is not attached to the twelve signs,
        remains awake day and night, and never sleeps. He remains awake
        and aware, lovingly centered on the Lord. With faith in the Guru,
        he is not consumed by death. Those who become detached, and conquer
        the five enemies - prays Nanak, they are lovingly absorbed
        in the Lord.  || 15 ||   The Twelfth Day: Know, and practice,
        compassion and charity. Bring your out-going mind back home. Observe
        the fast of remaining free of desire. Chant the unchanted Chant
        of the Naam with your mouth. Know that the One Lord is contained
        in the three worlds. Purity and self-discipline are all contained
        in knowing the Truth.  || 16 ||   The Thirteenth Day: He is like
        a tree on the sea-shore. But his roots can become immortal, if
        his mind is attuned to the Lord's Love. Then, he will not
        die of fear or anxiety, and he will never drown. Without the Fear
        of God, he drowns and dies, and loses his honor. With the Fear
        of God in his heart, and his heart in the Fear of God, he knows
        God. He sits on the throne, and becomes pleasing to the Mind of
        the True Lord.  || 17 ||   The Fourteenth Day: One who enters
        into the fourth state, overcomes time, and the three qualities
        of raajas, taamas and satva. Then the sun enters into the house
        of the moon, and one knows the value of the technology of Yoga.
        He remains lovingly focused on God, who is permeating the fourteen
        worlds, the nether regions of the underworld, the galaxies and
        solar systems.  || 18 ||   Amaavas - The Night of the New
        Moon: The moon is hidden in the sky. O wise one, understand and
        contemplate the Word of the Shabad. The moon in the sky illuminates
        the three worlds. Creating the creation, the Creator beholds it.
        One who sees, through the Guru, merges into Him. The self-willed
        manmukhs are deluded, coming and going in reincarnation.  || 19
        ||   One who establishes his home within his own heart, obtains
        the most beautiful, permanent place. One comes to understand his
        own self, when he finds the True Guru. Wherever there is hope,
        there is destruction and desolation. The bowl of duality and selfishness
        breaks. Prays Nanak, I am the slave of that one, who remains detached
        amidst the traps of attachment.  || 20 || 1 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Sunday: He, the Lord, is the Primal Being.
        He Himself is the Pervading Lord; there is no other at all. Through
        and through, He is woven into the fabric of the world. Whatever
        the Creator Himself does, that alone happens. Imbued with the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is forever in peace. But how rare
        is the one, who, as Gurmukh, understands this.  || 1 ||   Within
        my heart, I chant the Chant of the Lord, the treasure of virtue.
        The Lord, my Lord and Master, is inaccessible, unfathomable and
        unlimited. Grasping the feet of the Lord's humble servants,
        I meditate on Him, and become the slave of His slaves.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Monday: The True Lord is permeating and pervading.
        His value cannot be described. Talking and speaking about Him,
        all keep themselves lovingly focused on Him. Devotion falls into
        the laps of those whom He so blesses. He is inaccessible and unfathomable;
        He cannot be seen. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        the Lord is seen to be permeating and pervading everywhere.  ||
        2 ||   Tuesday: The Lord created love and attachment to Maya.
        He Himself has enjoined each and every being to their tasks. He
        alone understands, whom the Lord causes to understand. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one understands his heart
        and home. He worships the Lord in loving devotion. His egotism
        and self-conceit are burnt away by the Shabad.  || 3 ||   Wednesday:
        He Himself bestows sublime understanding. The Gurmukh does good
        deeds, and contemplates the Word of the Shabad. Imbued with the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind become pure and immaculate.
        He sings the Glorious Glorious Praises of the Lord, and washes
        off the filth of egotism. In the Court of the True Lord, he obtains
        lasting glory. Imbued with the Naam, he is embellished with the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 4 ||   The profit of the
        Naam is obtained through the Door of the Guru. The Great Giver
        Himself gives it. I am a sacrifice to the One who gives it. By
        Guru's Grace, self-conceit is eradicated. O Nanak, enshrine
        the Naam within your heart. I celebrate the victory of the Lord,
        the Great Giver.  || 5 ||   Thursday: The fifty-two warriors were
        deluded by doubt. All the goblins and demons are attached to duality.
        God Himself created them, and sees each one distinct. O Creator
        Lord, You are the Support of all. The beings and creatures are
        under Your protection. He alone meets You, whom You Yourself meet.
        || 6 ||   Friday: God is permeating and pervading everywhere.
        He Himself created all, and appraises the value of all. One who
        become Gurmukh, contemplates the Lord. He practices truth and
        self-restraint. Without genuine understanding, all fasts, religious
        rituals and daily worship services lead only to the love of duality.
        || 7 ||   Saturday: Contemplating good omens and the Shaastras,
        in egotism and self-conceit, the world wanders in delusion. The
        blind, self-willed manmukh in engrossed in the love of duality.
        Bound and gagged at death's door, he is beaten and punished.
        By Guru's Grace, one finds lasting peace. He practices
        Truth, and lovingly focuses on the Truth.  || 8 ||   Those who
        serve the True Guru are very fortunate. Conquering their ego,
        they embrace love for the True Lord. They are automatically imbued
        with Your Love, O Lord. <br>

      <p> You are the Giver of peace; You merge them into Yourself. Everything
        comes from the One and only Lord; there is no other at all. The
        Gurmukh realizes this, and understands.  || 9 ||   The fifteen
        lunar days, the seven days of the week, the months, seasons, days
        and nights, come over and over again; so the world goes on. Coming
        and going were created by the Creator Lord. The True Lord remains
        steady and stable, by His almighty power. O Nanak, how rare is
        that Gurmukh who understands, and contemplates the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 10 || 1 ||   BILAAVAL,  THIRD MEHL:  The Primal
        Lord Himself formed the Universe. The beings and creatures are
        engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya. In the love of duality,
        they are attached to the illusory material world. The unfortunate
        ones die, and continue to come and go. Meeting with the True Guru,
        understanding is obtained. Then, the illusion of the material
        world is shattered, and one merges in Truth.  || 1 ||   One who
        has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead -
        the One God abides within his mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He created
        the Universe, and He Himself beholds all. No one can erase Your
        record, Lord. If someone calls himself a Siddha or a seeker, he
        is deluded by doubt, and will continue coming and going. That
        humble being alone understands, who serves the True Guru. Conquering
        his ego, he finds the Lord's Door.  || 2 ||   From the
        One Lord, all others were formed. The One Lord is pervading everywhere;
        there is no other at all. Renouncing duality, one comes to know
        the One Lord. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one
        knows the Lord's Door, and His Banner. Meeting the True
        Guru, one finds the One Lord. Duality is subdued within.  || 3
        ||   One who belongs to the All-powerful Lord and Master -
        no one can destroy him. The Lord's servant remains under
        His protection; The Lord Himself forgives him, and blesses him
        with glorious greatness. There is none higher than Him. Why should
        he be afraid? What should he ever fear?  || 4 ||   Through the
        Guru's Teachings, peace and tranquility abide within the
        body. Remember the Word of the Shabad, and you shall never suffer
        pain. You shall not have to come or go, or suffer in sorrow. Imbued
        with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you shall merge in celestial
        peace. O Nanak, the Gurmukh beholds Him ever-present, close at
        hand. My God is always fully pervading everywhere.  || 5 ||  
        Some are selfless servants, while others wander, deluded by doubt.
        The Lord Himself does, and causes everything to be done. The One
        Lord is all-pervading; there is no other at all. The mortal might
        complain, if there were any other. Serve the True Guru; this is
        the most excellent action. In the Court of the True Lord, you
        shall be judged true.  || 6 ||   All the lunar days, and the days
        of the week are beautiful, when one contemplates the Shabad. If
        one serves the True Guru, he obtains the fruits of his rewards.
        The omens and days all come and go. But the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad is eternal and unchanging. Through it, one merges in the
        True Lord. The days are auspicious, when one is imbued with Truth.
        Without the Name, all the false ones wander deluded.  || 7 ||
        The self-willed manmukhs die, and dead, they fall into the most
        evil state. They do not remember the One Lord; they are deluded
        by duality. The human body is unconscious, ignorant and blind.
        Without the Word of the Shabad, how can anyone cross over? The
        Creator Himself creates. He Himself contemplates the Guru's
        Word.  || 8 ||   The religious fanatics wear all sorts of religious
        robes. They roll around and wander around, like the false dice
        on the board. <br>

      </p>
      <p> They find no peace, here or hereafter. The self-willed manmukhs
        waste away their lives, and die. Serving the True Guru, doubt
        is driven away. Deep within the home of the heart, one finds the
        Mansion of the True Lord's Presence.  || 9 ||   Whatever
        the Perfect Lord does, that alone happens. Concern with these
        omens and days leads only to duality. Without the True Guru, there
        is only pitch darkness. Only idiots and fools worry about these
        omens and days. O Nanak, the Gurmukh obtains understanding and
        realization; he remains forever merged in the Name of the One
        Lord.  || 10 || 2 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The young, innocent soul-bride has come to
        the pasture lands of the world. Laying aside her pitcher of worldly
        concern, she lovingly attunes herself to her Lord. She remains
        lovingly absorbed in the pasture of the Lord, automatically embellished
        with the Word of the Shabad. With her palms pressed together,
        she prays to the Guru, to unite her with her True Beloved Lord.
        Seeing His bride's loving devotion, the Beloved Lord eradicates
        unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger. O Nanak, the young,
        innocent bride is so beautiful; seeing her Husband Lord, she is
        comforted.  || 1 ||   Truthfully, O young soul-bride, your youth
        keeps you innocent. Do not come and go anywhere; stay with your
        Husband Lord. I will stay with my Husband Lord; I am His hand-maiden.
        Devotional worship to the Lord is pleasing to me. I know the unknowable,
        and speak the unspoken; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Celestial
        Lord God. She who chants and savors the taste of the Lord's
        Name is loved by the True Lord. The Guru grants her the gift of
        the Shabad; O Nanak, she contemplates and reflects upon it.  ||
        2 ||   She who is fascinated by the Supreme Lord, sleeps with
        her Husband Lord. She walks in harmony with the Guru's
        Will, attuned to the Lord. The soul-bride is attuned to the Truth,
        and sleeps with the Lord, along with her companions and sister
        soul-brides. Loving the One Lord, with one-pointed mind, the Naam
        dwells within; I am united with the True Guru. Day and night,
        with each and every breath, I do not forget the Immaculate Lord,
        for a moment, even for an instant. So light the lamp of the Shabad,
        O Nanak, and burn away your fear.  || 3 ||   O soul-bride, the
        Lord's Light pervades all the three worlds. He is pervading
        each and every heart, the Invisible and Infinite Lord. He is Invisible
        and Infinite, Infinite and True; subduing his self-conceit, one
        meets Him. So burn away your egotistical pride, attachment and
        greed, with the Word of the Shabad; wash away your filth. When
        you go to the Lord's Door, you shall receive the Blessed
        Vision of His Darshan; by His Will, the Savior will carry you
        across and save you. Tasting the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's
        Name, the soul-bride is satisfied; O Nanak, she enshrines Him
        in her heart.  || 4 || 1 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIRST MEHL:  My mind
        is filled with such a great joy; I have blossomed forth in Truth.
        I am enticed by the love of my Husband Lord, the Eternal, Imperishable
        Lord God. The Lord is everlasting, the Master of masters. Whatever
        He wills, happens. O Great Giver, You are always kind and compassionate. <br>

      <p> You infuse life into all living beings. I have no other spiritual
        wisdom, meditation or worship; the Name of the Lord alone dwells
        deep within me. I know nothing about religious robes, pilgrimages
        or stubborn fanaticism; O Nanak, I hold tight to the Truth.  ||
        1 ||   The night is beautiful, drenched with dew, and the day
        is delightful, when her Husband Lord wakes the sleeping soul-bride,
        in the home of the self. The young bride has awakened to the Word
        of the Shabad; she is pleasing to her Husband Lord. So renounce
        falsehood, fraud, love of duality and working for people. The
        Name of the Lord is my necklace, and I am anointed with the True
        Shabad. With his palms pressed together, Nanak begs for the gift
        of the True Name; please, bless me with Your Grace, through the
        pleasure of Your Will.  || 2 ||   Awake, O bride of splendored
        eyes, and chant the Word of the Guru's Bani. Listen, and
        place your faith in the Unspoken Speech of the Lord. The Unspoken
        Speech, the state of Nirvaanaa - how rare is the Gurmukh
        who understands this. Merging in the Word of the Shabad, self-conceit
        is eradicated, and the three worlds are revealed to her understanding.
        Remaining detached, with infinity infusing, the true mind cherishes
        the virtues of the Lord. He is fully pervading and permeating
        all places; Nanak has enshrined Him within his heart.  || 3 ||
        The Lord is calling you to the Mansion of His Presence; O soul-bride,
        He is the Lover of His devotees. Following the Guru's Teachings,
        your mind shall be delighted, and your body shall be fulfilled.
        Conquer and subdue your mind, and love the Word of the Shabad;
        reform yourself, and realize the Lord of the three worlds. Her
        mind shall not waver or wander anywhere else, when she comes to
        know her Husband Lord. You are my only Support, You are my Lord
        and Master. You are my strength and anchor. She is forever truthful
        and pure, O Nanak; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        conflicts are resolved.  || 4 || 2 || <br>

        the Lord God, and I revel and delight in His Love. Very fortunate
        are those happy soul-brides, who have the jewel of the Naam upon

        The Gurmukh eradicates self-conceit, and constantly chants the
        Name of the Lord. My Lord God does whatever He pleases; the Lord
        imbues mortal beings with the color of His Love. Servant Nanak
        is easily merged into the Celestial Lord. He is satisfied with
        the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 2 ||   The Lord is found
        only through this human incarnation. This is the time to contemplate
        the Lord. As Gurmukhs, the happy soul-brides meet Him, and their
        love for Him is abundant. Those who have not attained human incarnation,
        are cursed by evil destiny. O Lord, God, Har, Har, Har, Har, save
        Nanak; he is Your humble servant.  || 3 ||   The Guru has implanted
        within me the Name of the Inaccessible Lord God; my mind and body

        attain the Lord. Without the Name of the Lord, they cannot even
        live, like the fish without water. Finding the Lord, my life has
        become fruitful; O Nanak, the Lord God has fulfilled me.  || 4
        || 1 || 3 ||   BILAAVAL,  FOURTH MEHL,  SHALOK:  Seek out the
        Lord God, your only true Friend. He shall dwell in your mind,
        by great good fortune. The True Guru shall reveal Him to you;
        O Nanak, lovingly focus yourself on the Lord.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:
        The soul-bride has come to ravish and enjoy her Lord God, after
        eradicating the poison of egotism. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, she has eliminated her self-conceit; she is lovingly
        attuned to her Lord, Har, Har. Her heart-lotus deep within has
        blossomed forth, and through the Guru, spiritual wisdom has been
        awakened within her. Servant Nanak has found the Lord God, by
        perfect, great good fortune.  || 1 ||   The Lord, the Lord God,
        is pleasing to her mind; the Lord's Name resounds within
        her. Through the Perfect Guru, God is obtained; she is lovingly
        focused on the Lord, Har, Har. The darkness of ignorance is dispelled,
        and the Divine Light radiantly shines forth. The Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, is Nanak's only Support; he merges into the
        Lord's Name.  || 2 ||   The soul-bride is ravished and
        enjoyed by her Beloved Lord God, when the Lord God is pleased
        with her. My eyes are drawn to His Love, like the cat to the mouse.
        The Perfect Guru has united me with the Lord; I am satisfied by
        the subtle essence of the Lord. Servant Nanak blossoms forth in
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he is lovingly attuned to the
        Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   I am a fool and an idiot, but the Lord
        showered me with His Mercy, and united me with Himself. Blessed,
        blessed is the most wonderful Guru, who has conquered egotism.
        Very fortunate, of blessed destiny are those, who enshrine the
        Lord, Har, Har, in their hearts. O servant Nanak, praise the Naam,
        and be a sacrifice to the Naam.  || 4 || 2 || 4 || <br>

        ecstasy resound and resonate; day and night, I am enraptured.
        Disease, sorrow and suffering do not afflict anyone there; there
        is no birth or death there. There are treasures overflowing there
        - wealth, miraculous powers, ambrosial nectar and devotional

        Lord God, the Support of the breath of life.  || 1 ||   Listen,
        O my companions, and sister soul-brides, let's join together
        and sing the songs of joy. Loving our God with mind and body,
        let's ravish and enjoy Him. Lovingly enjoying Him, we become
        pleasing to Him; let's not reject Him, for a moment, even
        for an instant. Let's hug Him close in our embrace, and
        not feel shy; let's bathe our minds in the dust of His
        feet. With the intoxicating drug of devotional worship, let's
        entice Him, and not wander anywhere else. Prays Nanak, meeting
        with our True Friend, we attain the immortal status.  || 2 ||
        I am wonder-struck and amazed, gazing upon the Glories of my
        Imperishable Lord. He took my hand, and held my arm, and cut away
        the noose of Death. Holding me by the arm, He made me His slave;
        the branch has sprouted in abundance. Pollution, attachment and
        corruption have run away; the immaculate day has dawned. Casting
        His Glance of Grace, the Lord loves me with His Mind; my immense
        evil-mindedness is dispelled. Prays Nanak, I have become immaculate
        and pure; I have met the Imperishable Lord God.  || 3 ||   The
        rays of light merge with the sun, and water merges with water.
        One's light blends with the Light, and one becomes totally
        perfect. I see God, hear God, and speak of the One and only God.
        The soul is the Creator of the expanse of creation. Without God,
        I know no other at all. He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself
        is the Enjoyer. He created the Creation. Prays Nanak, they alone
        know this, who drink in the subtle essence of the Lord.  || 4

        I am the sparrow-hawk, and You are the rain-drop; when it falls
        into my mouth, I am satisfied. When it falls into my mouth, my
        thirst is quenched; You are the Lord of my soul, my heart, my
        breath of life. Touch me, and caress me, O Lord, You are in all;
        let me meet You, so that I may be emancipated. In my consciousness

        and love. My Young Husband Lord is eternally young, and His body

        the state of eternal life.  || 2 ||   May that vicious tongue
        that does not chant the Name of the Great Lord of the World, be
        burnt. One who does not serve God, the Lover of His devotees,
        shall have his body eaten by crows. Enticed by doubt, he does
        not understand the pain it brings; he wanders through millions
        of incarnations. O Nanak, if you desire anything other than the
        Lord, you shall be consumed, like a maggot in manure.  || 3 ||
        Embrace love for the Lord God, and in detachment, unite with
        Him. Give up your sandalwood oil, expensive clothes, perfumes,
        tasty flavors and the poison of egotism. Do not waver this way
        or that, but remain wakeful in the service of the Lord. O Nanak,
        she who has obtained her God, is a happy soul-bride forever. 
        || 4 || 1 || 4 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Seek the Lord, O fortunate
        ones, and join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe forever, imbued
        with the Love of the Supreme Lord God. Serving God forever, you
        shall obtain the fruitful rewards you desire. O Nanak, seek the
        Sanctuary of God; meditate on the Lord, and ride the many waves
        of the mind.  || 1 ||   I shall not forget God, even for an instant;
        He has blessed me with everything. By great good fortune, I have
        met Him; as Gurmukh, I contemplate my Husband Lord. Holding me
        by the arm, He has lifted me up and pulled me out of the darkness,
        and made me His own. Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        Nanak lives; his mind and heart are cooled and soothed.  || 2
        ||   What virtues of Yours can I speak, O God, O Searcher of hearts?
        Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I have crossed
        over to the other shore. Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
        of the Universe, all my desires are fulfilled. Nanak is saved,
        meditating on the Lord, the Lord and Master of all.  || 3 || 
        Sublime are those eyes, which are drenched with the Love of the
        Lord. Gazing upon God, my desires are fulfilled; I have met the
        Lord, the Friend of my soul. I have obtained the Ambrosial Nectar
        of the Lord's Love, and now the taste of corruption is
        insipid and tasteless to me. O Nanak, as water mingles with water,
        my light has merged into the Light.  || 4 || 2 || 5 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> <font color="#000000">SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  I sing of the sublime
        Lord, the Lord God, in the melody of Raag Bilaaval. Hearing the
        Guru's Teachings, I obey them; this is the pre-ordained
        destiny written upon my forehead. All day and night, I chant the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har; within my heart,
        I am lovingly attuned to Him. My body and mind are totally rejuvenated,
        and the garden of my mind has blossomed forth in lush abundance.
        The darkness of ignorance has been dispelled, with the light of
        the lamp of the Guru's wisdom. Servant Nanak lives by beholding
        the Lord. Let me behold Your face, for a moment, even an instant!
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Be happy and sing in Bilaaval, when the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, is in your mouth. The melody and music,
        and the Word of the Shabad are beautiful, when one focuses his
        meditation on the celestial Lord. So leave behind the melody and
        music, and serve the Lord; then, you shall obtain honor in the
        Court of the Lord. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, contemplate God, and rid
        your mind of egotistical pride.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O Lord God,
        You Yourself are inaccessible; You formed everything. You Yourself
        are totally permeating and pervading the entire universe. You
        Yourself are absorbed in the state of deep meditation; You Yourself
        sing Your Glorious Praises. Meditate on the Lord, O devotees,
        day and night; He shall deliver you in the end. Those who serve
        the Lord, find peace; they are absorbed in the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  In the love of duality, the happiness
        of Bilaaval does not come; the self-willed manmukh finds no place
        of rest. Through hypocrisy, devotional worship does not come,
        and the Supreme Lord God is not found. By stubborn-mindedly performing
        religious rituals, no one obtains the approval of the Lord. O
        Nanak, the Gurmukh understands himself, and eradicates self-conceit
        from within. He Himself is the Supreme Lord God; the Supreme Lord
        God comes to dwell in his mind. Birth and death are erased, and
        his light blends with the Light.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Be happy
        in Bilaaval, O my beloveds, and embrace love for the One Lord.
        The pains of birth and death shall be eradicated, and you shall
        remain absorbed in the True Lord. You shall be blissful forever
        in Bilaaval, if you walk in harmony with the Will of the True
        Guru. Sitting in the Saints' Congregation, sing with love
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord forever. O Nanak, beautiful are
        those humble beings, who, as Gurmukh, are united in the Lord's
        Union.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord Himself is within all beings.
        The Lord is the friend of His devotees. Everyone is under the
        Lord's control; in the home of the devotees there is bliss.
        The Lord is the friend and companion of His devotees; all His
        humble servants stretch out and sleep in peace. The Lord is the
        Lord and Master of all; O humble devotee, remember Him. No one
        can equal You, Lord. </font><br>
