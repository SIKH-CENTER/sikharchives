      <p> Please shower Nanak with Your Mercy and bless him with peace.
        || 4 || 25 || 38 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  With Your Support,
        I survive in the Dark Age of Kali Yuga. With Your Support, I sing
        Your Glorious Praises. With Your Support, death cannot even touch
        me. With Your Support, my entanglements vanish.  || 1 ||   In
        this world and the next, I have Your Support. The One Lord, our
        Lord and Master, is all-pervading.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   With
        Your Support, I celebrate blissfully. With Your Support, I chant
        the Guru's Mantra. With Your Support, I cross over the
        terrifying world-ocean. The Perfect Lord, our Protector and Savior,
        is the Ocean of Peace.  || 2 ||   With Your Support, I have no
        fear. The True Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
        With Your Support, my mind is filled with Your Power. Here and
        there, You are my Court of Appeal.  || 3 ||   I take Your Support,
        and place my faith in You. All meditate on God, the Treasure of
        Virtue. Chanting and meditating on You, Your slaves celebrate
        in bliss. Nanak meditates in remembrance on the True Lord, the
        Treasure of Virtue.  || 4 || 26 || 39 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:
        First, I gave up slandering others. All the anxiety of my mind
        was dispelled. Greed and attachment were totally banished. I see
        God ever-present, close at hand; I have become a great devotee.
        || 1 ||   Such a renunciate is very rare. Such a humble servant
        chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I
        have forsaken my egotistical intellect. The love of sexual desire
        and anger has vanished. I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har. In the Company of the Holy, I am emancipated.
        || 2 ||   Enemy and friend are all the same to me. The Perfect
        Lord God is permeating all. Accepting the Will of God, I have
        found peace. The Perfect Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord
        within me.  || 3 ||   That person, whom the Lord, in His Mercy,
        saves - that devotee chants and meditates on the Naam.
        That person, whose mind is illumined, and who obtains understanding
        through the Guru - says Nanak, he is totally fulfilled.
        || 4 || 27 || 40 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  There is no peace
        in earning lots of money. There is no peace in watching dances
        and plays. There is no peace in conquering lots of countries.
        All peace comes from singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 1 ||   You shall obtain peace, poise and bliss,
        when you find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, by great
        good fortune. As Gurmukh, utter the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Mother, father, children and spouse -
        all place the mortal in bondage. Religious rituals and actions
        done in ego place the mortal in bondage. If the Lord, the Shatterer
        of bonds, abides in the mind, then peace is obtained, dwelling
        in the home of the self deep within.  || 2 ||   Everyone is a
        beggar; God is the Great Giver. The Treasure of Virtue is the
        Infinite, Endless Lord. That person, unto whom God grants His
        Mercy - that humble being chants the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 3 ||   I offer my prayer to my Guru. O Primal Lord
        God, Treasure of Virtue, please bless me with Your Grace. Says
        Nanak, I have come to Your Sanctuary. If it pleases You, please
        protect me, O Lord of the World.  || 4 || 28 || 41 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Meeting with the Guru, I have forsaken the love
        of duality. <br>

      <p> As Gurmukh, I chant the Name of the Lord. My anxiety is gone,
        and I am in love with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I was asleep
        for countless lifetimes, but I have now awakened.  || 1 ||   Granting
        His Grace, He has linked me to His service. In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, all pleasures are found.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Word of the Guru's Shabad has eradicated disease
        and evil. My mind has absorbed the medicine of the Naam. Meeting
        with the Guru, my mind is in bliss. All treasures are in the Name
        of the Lord God.  || 2 ||   My fear of birth and death and the
        Messenger of Death has been dispelled. In the Saadh Sangat, the
        inverted lotus of my heart has blossomed forth. Singing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, I have found eternal, abiding peace. All
        my tasks are perfectly accomplished.  || 3 ||   This human body,
        so difficult to obtain, is approved by the Lord. Chanting the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, it has become fruitful. Says Nanak,
        God has blessed me with His Mercy. With every breath and morsel
        of food, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4 || 29 || 42 ||
        BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  His Name is the Highest of all. Sing
        His Glorious Praises, forever and ever. Meditating in remembrance
        on Him, all pain is dispelled. All pleasures come to dwell in
        the mind.  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate in remembrance on the
        True Lord. In this world and the next, you shall be saved.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Immaculate Lord God is the Creator of all.
        He gives sustenance to all beings and creatures. He forgives millions
        of sins and mistakes in an instant. Through loving devotional
        worship, one is emancipated forever.  || 2 ||   True wealth and
        true glorious greatness, and eternal, unchanging wisdom, are obtained
        from the Perfect Guru. When the Protector, the Savior Lord, bestows
        His Mercy, all spiritual darkness is dispelled.  || 3 ||   I focus
        my meditation on the Supreme Lord God. The Lord of Nirvaanaa is
        totally pervading and permeating all. Eradicating doubt and fear,
        I have met the Lord of the World. The Guru has become merciful
        to Nanak.  || 4 || 30 || 43 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating
        in remembrance on Him, the mind is illumined. Suffering is eradicated,
        and one comes to dwell in peace and poise. They alone receive
        it, unto whom God gives it. They are blessed to serve the Perfect
        Guru.  || 1 ||   All peace and comfort are in Your Name, God.
        Twenty-four hours a day, O my mind, sing His Glorious Praises.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You shall receive the fruits of your desires,
        when the Name of the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. Meditating
        on the Lord, your comings and goings cease. Through loving devotional
        worship, lovingly focus your attention on God.  || 2 ||   Sexual
        desire, anger and egotism are dispelled. Love and attachment to
        Maya are broken. Lean on God's Support, day and night.
        The Supreme Lord God has given this gift.  || 3 ||   Our Lord
        and Master is the Creator, the Cause of causes. He is the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of all hearts. Bless me with Your Grace, Lord, and
        link me to Your service. Slave Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary.
        || 4 || 31 || 44 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who does not
        repeat the Naam, the Name of the Lord, shall die of shame. Without
        the Name, how can he ever sleep in peace? <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p> The mortal abandons meditative remembrance of the Lord, and then
        wishes for the state of supreme salvation; but without roots,
        how can there be any branches?  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate
        on the Guru, the Lord of the Universe. The filth of countless
        incarnations shall be washed away. Breaking your bonds, you shall
        be united with the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   How can a stone
        be purified by bathing at a sacred shrine of pilgrimage? The filth
        of egotism clings to the mind. Millions of rituals and actions
        taken are the root of entanglements. Without meditating and vibrating
        on the Lord, the mortal gathers only worthless bundles of straw.
        || 2 ||   Without eating, hunger is not satisfied. When the disease
        is cured, then the pain goes away. The mortal is engrossed in
        sexual desire, anger, greed and attachment. He does not meditate
        on God, that God who created him.  || 3 ||   Blessed, blessed
        is the Holy Saint, and blessed is the Name of the Lord. Twenty-four
        hours a day, sing the Kirtan, the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        Blessed is the devotee of the Lord, and blessed is the Creator
        Lord. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the Primal, the Infinite.
        || 4 || 32 || 45 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  When the Guru was
        totally pleased, my fear was taken away. I enshrine the Name of
        the Immaculate Lord within my mind. He is Merciful to the meek,
        forever Compassionate. All my entanglements are finished.  ||
        1 ||   I have found peace, poise, and myriads of pleasures. In
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, fear and doubt are
        dispelled. My tongue chants the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have fallen in love with the Lord's
        Lotus Feet. In an instant, the terrible demons are destroyed.
        Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate and chant the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har. The Guru is Himself the Savior Lord, the Lord
        of the Universe.  || 2 ||   He Himself cherishes His servant forever.
        He watches over every breath of His humble devotee. Tell me, what
        is the nature of human beings? The Lord extends His Hand, and
        saves them from the Messenger of Death.  || 3 ||   Immaculate
        is the Glory, and Immaculate is the way of life, of those who
        remember the Supreme Lord God in their minds. The Guru, in His
        Mercy, has granted this Gift. Nanak has obtained the treasure
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 33 || 46 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  My Guru is the All-powerful Lord, the Creator, the
        Cause of causes. He is the Soul, the Breath of Life, the Giver
        of Peace, always near. He is the Destroyer of fear, the Eternal,
        Unchanging, Sovereign Lord King. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision
        of His Darshan, all fear is dispelled.  || 1 ||   Wherever I look,
        is the Protection of Your Sanctuary. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice
        to the Feet of the True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My tasks are
        perfectly accomplished, meeting the Divine Guru. He is the Giver
        of all rewards. Serving Him, I am immaculate. He reaches out with
        His Hand to His slaves. The Name of the Lord abides in their hearts.
        || 2 ||   They are forever in bliss, and do not suffer at all.
        No pain, sorrow or disease afflicts them. Everything is Yours,
        O Creator Lord. The Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Inaccessible
        and Infinite.  || 3 ||   His Glorious Grandeur is immaculate,
        and the Bani of His Word is wonderful! The Perfect Supreme Lord
        God is pleasing to my mind. He is permeating the waters, the lands
        and the skies. O Nanak, everything comes from God.  || 4 || 34
        || 47 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  My mind and body are imbued
        with the Love of the Lord's Feet. <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p> All the desires of my mind have been perfectly fulfilled. Twenty-four
        hours a day, I sing of the Lord God. The True Guru has imparted
        this perfect wisdom.  || 1 ||   Very fortunate are those who love
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Associating with them, we cross
        over the world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They are spiritual
        teachers, who meditate in remembrance on the One Lord. Wealthy
        are those who have a discriminating intellect. Noble are those
        who remember their Lord and Master in meditation. Honorable are
        those who understand their own selves.  || 2 ||   By Guru's
        Grace, I have obtained the supreme status. Day and night I meditate
        on the Glories of God. My bonds are broken, and my hopes are fulfilled.
        The Feet of the Lord now abide in my heart.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak,
        one whose karma is perfect - that humble being enters the
        Sanctuary of God. He himself is pure, and he sanctifies all. His
        tongue chants the Name of the Lord, the Source of Nectar.  ||
        4 || 35 || 48 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  Repeating the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, no obstacles block the way. Listening to
        the Naam, the Messenger of Death runs far away. Repeating the
        Naam, all pains vanish. Chanting the Naam, the Lord's Lotus
        Feet dwell within.  || 1 ||   Meditating, vibrating the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, is unobstructed devotional worship. Sing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord with loving affection and energy.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the
        Eye of Death cannot see you. Meditating in remembrance on the
        Lord, demons and ghosts shall not touch you. Meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord, attachment and pride shall not bind you. Meditating
        in remembrance on the Lord, you shall not be consigned to the
        womb of reincarnation.  || 2 ||   Any time is a good time to meditate
        in remembrance on the Lord. Among the masses, only a few meditate
        in remembrance on the Lord. Social class or no social class, anyone
        may meditate on the Lord. Whoever meditates on Him is emancipated.
        || 3 ||   Chant the Name of the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy. Perfect is the Love of the Lord's
        Name. O God, shower Your Mercy on Nanak, that he may think of
        you with each and every breath.  || 4 || 36 || 49 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  He Himself is the Shaastras, and He Himself is the
        Vedas. He knows the secrets of each and every heart. He is the
        Embodiment of Light; all beings belong to Him. The Creator, the
        Cause of causes, the Perfect All-powerful Lord.  || 1 ||   Grab
        hold of the Support of God, O my mind. As Gurmukh, worship and
        adore His Lotus Feet; enemies and pains shall not even approach
        you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself is the Essence of the forests
        and fields, and all the three worlds. The universe is strung on
        His Thread. He is the Uniter of Shiva and Shakti - mind
        and matter. He Himself is in the detachment of Nirvaanaa, and
        He Himself is the Enjoyer.  || 2 ||   Wherever I look, there He
        is. Without Him, there is no one at all. In the Love of the Naam,
        the world-ocean is crossed. Nanak sings His Glorious Praises in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 3 ||   Liberation,
        the ways and means of enjoyment and union are under His Control.
        His humble servant lacks nothing. That person, with whom the Lord,
        in His Mercy, is pleased - O slave Nanak, that humble servant
        is blessed.  || 4 || 37 || 50 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        minds of the Lord's devotee are filled with bliss. <br>

      <p> They become stable and permanent, and all their anxiety is gone.
        Their fears and doubts are dispelled in an instant. The Supreme
        Lord God comes to dwell in their minds.  || 1 ||   The Lord is
        forever the Help and Support of the Saints. Inside the home of
        the heart, and outside as well, the Transcendent Lord is always
        with us, permeating and pervading all places.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Lord of the World is my wealth, property, youth and
        ways and means. He continually cherishes and brings peace to my
        soul and breath of life. He reaches out with His Hand and saves
        His slave. He does not abandon us, even for an instant; He is
        always with us.  || 2 ||   There is no other Beloved like the
        Lord. The True Lord takes care of all. The Lord is our Mother,
        Father, Son and Relation. Since the beginning of time, and throughout
        the ages, His devotees sing His Glorious Praises.  || 3 ||   My
        mind is filled with the Support and the Power of the Lord. Without
        the Lord, there is no other at all. Nanak's mind is encouraged
        by this hope, that God will accomplish my objectives in life.
        || 4 || 38 || 51 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  Fear itself becomes
        afraid, when the mortal remembers the Lord's Name in meditation.
        All the diseases of the three gunas - the three qualities
        - are cured, and tasks of the Lord's slaves are
        perfectly accomplished.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The people of the
        Lord always sing His Glorious Praises; they attain His Perfect
        Mansion. Even the Righteous Judge of Dharma and the Messenger
        of Death yearn, day and night, to be sanctified by the Blessed
        Vision of the Lord's humble servant.  || 1 ||   Sexual
        desire, anger, intoxication, egotism, slander and egotistical
        pride are eradicted in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
        By great good fortune, such Saints are met. Nanak is forever a
        sacrifice to them.  || 2 || 39 || 52 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:
        One who harbors the five thieves, becomes the embodiment of these
        five. He gets up each day and tells lies. He applies ceremonial
        religious marks to his body, but practices hypocrisy. He wastes
        away in sadness and pain, like a lonely widow.  || 1 ||   Without
        the Name of the Lord, everything is false. Without the Perfect
        Guru, liberation is not obtained. In the Court of the True Lord,
        the faithless cynic is plundered.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who
        does not know the Lord's Creative Power is polluted. Ritualistically
        plastering one's kitchen square does not make it pure in
        the Eyes of the Lord. If a person is polluted within, he may wash
        himself everyday on the outside, but in the Court of the True
        Lord, he forfeits his honor.  || 2 ||   He works for the sake
        of Maya, but he never places his feet on the right path. He never
        even remembers the One who created him. He speaks falsehood, only
        falsehood, with his mouth.  || 3 ||   That person, unto whom the
        Creator Lord shows Mercy, deals with the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy. One who lovingly worships the Lord's Name,
        says Nanak - no obstacles ever block his way.  || 4 ||
        40 || 53 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  The entire universe curses
        the slanderer. False are the dealings of the slanderer. The slanderer's
        lifestyle is filthy and polluted. The Lord is the Saving Grace
        and the Protector of His slave.  || 1 ||   The slanderer dies
        with the rest of the slanderers. <br>

        His humble servant. Death roars and thunders over the head of
        the slanderer.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   No one belives what the slanderer
        says. The slanderer tells lies, and later regrets and repents.
        He wrings his hands, and hits his head against the ground. The
        Lord does not forgive the slanderer.  || 2 ||   The Lord's
        slave does not wish anyone ill. The slanderer suffers, as if stabbed
        by a spear. Like a crane, he spreads his feathers, to look like
        a swan. When he speaks with his mouth, then he is exposed and
        driven out.  || 3 ||   The Creator is the Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts. That person, whom the Lord makes His Own, becomes stable
        and steady. The Lord's slave is true in the Court of the
        Lord. Servant Nanak speaks, after contemplating the essence of
        reality.  || 4 || 41 || 54 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  With my
        palms pressed together, I offer this prayer. My soul, body and
        wealth are His property. He is the Creator, my Lord and Master.
        Millions of times, I am a sacrifice to Him.  || 1 ||   The dust
        of the feet of the Holy brings purity. Remembering God in meditation,
        the mind's corruption is eradicated, and the filth of countless
        incarnations is washed away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All treasures
        are in His household. Serving Him, the mortal attains honor. He
        is the Fulfiller of the mind's desires. He is the Support
        of the soul and the breath of life of His devotees.  || 2 || 
        His Light shines in each and every heart. Chanting and meditating
        on God, the Treasure of Virtue, His devotees live. Service to
        Him does not go in vain. Deep within your mind and body, meditate
        on the One Lord.  || 3 ||   Following the Guru's Teachings,
        compassion and contentment are found. This Treasure of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, is the immaculate object. Please grant Your
        Grace, O Lord, and attach me to the hem of Your robe. Nanak meditates
        continually on the Lord's Lotus Feet.  || 4 || 42 || 55
        ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  The True Guru has listened to my prayer.
        All my affairs have been resolved. Deep within my mind and body,
        I meditate on God. The Perfect Guru has dispelled all my fears.
        || 1 ||   The All-powerful Divine Guru is the Greatest of all.
        Serving Him, I obtain all comforts.  ||  Pause  ||   Everything
        is done by Him. No one can erase His Eternal Decree. The Supreme
        Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, is incomparably beautiful. The
        Guru is the Image of Fulfillment, the Embodiment of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   The Name of the Lord abides deep within him. Wherever
        he looks, he sees the Wisdom of God. His mind is totally enlightened
        and illuminated. Within that person, the Supreme Lord God abides.
        || 3 ||   I humbly bow to that Guru forever. I am forever a sacrifice
        to that Guru. I wash the feet of the Guru, and drink in this water.
        Chanting and meditating forever on Guru Nanak, I live.  || 4 ||

      <p> <font color="#000000">The Lord is in the soul, and the soul is in
        the Lord. This is realized through the Guru's Teachings.
        The Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani is realized through
        the Word of the Shabad. Sorrow is dispelled, and egotism is eliminated.
        || 1 ||   O Nanak, the disease of egotism is so very deadly.
        Wherever I look, I see the pain of the same disease. The Primal
        Lord Himself bestows the Shabad of His Word.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   When the Appraiser Himself appraises the mortal, then he
        is not tested again. Those who are blessed with His Grace meet
        with the Guru. They alone are true, who are pleasing to God. 
        || 2 ||   Air, water and fire are diseased; the world with its
        enjoyments is diseased. Mother, father, Maya and the body are
        diseased; those united with their relatives are diseased.  ||
        3 ||   Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are diseased; the whole world
        is diseased. Those who remember the Lord's Feet and contemplate
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad are liberated.  || 4 || 
        The seven seas are diseased, along with the rivers; the continents
        and the nether regions of the underworlds are full of disease.
        The people of the Lord dwell in Truth and peace; He blesses them
        with His Grace everywhere.  || 5 ||   The six Shaastras are diseased,
        as are the many who follow the different religious orders. What
        can the poor Vedas and Bibles do? People do not understand the
        One and Only Lord.  || 6 ||   Eating sweet treats, the mortal
        is filled with disease; he finds no peace at all. Forgetting the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, they walk on other paths, and at the
        very last moment, they regret and repent.  || 7 ||   Wandering
        around at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, the mortal is not cured
        of his disease. Reading scripture, he gets involved in useless
        arguments. The disease of duality is so very deadly; it causes
        dependence on Maya.  || 8 ||   One who becomes Gurmukh and praises
        the True Shabad with the True Lord in his mind is cured of his
        disease. <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The Creator has staged His Wondrous Play.
        I listen to the Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad, and the
        Bani of His Word. The self-willed manmukhs are deluded and confused,
        while the Gurmukhs understand. The Creator creates the Cause that
        causes.  || 1 ||   Deep within my being, I meditate on the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad. I shall never forsake the Name of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Prahlaad's father sent
        him to school, to learn to read. He took his writing tablet and
        went to the teacher. He said, &quot;I shall not read anything
        except the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Write the Lord's
        Name on my tablet.&quot;  || 2 ||   Prahlaad's mother
        said to her son, &quot;I advise you not to read anything except
        what you are taught.&quot; He answered, &quot;The Great Giver,
        my Fearless Lord God is always with me. If I were to forsake the
        Lord, then my family would be disgraced.&quot;  || 3 ||   &quot;Prahlaad
        has corrupted all the other students. He does not listen to what
        I say, and he does his own thing. He instigated devotional worship
        in the townspeople.&quot; The gathering of the wicked people
        could not do anything against him.  || 4 ||   Sanda and Marka,
        his teachers, made the complaint. All the demons kept trying in
        vain. The Lord protected His humble devotee, and preserved his
        honor. What can be done by mere created beings?  || 5 ||   Because
        of his past karma, the demon ruled over his kingdom. He did not
        realize the Lord; the Lord Himself confused him. He started an
        argument with his son Prahlaad. The blind one did not understand
        that his death was approaching.  || 6 ||   Prahlaad was placed
        in a cell, and the door was locked. The fearless child was not
        afraid at all. He said, &quot;Within my being, is the Guru,
        the Lord of the World.&quot; The created being tried to compete
        with his Creator, but he assumed this name in vain. That which
        was predestined for him has come to pass; he started an argument
        with the Lord's humble servant.  || 7 ||   The father raised
        the club to strike down Prahlaad, saying, &quot;Where is your
        God, the Lord of the Universe, now?&quot; He replied, &quot;The
        Life of the World, the Great Giver, is my Help and Support in
        the end. Wherever I look, I see Him permeating and prevailing.&quot;
        || 8 ||   Tearing down the pillars, the Lord Himself appeared.
        The egotistical demon was killed and destroyed. The minds of the
        devotees were filled with bliss, and congratulations poured in.
        He blessed His servant with glorious greatness.  || 9 ||   He
        created birth, death and attachment. The Creator has ordained
        coming and going in reincarnation. For the sake of Prahlaad, the
        Lord Himself appeared. The word of the devotee came true.  ||
        10 ||   The gods proclaimed the victory of Lakshmi, and said,
  &quot;O mother, make this form of the Man-lion disappear!&quot; <br>

      <p> Lakshmi was afraid, and did not approach. The humble servant Prahlaad
        came and fell at the Lord's Feet.  || 11 ||   The True
        Guru implanted the treasure of the Naam within. Power, property
        and all Maya is false. But still, the greedy people continue clinging
        to them. Without the Name of the Lord, the mortals are punished
        in His Court.  || 12 ||   Says Nanak, everyone acts as the Lord
        makes them act. They alone are approved and accepted, who focus
        their consciousness on the Lord. He has made His devotees His
        Own. The Creator has appeared in His Own Form.  || 13 || 1 ||
        2 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  Serving the Guru, I obtain the Ambrosial
        Fruit; my egotism and desire have been quenched. The Name of the
        Lord dwells within my heart and mind, and the desires of my mind
        are quieted.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, my Beloved, please bless
        me with Your Mercy. Night and day, Your humble servant begs for
        Your Glorious Praises; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        he is saved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Messenger of Death cannot
        even touch the humble Saints; it does not cause them even an iota
        of suffering or pain. Those who enter Your Sanctuary, Lord, save
        themselves, and save all their ancestors as well.  || 2 ||   You
        Yourself save the honor of Your devotees; this is Your Glory,
        O Lord. You cleanse them of the sinful residues and the pains
        of countless incarnations; You love them without even an iota
        of duality.  || 3 ||   I am foolish and ignorant, and understand
        nothing. You Yourself bless me with understanding. You do whatever
        You please; nothing else can be done at all.  || 4 ||   Creating
        the world, You have linked all to their tasks - even the
        evil deeds which men do. They lose this precious human life in
        the gamble, and do not understand the Word of the Shabad.  ||
        5 ||   The self-willed manmukhs die, understanding nothing; they
        are enveloped by the darkness of evil-mindedness and ignorance.
        They do not cross over the terrible world-ocean; without the Guru,
        they drown and die.  || 6 ||   True are those humble beings who
        are imbued with the True Shabad; the Lord God unites them with
        Himself. Through the Word of the Guru's Bani, they come
        to understand the Shabad. They remain lovingly focused on the
        True Lord.  || 7 ||   You Yourself are Immaculate and Pure, and
        pure are Your humble servants who contemplate the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those, who
        enshrine the Lord's Name within their hearts.  || 8 ||

      <p> Millions of austere penitents practice austerities. Millions of
        silent sages dwell in silence.  || 7 ||   Our Eternal, Imperishable,
        Incomprehensible Lord and Master, the Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts, is permeating all hearts. Wherever I look, I see Your
        Dwelling, O Lord. The Guru has blessed Nanak with enlightenment.
        || 8 || 2 || 5 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  The True Guru has
        blessed me with this gift. He has given me the Priceless Jewel
        of the Lord's Name. Now, I intuitively enjoy endless pleasures
        and wondrous play. God has spontaneously met with Nanak.  || 1
        ||   Says Nanak, True is the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise.
        Again and again, my mind remains immersed in it.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Spontaneously, I feed on the Love of God. Spontaneously,
        I take God's Name. Spontaneously, I am saved by the Word
        of the Shabad. Spontaneously, my treasures are filled to overflowing.
        || 2 ||   Spontaneously, my works are perfectly accomplished.
        Spontaneously, I am rid of sorrow. Spontaneously, my enemies have
        become friends. Spontaneously, I have brought my mind under control.
        Spontaneously, God has comforted me.  || 3 ||   Spontaneously,
        my hopes have been fulfilled. Spontaneously, I have totally realized
        the essence of reality. Spontaneously, I have been blessed with
        the Guru's Mantra.  || 4 ||   Spontaneously, I am rid of
        hatred. Spontaneously, my darkness has been dispelled. Spontaneously,
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise seems so sweet to my mind.
        Spontaneously, I behold God in each and every heart.  || 5 ||
        Spontaneously, all my doubts have been dispelled. Spontaneously,
        peace and celestial harmony fill my mind. Spontaneously, the Unstruck
        Melody of the Sound-current resounds within me. Spontaneously,
        the Lord of the Universe has revealed Himself to me.  || 6 ||
        Spontaneously, my mind has been pleased and appeased. I have
        spontaneously realized the Eternal, Unchanging Lord. Spontaneously,
        all wisdom and knowledge has welled up within me. Spontaneously,
        the Support of the Lord, Har, Har, has come into my hands.  ||
        7 ||   Spontaneously, God has recorded my pre-ordained destiny.
        Spontaneously, the One Lord and Master God has met me. Spontaneously,
        all my cares and worries have been taken away. Nanak, Nanak, Nanak,
        has merged into the Image of God.  || 8 || 3 || 6 || <br>
