      <p> <font color="#000000">Listen, O mind, to the Unspoken Speech of
        the Lord's Name. Riches, wisdom, supernatural spiritual
        powers and peace are obtained, by vibrating, meditating on the
        Lord God, under Guru's Instruction.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Numerous legends, the Puraanas, and the six Shaastras, sing
        the sublime Praises of the Lord. Shiva and the thirty-three million
        gods meditate on the Lord, but they do not know the secret of
        His mystery.  || 1 ||   The angelic and divine beings, and the
        celestial singers sing His Praises; all Creation sings of Him.
        O Nanak, those whom the Lord blesses with His Kind Mercy, become
        the good Saints of the Lord God.  || 2 || 1 ||   BAIRAAREE,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  O mind, those who meet the Lord's humble servants,
        sing His Praises. They are blessed with the gift of the jewel
        of the Lord, Har, Har, the sublime jewel of the Lord, by the Guru,
        the True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I offer my mind, body and
        everything to that humble being who recites the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har. I offer my wealth, the riches of Maya and my property
        to that one who leads me to meet the Lord, my friend.  || 1 ||
        When the Lord of the world bestowed just a tiny bit of His Mercy,
        for just an instant, then I meditated on the Praise of the Lord,
        Har, Har, Har. The Lord and Master has met servant Nanak, and
        the pain of the sickness of egotism has been eliminated.  || 2
        || 2 ||   BAIRAAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord's humble servant
        sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name. Even if
        someone slanders the Lord's humble servant, he does not
        give up his own goodness.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever the Lord
        and Master does, He does by Himself; the Lord Himself does the
        deeds. <br>

      <p> The Lord and Master Himself imparts understanding; the Lord Himself
        inspires us to speak.  || 1 ||   The Lord Himself directs the
        evolution of the world of the five elements; He Himself infuses
        the five senses into it. O servant Nanak, the Lord Himself unites
        us with the True Guru; He Himself resolves the conflicts.  ||
        2 || 3 ||   BAIRAAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  Chant the Name of the Lord,
        O mind, and you shall be emancipated. The Lord shall destroy all
        the sins of millions upon millions of incarnations, and carry
        you across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In
        the body-village, the Lord Master abides; the Lord is without
        fear, without vengeance, and without form. The Lord is dwelling
        near at hand, but He cannot be seen. By the Guru's Teachings,
        the Lord is obtained.  || 1 ||   The Lord Himself is the banker,
        the jeweller, the jewel, the gem; the Lord Himself created the
        entire expanse of the creation. O Nanak, one who is blessed by
        the Lord's Kind Mercy, trades in the Lord's Name;
        He alone is the true banker, the true trader.  || 2 || 4 ||  
        BAIRAAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  Meditate, O mind, on the immaculate,
        formless Lord. Forever and ever, meditate on the Lord, the Giver
        of peace; He has no end or limitation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In
        the fiery pit of the womb, when you were hanging upside-down,
        the Lord absorbed You in His Love, and preserved You. So serve
        such a Lord, O my mind; the Lord shall deliver you in the end.
        || 1 ||   Bow down in reverence to that humble being, within
        whose heart the Lord, Har, Har, abides. By the Lord's Kind
        Mercy, O Nanak, one obtains the Lord's meditation, and
        the support of the Naam.  || 2 || 5 ||   BAIRAAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:
        O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; meditate on
        it continually. You shall obtain the fruits of your heart's
        desires, and pain shall never touch you again.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   That is chanting, that is deep meditation and austerity,
        that is fasting and worship, which inspires love for the Lord.
        Without the Lord's Love, every other love is false; in
        an instant, it is all forgotten.  || 1 ||   You are infinite,
        the Master of all power; Your value cannot be described at all.
        Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary, O Dear Lord; as it pleases You,
        save him.  || 2 || 6 || <br>

        obtain. By His Kind Mercy, the Lord blesses us with His Name.
        || 1 ||   All happiness and greatness are in the Lord's
        Name. By Guru's Grace, Nanak has gained this understanding.
