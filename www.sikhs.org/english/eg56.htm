        <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.</b>
        <p> <b>TRUTH IS THE NAME.</b> </p>
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  NO FEAR.  NO HATRED. </p>
        <p> IMAGE OF THE UNDYING.  BEYOND BIRTH.  SELF-EXISTENT. </p>
        <p> BY GURU'S GRACE: </p>
        <p> SORAT'H, FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  CHAU-PADAS:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Death comes to all, and all must suffer separation. Go and ask
        the clever people, whether they shall meet in the world hereafter.
        Those who forget my Lord and Master shall suffer in terrible pain.
        || 1 ||   So praise the True Lord, by whose Grace peace ever
        prevails.  ||  Pause  ||   Praise Him as great; He is, and He
        shall ever be. You alone are the Great Giver; mankind cannot give
        anything. Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass; what good does
        it do to cry out in protest?  || 2 ||   Many have proclaimed their
        sovereignty over millions of fortresses on the earth, but they
        have now departed. And those, whom even the sky could not contain,
        had ropes put through their noses. O mind, if you only knew the
        torment in your future, you would not relish the sweet pleasures
        of the present.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, as many as are the sins one
        commits, so many are the chains around his neck. If he possesses
        virtues, then the chains are cut away; these virtues are his brothers,
        his true brothers. Going to the world hereafter, those who have
        no Guru are not accepted; they are beaten, and expelled.  || 4
        || 1 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:  Make your
        mind the farmer, good deeds the farm, modesty the water, and your
        body the field. Let the Lord's Name be the seed, contentment
        the plow, and your humble dress the fence. Doing deeds of love,
        the seed shall sprout, and you shall see your home flourish. 
        || 1 ||   O Baba, the wealth of Maya does not go with anyone.
        This Maya has bewitched the world, but only a rare few understand
        this.  ||  Pause  ||   Make your ever-decreasing life your shop,
        and make the Lord's Name your merchandise. Make understanding
        and contemplation your warehouse, and in that warehouse, store
        the Lord's Name. Deal with the Lord's dealers, earn
        your profits, and rejoice in your mind.  || 2 ||   Let your trade
        be listening to scripture, and let Truth be the horses you take
        to sell. Gather up merits for your travelling expenses, and do
        not think of tomorrow in your mind. When you arrive in the land
        of the Formless Lord, you shall find peace in the Mansion of His
        Presence.  || 3 ||   Let your service be the focusing of your
        consciousness, and let your occupation be the placing of faith
        in the Naam. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Let your work be restraint from sin; only then will people call
        you blessed. O Nanak, the Lord shall look upon you with His Glance
        of Grace, and you shall be blessed with honor four times over.
        || 4 || 2 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL,  CHAU-TUKAS:  The son
        is dear to his mother and father; he is the wise son-in-law to
        his father-in-law. The father is dear to his son and daughter,
        and the brother is very dear to his brother. By the Order of the
        Lord's Command, he leaves his house and goes outside, and
        in an instant, everything becomes alien to him. The self-willed
        manmukh does not remember the Name of the Lord, does not give
        in charity, and does not cleanse his consciousness; his body rolls
        in the dust.  || 1 ||   The mind is comforted by the Comforter
        of the Naam. I fall at the Guru's feet  -  I am a sacrifice
        to Him; He has given me to understand the true understanding.
        ||  Pause  ||   The mind is impressed with the false love of
        the world; he quarrels with the Lord's humble servant. Infatuated
        with Maya, night and day, he sees only the worldly path; he does
        not chant the Naam, and drinking poison, he dies. He is imbued
        and infatuated with vicious talk; the Word of the Shabad does
        not come into his consciousness. He is not imbued with the Lord's
        Love, and he is not impressed by the taste of the Name; the self-willed
        manmukh loses his honor.  || 2 ||   He does not enjoy celestial
        peace in the Company of the Holy, and there is not even a bit
        of sweetness on his tongue. He calls his mind, body and wealth
        his own; he has no knowledge of the Court of the Lord. Closing
        his eyes, he walks in darkness; he cannot see the home of his
        own being, O Siblings of Destiny. Tied up at Death's door,
        he finds no place of rest; he receives the rewards of his own
        actions.  || 3 ||   When the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then
        I see Him with my own eyes; He is indescribable, and cannot be
        described. With my ears, I continually listen to the Word of the
        Shabad, and I praise Him; His Ambrosial Name abides within my
        heart. He is Fearless, Formless and absolutely without vengeance;
        I am absorbed in His Perfect Light. O Nanak, without the Guru,
        doubt is not dispelled; through the True Name, glorious greatness
        is obtained.  || 4 || 3 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL,  DU-TUKAS:
        In the realm of land, and in the realm of water, Your seat is
        the chamber of the four directions. Yours is the one and only
        form of the entire universe; Your mouth is the mint to fashion
        all.  || 1 ||   O my Lord Master, Your play is so wonderful! You
        are pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky;
        You Yourself are contained in all.  ||  Pause  ||   Wherever I
        look, there I see Your Light, but what is Your form? You have
        one form, but it is unseen; there is none like any other.  ||
        2 ||   The beings born of eggs, born of the womb, born of the
        earth and born of sweat, all are created by You. I have seen one
        glory of Yours, that You are pervading and permeating in all.
        || 3 ||   Your Glories are so numerous, and I do not know even
        one of them; I am such a fool  -  please, give me some of them!
        Prays Nanak, listen, O my Lord Master: I am sinking like a stone
        -  please, save me!  || 4 || 4 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL:
        I am a wicked sinner and a great hypocrite; You are the Immaculate
        and Formless Lord. Tasting the Ambrosial Nectar, I am imbued with
        supreme bliss; O Lord and Master, I seek Your Sanctuary.  || 1
        ||   O Creator Lord, You are the honor of the dishonored. In my
        lap is the honor and glory of the wealth of the Name; I merge
        into the True Word of the Shabad.  ||  Pause  || </p>
      <p>

          <br>
          <b><a name="p597" id="p597">Page 597</a></b>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> You are perfect, while I am worthless and imperfect. You are profound,
        while I am trivial. My mind is imbued with You, day and night
        and morning, O Lord; my tongue chants Your Name, and my mind meditates
        on You.  || 2 ||   You are True, and I am absorbed into You; through
        the mystery of the Shabad, I shall ultimately become True as well.
        Those who are imbued with the Naam day and night are pure, while
        those who die to be reborn are impure.  || 3 ||   I do not see
        any other like the Lord; who else should I praise? No one is equal
        to Him. Prays Nanak, I am the slave of His slaves; by Guru's
        Instruction, I know Him.  || 4 || 5 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST
        MEHL:  He is unknowable, infinite, unapproachable and imperceptible.
        He is not subject to death or karma. His caste is casteless; He
        is unborn, self-illumined, and free of doubt and desire.  || 1
        ||   I am a sacrifice to the Truest of the True. He has no form,
        no color and no features; through the True Word of the Shabad,
        He reveals Himself.  ||  Pause  ||   He has no mother, father,
        sons or relatives; He is free of sexual desire; He has no wife.
        He has no ancestry; He is immaculate. He is infinite and endless;
        O Lord, Your Light is pervading all.  || 2 ||   Deep within each
        and every heart, God is hidden; His Light is in each and every
        heart. The heavy doors are opened by Guru's Instructions;
        one becomes fearless, in the trance of deep meditation.  || 3
        ||   The Lord created all beings, and placed death over the heads
        of all; all the world is under His Power. Serving the True Guru,
        the treasure is obtained; living the Word of the Shabad, one is
        emancipated.  || 4 ||   In the pure vessel, the True Name is contained;
        how few are those who practice true conduct. The individual soul
        is united with the Supreme Soul; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord.
        || 5 || 6 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL:  Like a fish without
        water is the faithless cynic, who dies of thirst. So shall you
        die, O mind, without the Lord, as your breath goes in vain.  ||
        1 ||   O mind, chant the Lord's Name, and praise Him. Without
        the Guru, how will you obtain this juice? The Guru shall unite
        you with the Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   For the Gurmukh, meeting with
        the Society of the Saints is like making a pilgrimage to a sacred
        shrine. The benefit of bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage is obtained by the Blessed Vision of the Guru's
        Darshan.  || 2 ||   Like the Yogi without abstinence, and like
        penance without truth and contentment, so is the body without
        the Lord's Name; death will slay it, because of the sin within.
        || 3 ||   The faithless cynic does not obtain the Lord's
        Love; the Lord's Love is obtained only through the True Guru.
        One who meets with the Guru, the Giver of pleasure and pain, says
        Nanak, is absorbed in the Lord's Praise.  || 4 || 7 ||  
        SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL:  You, God, are the Giver of gifts,
        the Lord of perfect understanding; I am a mere beggar at Your
        Door. What should I beg for? Nothing remains permanent; O Lord,
        please, bless me with Your Beloved Name.  || 1 ||   In each and
        every heart, the Lord, the Lord of the forest, is permeating and
        pervading. In the water, on the land, and in the sky, He is pervading
        but hidden; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is
        revealed.  ||  Pause  ||   In this world, in the nether regions
        of the underworld, and in the Akaashic Ethers, the Guru, the True
        Guru, has shown me the Lord; He has showered me with His Mercy.
        He is the unborn Lord God; He is, and shall ever be. </p>

      <p> Deep within your heart, behold Him, the Destroyer of ego.  ||
        2 ||   This wretched world is caught in birth and death; in the
        love of duality, it has forgotten devotional worship of the Lord.
        Meeting the True Guru, the Guru's Teachings are obtained;
        the faithless cynic loses the game of life.  || 3 ||   Breaking
        my bonds, the True Guru has set me free, and I shall not be cast
        into the womb of reincarnation again. O Nanak, the jewel of spiritual
        wisdom shines forth, and the Lord, the Formless Lord, dwells within
        my mind.  || 4 || 8 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL:  The treasure
        of the Name, for which you have come into the world  -  that
        Ambrosial Nectar is with the Guru. Renounce costumes, disguises
        and clever tricks; this fruit is not obtained by duplicity.  ||
        1 ||   O my mind, remain steady, and do not wander away. By searching
        around on the outside, you shall only suffer great pain; the Ambrosial
        Nectar is found within the home of your own being.  ||  Pause
        ||   Renounce corruption, and seek virtue; committing sins, you
        shall only come to regret and repent. You do not know the difference
        between good and evil; again and again, you sink into the mud.
        || 2 ||   Within you is the great filth of greed and falsehood;
        why do you bother to wash your body on the outside? Chant the
        Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord always, under Guru's
        Instruction; only then will your innermost being be emancipated.
        || 3 ||   Let greed and slander be far away from you, and renounce
        falsehood; through the True Word of the Guru's Shabad, you
        shall obtain the true fruit. As it pleases You, You preserve me,
        Dear Lord; servant Nanak sings the Praises of Your Shabad.  ||
        4 || 9 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL,  PANCH-PADAS:  You cannot
        save your own home from being plundered; why do you spy on the
        houses of others? That Gurmukh who joins himself to the Guru's
        service, saves his own home, and tastes the Lord's Nectar.
        || 1 ||   O mind, you must realize what your intellect is focused
        on. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is involved
        with other tastes; the unfortunate wretch shall come to regret
        it in the end.  ||  Pause  ||   When things come, he is pleased,
        but when they go, he weeps and wails; this pain and pleasure remains
        attached to him. The Lord Himself causes him to enjoy pleasure
        and endure pain; the Gurmukh, however, remains unaffected.  ||
        2 ||   What else can be said to be above the subtle essence of
        the Lord? One who drinks it in is satisfied and satiated. One
        who is lured by Maya loses this juice; that faithless cynic is
        tied to his evil-mindedness.  || 3 ||   The Lord is the life of
        the mind, the Master of the breath of life; the Divine Lord is
        contained in the body. If You so bless us, Lord, then we sing
        Your Praises; the mind is satisfied and fulfilled, lovingly attached
        to the Lord.  || 4 ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, the subtle essence of the Lord is obtained; meeting the
        Guru, the fear of death departs. O Nanak, chant the Name of the
        Lord, as Gurmukh; you shall obtain the Lord, and realize your
        pre-ordained destiny.  || 5 || 10 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL:
        Destiny, pre-ordained by the Lord, looms over the heads of all
        beings; no one is without this pre-ordained destiny. Only He Himself
        is beyond destiny; creating the creation by His creative power,
        He beholds it, and causes His Command to be followed.  || 1 ||
        O mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and be at peace. </p>

      <p> Day and night, serve at the Guru's feet; the Lord is the
        Giver, and the Enjoyer.  ||  Pause  ||   He is within  -  see
        Him outside as well; there is no one, other than Him. As Gurmukh,
        look upon all with the single eye of equality; in each and every
        heart, the Divine Light is contained.  || 2 ||   Restrain your
        fickle mind, and keep it steady within its own home; meeting the
        Guru, this understanding is obtained. Seeing the unseen Lord,
        you shall be amazed and delighted; forgetting your pain, you shall
        be at peace. || 3 ||   Drinking in the ambrosial nectar, you shall
        attain the highest bliss, and dwell within the home of your own
        self. So sing the Praises of the Lord, the Destroyer of the fear
        of birth and death, and you shall not be reincarnated again. 
        || 4 ||   The essence, the immaculate Lord, the Light of all  - 
        I am He and He is me  -  there is no difference between us.
        The Infinite Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God  -  Nanak
        has met with Him, the Guru.  || 5 || 11 || </p>

      <p> When I am pleasing to Him, then I sing His Praises. Singing His
        Praises, I receive the fruits of my rewards. The rewards of singing
        His Praises are obtained when He Himself gives them.  || 1 ||
        O my mind, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the treasure
        is obtained; this is why I remain immersed in the True Name. 
        ||  Pause  ||   When I awoke within myself to the Guru's
        Teachings, then I renounced my fickle intellect. When the Light
        of the Guru's Teachings dawned, and then all darkness was
        dispelled.  || 2 ||   When the mind is attached to the Guru's
        Feet, then the Path of Death recedes. Through the Fear of God,
        one attains the Fearless Lord; then, one enters the home of celestial
        bliss.  || 3 ||   Prays Nanak, how rare are those who reflect
        and understand, the most sublime action in this world. The noblest
        deed is to sing the Lord's Praises, and so meet the Lord
        Himself. || 4 || 1 || 12 || </p>

      <p> All of Your servants, who relish the Word of Your Shabad, serve
        You. By Guru's Grace, they become pure, eradicating self-conceit
        from within. Night and day, they continually sing the Glorious
        Praises of the True Lord; they are adorned with the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||   O my Lord and Master, I am Your
        child; I seek Your Sanctuary. You are the One and Only Lord, the
        Truest of the True; You Yourself are the Destroyer of ego.  ||
        Pause  ||   Those who remain wakeful obtain God; through the
        Word of the Shabad, they conquer their ego. Immersed in family
        life, the Lord's humble servant ever remains detached; he
        reflects upon the essence of spiritual wisdom. Serving the True
        Guru, he finds eternal peace, and he keeps the Lord enshrined
        in his heart.  || 2 ||   This mind wanders in the ten directions;
        it is consumed by the love of duality. </p>

        Name; he wastes away his life in vain. But when he meets the True
        Guru, then he obtains the Name; he sheds egotism and emotional
        attachment.  || 3 ||   The Lord's humble servants are True
        -  they practice Truth, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. The True Lord God unites them with Himself, and they keep
        the True Lord enshrined in their hearts. O Nanak, through the
        Name, I have obtained salvation and understanding; this alone
        is my wealth.  || 4 || 1 ||   SORAT'H,  THIRD MEHL:  The
        True Lord has blessed His devotees with the treasure of devotional
        worship, and the wealth of the Lord's Name. The wealth of
        the Naam, shall never be exhausted; no one can estimate its worth.
        With the wealth of the Naam, their faces are radiant, and they
        attain the True Lord.  || 1 ||   O my mind, through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found. Without the Shabad,
        the world wanders around, and receives its punishment in the Court
        of the Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   Within this body dwell the five
        thieves: sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and
        egotism. They plunder the Nectar, but the self-willed manmukh
        does not realize it; no one hears his complaint. The world is
        blind, and its dealings are blind as well; without the Guru, there
        is only pitch darkness.  || 2 ||   Indulging in egotism and possessiveness,
        they are ruined; when they depart, nothing goes along with them.
        But one who becomes Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and ever contemplates
        the Lord's Name. Through the True Word of Gurbani, he sings
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord; blessed with the Lord's
        Glance of Grace, he is enraptured.  || 3 ||   The spiritual wisdom
        of the True Guru is a steady light within the heart. The Lord's
        decree is over the heads of even kings. Night and day, the Lord's
        devotees worship Him; night and day, they gather in the true profit
        of the Lord's Name. O Nanak, through the Lord's Name,
        one is emancipated; attuned to the Shabad, he finds the Lord.
        || 4 || 2 ||   SORAT'H,  THIRD MEHL:  If one becomes the
        slave of the Lord's slaves, then he finds the Lord, and eradicates
        ego from within. The Lord of bliss is his object of devotion;
        night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Attuned
        to the Word of the Shabad, the Lord's devotees remain ever
        as one, absorbed in the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, Your Glance
        of Grace is True. Show mercy to Your slave, O Beloved Lord, and
        preserve my honor.  ||  Pause  ||   Continually praising the Word
        of the Shabad, I live; under Guru's Instruction, my fear
        has been dispelled. My True Lord God is so beautiful! Serving
        the Guru, my consciousness is focused on Him. One who chants the
        True Word of the Shabad, and the Truest of the True, the Word
        of His Bani, remains wakeful, day and night.  || 2 ||   He is
        so very deep and profound, the Giver of eternal peace; no one
        can find His limit. Serving the Perfect Guru, one becomes carefree,
        enshrining the Lord within the mind. The mind and body become
        immaculately pure, and a lasting peace fills the heart; doubt
        is eradicated from within.  || 3 ||   The Way of the Lord is always
        such a difficult path; only a few find it, contemplating the Guru.
        Imbued with the Lord's Love, and intoxicated with the Shabad,
        he renounces ego and corruption. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam,
        and the Love of the One Lord, he is embellished with the Word
        of the Shabad. </p>

      <p> || 4 || 3 ||   SORAT'H,  THIRD MEHL:  Dear Beloved Lord,
        I praise You continually, as long as there is the breath within
        my body. If I were to forget You, for a moment, even for an instant,
        O Lord Master, it would be like fifty years for me. I was always
        such a fool and an idiot, O Siblings of Destiny, but now, through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, my mind is enlightened.  ||
        1 ||   Dear Lord, You Yourself bestow understanding. Dear Lord,
        I am forever a sacrifice to You; I am dedicated and devoted to
        Your Name.  ||  Pause  ||   I have died in the Word of the Shabad,
        and through the Shabad, I am dead while yet alive, O Siblings
        of Destiny; through the Shabad, I have been liberated. Through
        the Shabad, my mind and body have been purified, and the Lord
        has come to dwell within my mind. The Guru is the Giver of the
        Shabad; my mind is imbued with it, and I remain absorbed in the
        Lord.  || 2 ||   Those who do not know the Shabad are blind and
        deaf; why did they even bother to come into the world? They do
        not obtain the subtle essence of the Lord's elixir; they
        waste away their lives, and are reincarnated over and over again.
        The blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukhs are like maggots in manure,
        and in manure they rot away.  || 3 ||  The Lord Himself creates
        us, watches over us, and places us on the Path, O Siblings of
        Destiny; there is no one other than Him. No one can erase that
        which is pre-ordained, O Siblings of Destiny; whatever the Creator
        wills, comes to pass. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        abides deep within the mind; O Siblings of Destiny, there is no
        other at all.  || 4 || 4 ||   SORAT'H,  THIRD MEHL:  The
        Gurmukhs practice devotional worship, and become pleasing to God;
        night and day, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. You
        Yourself protect and take care of Your devotees, who are pleasing
        to Your Mind. You are the Giver of virtue, realized through the
        Word of Your Shabad. Uttering Your Glories, we merge with You,
        O Glorious Lord.  || 1 ||   O my mind, remember always the Dear
        Lord. At the very last moment, He alone shall be your best friend;
        He shall always stand by you.  ||  Pause  ||   The gathering of
        the wicked enemies shall always practice falsehood; they do not
        contemplate understanding. Who can obtain fruit from the slander
        of evil enemies? Remember that Harnaakhash was torn apart by the
        Lord's claws. Prahlaad, the Lord's humble servant, constantly
        sang the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and the Dear Lord saved
        him.  || 2 ||   The self-willed manmukhs see themselves as being
        very virtuous; they have absolutely no understanding at all. They
        indulge in slander of the humble spiritual people; they waste
        their lives away, and then they have to depart. They never think
        of the Lord's Name, and in the end, they depart, regretting
        and repenting.  || 3 ||   The Lord makes the lives of His devotees
        fruitful; He Himself links them to the Guru's service. Imbued
        with the Word of the Shabad, and intoxicated with celestial bliss,
        night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Slave
        Nanak utters this prayer: O Lord, please, let me fall at their
        feet.  || 4 || 5 ||   SORAT'H,  THIRD MEHL:  He alone is
        a Sikh, a friend, a relative and a sibling, who walks in the Way
        of the Guru's Will. One who walks according to his own will,
        O Siblings of Destiny, suffers separation from the Lord, and shall
        be punished. Without the True Guru, peace is never obtained, O
        Siblings of Destiny; again and again, he regrets and repents.
        || 1 ||   The Lord's slaves are happy, O Siblings of Destiny. </p>

      <p> The sins and sorrows of countless lifetimes are eradicated; the
        Lord Himself unites them in His Union.  ||  Pause  ||   All of
        these relatives are like chains upon the soul, O Siblings of Destiny;
        the world is deluded by doubt. Without the Guru, the chains cannot
        be broken; the Gurmukhs find the door of salvation. One who performs
        rituals without realizing the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        shall die and be reborn, again and again.  || 2 ||   The world
        is entangled in egotism and possessiveness, O Siblings of Destiny,
        but no one belongs to anyone else. The Gurmukhs attain the Mansion
        of the Lord's Presence, singing the Glories of the Lord;
        they dwell in the home of their own inner being. One who understands
        here, realizes himself; the Lord God belongs to him.  || 3 ||
        The True Guru is forever merciful, O Siblings of Destiny; without
        good destiny, what can anyone obtain? He looks alike upon all
        with His Glance of Grace, but people receive the fruits of their
        rewards according to their love for the Lord. O Nanak, when the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind, then
        self-conceit is eradicated from within.  || 4 || 6 ||   SORAT'H,
        THIRD MEHL,  CHAU-TUKAS:  True devotional worship is obtained
        only through the True Guru, when the True Word of His Bani is
        in the heart. Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained;
        egotism is obliterated through the Word of the Shabad. Without
        the Guru, there is no true devotion; otherwise, people wander
        around, deluded by ignorance. The self-willed manmukhs wander
        around, suffering in constant pain; they drown and die, even without
        water.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, remain forever in the
        Lord's Sanctuary, under His Protection. Bestowing His Glance
        of Grace, He preserves our honor, and blesses us with the glory
        of the Lord's Name.  ||  Pause  ||   Through the Perfect
        Guru, one comes to understand himself, contemplating the True
        Word of the Shabad. The Lord, the Life of the world, ever abides
        in his heart, and he renounces sexual desire, anger and egotism.
        The Lord is ever-present, permeating and pervading all places;
        the Name of the Infinite Lord is enshrined within the heart. Throughout
        the ages, through the Word of His Bani, His Shabad is realized,
        and the Name becomes so sweet and beloved to the mind.  || 2 ||
        Serving the Guru, one realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord;
        fruitful is his life, and his coming into the world. Tasting the
        sublime elixir of the Lord, his mind is satisfied and satiated
        forever; singing the Glories of the Glorious Lord, he is fulfilled
        and satisfied. The lotus of his heart blossoms forth, he is ever
        imbued with the Lord's Love, and the unstruck melody of the
        Shabad resounds within him. His body and mind become immaculately
        pure; his speech becomes immaculate as well, and he merges in
        the Truest of the True.  || 3 ||   No one knows the state of the
        Lord's Name; through the Guru's Teachings, it comes
        to abide in the heart. One who becomes Gurmukh, understands the
        Path; his tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord's
        Nectar. Meditation, austere self-discipline and self-restraint
        are all obtained from the Guru; the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        comes to abide within the heart. O Nanak, those humble beings
        who praise the Naam are beautiful; they are honored in the Court
        of the True Lord.  || 4 || 7 ||   SORAT'H,  THIRD MEHL, 
        DU-TUKAS:  Meeting the True Guru, one turns away from the world,
        O Siblings of Destiny; when he remains dead while yet alive, he
        obtains true understanding. He alone is the Guru, and he alone
        is a Sikh, O Siblings of Destiny, whose light merges in the Light.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, be lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har. Chanting the Name of the Lord, it seems so sweet to
        the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; the Gurmukhs obtain a place in
        the Court of the Lord.  ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> Without the Guru, love for the Lord does not well up, O Siblings
        of Destiny; the self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in the love
        of duality. Actions performed by the manmukh are like the threshing
        of the chaff  -  they obtain nothing for their efforts.  ||
        2 ||   Meeting the Guru, the Naam comes to permeate the mind,
        O Siblings of Destiny, with true love and affection. He always
        sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny,
        with infinite love for the Guru.  || 3 ||   How blessed and approved
        is his coming into the world, O Siblings of Destiny, who focuses
        his mind on serving the Guru. O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is
        obtained, O Siblings of Destiny, through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, and we merge with the Lord.  || 4 || 8 ||   SORAT'H,
        THIRD MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:  The three worlds are entangled in
        the three qualities, O Siblings of Destiny; the Guru imparts understanding.
        Attached to the Lord's Name, one is emancipated, O Siblings
        of Destiny; go and ask the wise ones about this.  || 1 ||   O
        mind, renounce the three qualities, and focus your consciousness
        on the fourth state. The Dear Lord abides in the mind, O Siblings
        of Destiny; ever sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  ||  Pause
        ||   From the Naam, everyone originated, O Siblings of Destiny;
        forgetting the Naam, they die away. The ignorant world is blind,
        O Siblings of Destiny; those who sleep are plundered.  || 2 ||
        Those Gurmukhs who remain awake are saved, O Siblings of Destiny;
        they cross over the terrifying world-ocean. In this world, the
        Name of the Lord is the true profit, O Siblings of Destiny; keep
        it enshrined within your heart.  || 3 ||   In the Guru's
        Sanctuary, O Siblings of Destiny, you shall be saved; be lovingly
        attuned to the Lord's Name. O Nanak, the Name of the Lord
        is the boat, and the Name is the raft, O Siblings of Destiny;
        setting out on it, the Lord's humble servant crosses over
        the world-ocean.  || 4 || 9 ||   SORAT'H,  THIRD MEHL,  FIRST
        HOUSE:  The True Guru is the ocean of peace in the world; there
        is no other place of rest and peace. The world is afflicted with
        the painful disease of egotism; dying, only to be reborn, it cries
        out in pain.  || 1 ||   O mind, serve the True Guru, and obtain
        peace. If you serve the True Guru, you shall find peace; otherwise,
        you shall depart, after wasting away your life in vain.  ||  Pause
        ||   Led around by the three qualities, he does many deeds, but
        he does not come to taste and savor the subtle essence of the
        Lord. He says his evening prayers, and makes offerings of water,
        and recites his morning prayers, but without true understanding,
        he still suffers in pain.  || 2 ||   One who serves the True Guru
        is very fortunate; as the Lord so wills, he meets with the Guru.
        Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord, His humble servants
        remain ever satisfied; they eradicate self-conceit from within
        themselves.  || 3 ||   This world is blind, and all act blindly;
        without the Guru, no one finds the Path. O Nanak, meeting with
        the True Guru, one sees with his eyes, and finds the True Lord
        within the home of his own being.  || 4 || 10 ||   SORAT'H,
        THIRD MEHL:  Without serving the True Guru, he suffers in terrible
        pain, and throughout the four ages, he wanders aimlessly. I am
        poor and meek, and throughout the ages, You are the Great Giver
        -  please, grant me the understanding of the Shabad.  || 1
        ||   O Dear Beloved Lord, please show mercy to me. Unite me in
        the Union of the True Guru, the Great Giver, and give me the support
        of the Lord's Name.  ||  Pause  ||   Conquering my desires
        and duality, I have merged in celestial peace, and I have found
        the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord. I have tasted the sublime
        essence of the Lord, and my soul has become immaculately pure;
        the Lord is the Destroyer of sins. </p>

      <p> || 2 ||   Dying in the Word of the Shabad, you shall live forever,
        and you shall never die again. The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam
        is ever-sweet to the mind; but how few are those who obtain the
        Shabad.  || 3 ||   The Great Giver keeps His Gifts in His Hand;
        He gives them to those with whom He is pleased. O Nanak, imbued
        with the Naam, they find peace, and in the Court of the Lord,
        they are exalted.  || 4 || 11 ||   SORAT'H,  THIRD MEHL:
        Serving the True Guru, the divine melody wells up within, and
        one is blessed with wisdom and salvation. The True Name of the
        Lord comes to abide in the mind, and through the Name, one merges
        in the Name.  || 1 ||   Without the True Guru, the whole world
        is insane. The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not realize the
        Word of the Shabad; they are deluded by false doubts.  ||  Pause
        ||   The three-faced Maya had led them astray in doubt, and they
        are snared by the noose of egotism. Birth and death hang over
        their heads, and being reborn from the womb, they suffer in pain.
        || 2 ||   The three qualities permeate the whole world; acting
        in ego, it loses its honor. But one who becomes Gurmukh comes
        to realize the fourth state of celestial bliss; he finds peace
        through the Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||   The three qualities are
        all Yours, O Lord; You Yourself created them. Whatever You do,
        comes to pass. O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, one is emancipated;
        through the Shabad, he is rid of egotism.  || 4 || 12 || </p>

      </center>
      <p> My Beloved Lord Himself pervades and permeates all; He Himself
        is, all by Himself. My Beloved Himself is the trader in this world;
        He Himself is the true banker. My Beloved Himself is the trade
        and the trader; He Himself is the true credit.  || 1 ||   O mind,
        meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, and praise His Name. By Guru's
        Grace, the Beloved, Ambrosial, unapproachable and unfathomable
        Lord is obtained.  ||  Pause  ||   The Beloved Himself sees and
        hears everything; He Himself speaks through the mouths of all
        beings. The Beloved Himself leads us into the wilderness, and
        He Himself shows us the Way. The Beloved Himself is Himself all-in-all;
        He Himself is carefree.  || 2 ||   The Beloved Himself, all by
        Himself, created everything; He Himself links all to their tasks.
        The Beloved Himself creates the Creation, and He Himself destroys
        it. He Himself is the wharf, and He Himself is the ferryman, who
        ferries us across.  || 3 ||   The Beloved Himself is the ocean,
        and the boat; He Himself is the Guru, the boatman who steers it.
        The Beloved Himself sets sail and crosses over; He, the King,
        beholds His wondrous play. The Beloved Himself is the Merciful
        Master; O servant Nanak, He forgives and blends with Himself.
        || 4 || 1 ||   SORAT'H,  FOURTH MEHL:  He Himself is born
        of the egg, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth; He Himself
        is the continents and all the worlds. He Himself is the thread,
        and He Himself is the many beads; through His Almighty Power,
        He has strung the worlds. </p>

        scatter into heaps.  || 1 ||   O my mind, there is no other than
        the Lord for me. The treasure of the Beloved Naam is within the
        True Guru; in His Mercy, he pours the Ambrosial Nectar into my
        mouth.  ||  Pause  ||   The Beloved Himself is in all the oceans
        and lands; whatever God does, comes to pass. The Beloved brings
        nourishment to all; there is no other than Him. The Beloved Himself
        plays, and whatever He Himself does, comes to pass.  || 2 || 
        The Beloved Himself, all by Himself, is immaculate and pure;
        He Himself is immaculate and pure. The Beloved Himself determines
        the value of all; whatever He does comes to pass. The Beloved
        Himself is unseen  -  He cannot be seen; He Himself causes
        us to see.  || 3 ||   The Beloved Himself is deep and profound
        and unfathomable; there is no other as great as He. The Beloved
        Himself enjoys every heart; He is contained within every woman
        and man. O Nanak, the Beloved is pervading everywhere, but He
        is hidden; through the Guru, He is revealed.  || 4 || 2 ||   SORAT'H,
        FOURTH MEHL:  He Himself, the Beloved, is Himself all-in-all;
        He Himself establishes and disestablishes. The Beloved Himself
        beholds, and rejoices; God Himself works wonders, and beholds
        them. The Beloved Himself is contained in all the woods and meadows;
        as Gurmukh, He reveals Himself.  || 1 ||   Meditate, O mind, on
        the Lord, Har, Har; through the sublime essence of Lord's

        is the sweetest juice; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        its taste is revealed.  ||  Pause  ||   The Beloved is Himself
        the place of pilgrimage and the raft; God Himself ferries Himself
        across. The Beloved Himself casts the net over all the world;
        the Lord Himself is the fish. The Beloved Himself is infallible;
        He makes no mistakes. There is no other like Him to be seen. 
        || 2 ||   The Beloved Himself is the Yogi's horn, and the
        sound current of the Naad; He Himself plays the tune. The Beloved
        Himself is the Yogi, the Primal Being; He Himself practices intense
        meditation. He Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is the
        disciple; God Himself imparts the Teachings.  || 3 ||   The Beloved
        Himself inspires us to chant His Name, and He Himself practices
        meditation. The Beloved Himself is the Ambrosial Nectar; He Himself
        is the juice of it. The Beloved Himself praises Himself; servant
        Nanak is satisfied, with the sublime essence of the Lord.  ||
        4 || 3 ||   SORAT'H,  FOURTH MEHL:  God Himself is the balance
        scale, He Himself is the weigher, and He Himself weighs with the
        weights. He Himself is the banker, He Himself is the trader, and
        He Himself makes the trades. The Beloved Himself fashioned the
        world, and He Himself counter-balances it with a gram.  || 1 ||
        My mind meditates on the Lord, Har, Har, and finds peace. The
        Name of the Beloved Lord, Har, Har, is a treasure; the Perfect
        Guru has made it seem sweet to me.  ||  Pause  ||   The Beloved
        Himself is the earth, and He Himself is the water; He Himself
        acts, and causes others to act. The Beloved Himself issues His
        Commands, and keeps the water and the land bound down. <br>
