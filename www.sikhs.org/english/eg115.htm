      <p> Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and be rid of
        your ego. True Yoga shall come to dwell in your mind.  || 8 ||
        He blessed you with body and soul, but you do not even think
        of Him. You fool! Visiting graves and cremation grounds is not
        Yoga.  || 9 ||   Nanak chants the sublime, glorious Bani of the
        Word. Understand it, and appreciate it.  || 10 || 5 ||   BASANT,
        FIRST MEHL:  In duality and evil-mindedness, the mortal acts
        blindly. The self-willed manmukh wanders, lost in the darkness.
        || 1 ||   The blind man follows blind advice. Unless one takes
        the Guru's Way, his doubt is not dispelled.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The manmukh is blind; he does not like the Guru's
        Teachings. He has become a beast; he cannot get rid of his egotistical
        pride.  || 2 ||   God created 8.4 million species of beings. My
        Lord and Master, by the Pleasure of His Will, creates and destroys
        them.  || 3 ||   All are deluded and confused, without the Word
        of the Shabad and good conduct. He alone is instructed in this,
        who is blessed by the Guru, the Creator.  || 4 ||   The Guru's
        servants are pleasing to our Lord and Master. The Lord forgives
        them, and they no longer fear the Messenger of Death.  || 5 ||
        Those who love the One Lord with all their heart - He
        dispels their doubts and unites them with Himself.  || 6 ||  
        God is Independent, Endless and Infinite. The Creator Lord is
        pleased with Truth.  || 7 ||   O Nanak, the Guru instructs the
        mistaken soul. He implants the Truth within him, and shows him
        the One Lord.  || 8 || 6 ||   BASANT,  FIRST MEHL:  He Himself
        is the bumble bee, the fruit and the vine. He Himself unites us
        with the Sangat - the Congregation, and the Guru, our Best
        Friend.  || 1 ||   O bumble bee, suck in that fragrance, which
        causes the trees to flower, and the woods to grow lush foliage.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself is Lakshmi, and He Himself is
        her husband. He established the world by Word of His Shabad, and
        He Himself ravishes it.  || 2 ||   He Himself is the calf, the
        cow and the milk. He Himself is the Support of the body-mansion.
        || 3 ||   He Himself is the Deed, and He Himself is the Doer.
        As Gurmukh, He contemplates Himself.  || 4 ||   You create the
        creation, and gaze upon it, O Creator Lord. You give Your Support
        to the uncounted beings and creatures.  || 5 ||   You are the
        Profound, Unfathomable Ocean of Virtue. You are the Unknowable,
        the Immaculate, the most Sublime Jewel.  || 6 ||   You Yourself
        are the Creator, with the Potency to create. You are the Independent
        Ruler, whose people are at peace.  || 7 ||   Nanak is satisfied
        with the subtle taste of the Lord's Name.  || 8 || 7 || <br>

        - Your Shakti.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your army is the fire
        in the home of each and every heart. And Dharma - righteous

      <p> But the mortal becomes unsatisfied, and begs for more; his fickle
        mind brings him disgrace. Greed is the dark dungeon, and demerits
        are the shackles on his feet.  || 3 ||   His wealth constantly
        batters him, and sin acts as the police officer. Whether the mortal
        is good or bad, he is as You look upon him, O Lord.  || 4 || 
        The Primal Lord God is called Allah. The Shaykh's turn
        has now come. The temples of the gods are subject to taxes; this
        is what it has come to.  || 5 ||   The Muslim devotional pots,
        calls to prayer, prayers and prayer mats are everywhere; the Lord
        appears in blue robes. In each and every home, everyone uses Muslim
        greetings; your speech has changed, O people.  || 6 ||   You,
        O my Lord and Master, are the King of the earth; what power do
        I have to challenge You? In the four directions, people bow in
        humble adoration to You; Your Praises are sung in each and every
        heart.  || 7 ||   Making pilgrimages to sacred shrines, reading
        the Simritees and giving donations in charity - these do
        bring any profit. O Nanak, glorious greatness is obtained in an
        instant, remembering the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 8 ||

      <p> <font color="#000000">Within the body-village there lives a child
        who cannot hold still, even for an instant. It makes so many efforts,
        and grows weary, but still, it wanders restlessly again and again.
        || 1 ||   O my Lord and Master, Your child has come home, to
        be one with You. Meeting the True Guru, he finds the Perfect Lord.
        Meditating and vibrating on the Name of the Lord, he receives
        the Insignia of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   These are dead
        corpses, these bodies of all the people of the world; the Name
        of the Lord does not dwell in them. The Guru leads us to taste
        the water of the Lord's Name, and then we savor and enjoy
        it, and our bodies are rejuvenated.  || 2 ||   I have examined
        and studied and searched my entire body, and as Gurmukh, I behold
        a miraculous wonder. All the faithless cynics searched outside
        and died, but following the Guru's Teachings, I have found
        the Lord within the home of my own heart.  || 3 ||   God is Merciful
        to the meekest of the meek; Krishna came to the house of Bidar,
        a devotee of low social status. Sudama loved God, who came to
        meet him; God sent everything to his home, and ended his poverty.
        || 4 ||   Great is the glory of the Name of the Lord. My Lord
        and Master Himself has enshrined it within me. Even if all the
        faithless cynics continue slandering me, it is not diminished
        by even one iota.  || 5 ||   The Lord's Name is the praise
        of His humble servant. It brings him honor in the ten directions.
        The slanderers and the faithless cynics cannot endure it at all;
        they have set fire to their own houses.  || 6 ||   The humble
        person meeting with another humble person obtains honor. In the
        glory of the Lord, their glory shines forth. The servants of my
        Lord and Master are loved by the Beloved. They are the slaves
        of His slaves.  || 7 ||   The Creator Himself is the Water; He
        Himself unites us in His Union. <br>

        Company of the Holy. The Lord definitely met Dhroo.  || 1 || 
        I beg for the dust of the feet of Your Saints. Please bless me
        with Your Mercy, Lord, that I may apply it to my forehead.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Ganika the prostitute was saved, when her parrot
        uttered the Lord's Name. The elephant meditated on the
        Lord, and was saved. He delivered the poor Brahmin Sudama out
        of poverty. O my mind, you too must meditate and vibrate on the
        Lord of the Universe.  || 2 ||   Even the hunter who shot an arrow
        at Krishna was saved. Kubija the hunchback was saved, when God
        placed His Feet on her thumb. Bidar was saved by his attitude
        of humility. O my mind, you too must meditate on the Lord.  ||
        3 ||   The Lord Himself saved the honor of Prahlaad. Even when
        she was being disrobed in court, Dropatee's honor was preserved.
        Those who have served the Lord, even at the very last instant
        of their lives, are saved. O my mind, serve Him, and you shall
        be carried across to the other side.  || 4 ||   Dhanna served
        the Lord, with the innocence of a child. Meeting with the Guru,
        Trilochan attained the perfection of the Siddhas. The Guru blessed
        Baynee with His Divine Illumination. O my mind, you too must be
        the Lord's slave.  || 5 ||   Jai Dayv gave up his egotism.
        Sain the barber was saved through his selfless service. Do not
        let your mind waver or wander; do not let it go anywhere. O my
        mind, you too shall cross over; seek the Sanctuary of God.  ||
        6 ||   O my Lord and Master, You have shown Your Mercy to them.
        You saved those devotees. You do not take their merits and demerits
        into account. Seeing these ways of Yours, I have dedicated my
        mind to Your service.  || 7 ||   Kabeer meditated on the One Lord
        with love. Naam Dayv lived with the Dear Lord. Ravi Daas meditated
        on God, the Incomparably Beautiful. Guru Nanak Dayv is the Embodiment
        of the Lord of the Universe.  || 8 || 1 ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The mortal wanders in reincarnation through countless lifetimes.
        Without meditating in remembrance on the Lord, he falls into hell.
        Without devotional worship, he is cut apart into pieces. Without
        understanding, he is punished by the Messenger of Death.  || 1
        ||   Meditate and vibrate forever on the Lord of the Universe,
        O my friend. Love forever the True Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Contentment does not come by any endeavors. All the
        show of Maya is just a cloud of smoke. The mortal does not hesitate
        to commit sins. Intoxicated with poison, he comes and goes in
        reincarnation.  || 2 ||   Acting in egotism and self-conceit,
        his corruption only increases. The world is drowning in attachment
        and greed. Sexual desire and anger hold the mind in its power.
        Even in his dreams, he does not chant the Lord's Name.
        || 3 ||   Sometimes he is a king, and sometimes he is a beggar.
        The world is bound by pleasure and pain. The mortal makes no arrangements
        to save himself. The bondage of sin continues to hold him.  ||
        4 ||   He has no beloved friends or companions. <br>

      <p> He himself eats what he himself plants. He gathers up that which
        brings corruption; leaving them, the fool must depart in an instant.
        || 5 ||   He wanders in attachment to Maya. He acts in accordance
        with the karma of his past actions. Only the Creator Himself remains
        detached. God is not affected by virtue or vice.  || 6 ||   Please
        save me, O Merciful Lord of the Universe! I seek Your Sanctuary,
        O Perfect Compassionate Lord. Without You, I have no other place
        of rest. Please take pity on me, God, and bless me with Your Name.

        pervades in all alike.  || 3 || 1 ||   The Pandits, the Hindu
        religious scholars, are intoxicated, reading the Puraanas. The
        Yogis are intoxicated in Yoga and meditation. The Sannyaasees
        are intoxicated in egotism. The penitents are intoxicated with
        the mystery of penance.  || 1 ||   All are intoxicated with the
        wine of Maya; no one is awake and aware. The thieves are with
        them, plundering their homes.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Suk Dayv and
        Akrur are awake and aware. <br>

      <p> Hanuman with his tail is awake and aware. Shiva is awake, serving
        at the Lord's Feet. Naam Dayv and Jai Dayv are awake in
        this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.  || 2 ||   There are many ways of
        being awake, and sleeping. To be awake as Gurmukh is the most
        excellent way. The most sublime of all the actions of this body,
        says Kabeer, is to meditate and vibrate on the Lord's Name.
        || 3 || 2 ||   The wife gives birth to her husband. The son leads
        his father in play. Without breasts, the mother nurses her baby.
        || 1 ||   Behold, people! This is how it is in the Dark Age of
        Kali Yuga. The son marries his mother.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without
        feet, the mortal jumps. Without a mouth, he bursts into laughter.
        Without feeling sleepy, he lays down and sleeps. Without a churn,
        the milk is churned.  || 2 ||   Without udders, the cow gives
        milk. Without travelling, a long journey is made. Without the
        True Guru, the path is not found. Says Kabeer, see this, and understand.
        || 3 || 3 ||   Prahlaad was sent to school. He took many of his
        friends along with him. He asked his teacher, &quot;Why do you
        teach me about worldly affairs? Write the Name of the Dear Lord
        on my tablet.&quot;  || 1 ||   O Baba, I will not forsake the
        Name of the Lord. I will not bother with any other lessons.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Sanda and Marka went to the king to complain.
        He sent for Prahlaad to come at once. He said to him, &quot;Stop
        uttering the Lord's Name. I shall release you at once,
        if you obey my words.&quot;  || 2 ||   Prahlaad answered, &quot;Why
        do you annoy me, over and over again? God created the water, land,
        hills and mountains. I shall not forsake the One Lord; if I did,
        I would be going against my Guru. You might as well throw me into
        the fire and kill me.&quot;  || 3 ||   The king became angry
        and drew his sword. &quot;Show me your protector now!&quot;
        So God emerged out of the pillar, and assumed a mighty form. He
        killed Harnaakhash, tearing him apart with his nails.  || 4 ||
        The Supreme Lord God, the Divinity of the divine, for the sake
        of His devotee, assumed the form of the man-lion. Says Kabeer,
        no one can know the Lord's limits. He saves His devotees
        like Prahlaad over and over again.  || 5 || 4 ||   Within the
        body and mind are thieves like sexual desire, which has stolen
        my jewel of spiritual wisdom. I am a poor orphan, O God; unto
        whom should I complain? Who has not been ruined by sexual desire?
        What am I?  || 1 ||   O Lord, I cannot endure this agonizing pain.
        What power does my fickle mind have against it?  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Sanak, Sanandan, Shiva and Suk Dayv were born out of Brahma's
        naval chakra. The poets and the Yogis with their matted hair all
        lived their lives with good behavior.  || 2 ||   You are Unfathomable;
        I cannot know Your depth. O God, Master of the meek, unto whom
        should I tell my pains? Please rid me of the pains of birth and
        death, and bless me with peace. Kabeer utters the Glorious Praises
        of God, the Ocean of peace.  || 3 || 5 ||   There is one merchant
        and five traders. The twenty-five oxen carry false merchandise.
        There are nine poles which hold the ten bags. The body is tied
        by the seventy-two ropes.  || 1 || <br>

      <p> I don't care at all about such commerce. It depletes my
        capital, and the interest charges only increase.  ||  Pause  ||
        Weaving the seven threads together, they carry on their trade.
        They are led on by the karma of their past actions. The three
        tax-collectors argue with them. The traders depart empty-handed.
        || 2 ||   Their capital is exhausted, and their trade is ruined.
        The caravan is scattered in the ten directions. Says Kabeer, O
        mortal, your tasks will be accomplished, when you merge in the
        Celestial Lord; let your doubts run away.  || 3 || 6 || <br>

        Where should I sit to eat my meal?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The tongue
        is impure, and its speech is impure. The eyes and ears are totally
        impure. The impurity of the sexual organs does not depart; the
        Brahmin is burnt by the fire.  || 2 ||   The fire is impure, and
        the water is impure. The place where you sit and cook is impure.
