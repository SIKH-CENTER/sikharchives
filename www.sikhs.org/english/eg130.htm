      </p>
      <p> <font color="#000000">Meditate in remembrance on the Lord -
        meditate on the Lord; this alone shall be of use to you. Abandon
        your association with Maya, and take shelter in the Sanctuary
        of God. Remember that the pleasures of the world are false; this
        whole show is just an illusion.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You must
        understand that this wealth is just a dream. Why are you so proud?
        The empires of the earth are like walls of sand.  || 1 ||   Servant
        Nanak speaks the Truth: your body shall perish and pass away.
        Moment by moment, yesterday passed. Today is passing as well.
        || 2 || 1 ||   JAIJAAVANTEE,  NINTH MEHL:  Meditate on the Lord
        - vibrate on the Lord; your life is slipping away. Why
        am I telling you this again and again? You fool - why don't
        you understand? Your body is like a hail-stone; it melts away
        in no time at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So give up all your doubts,
        and utter the Naam, the Name of the Lord. At the very last moment,
        this alone shall go along with you.  || 1 ||   Forget the poisonous
        sins of corruption, and enshrine the Praises of God in your heart.
        Servant Nanak proclaims that this opportunity is slipping away.
        || 2 || 2 ||   JAIJAAVANTEE,  NINTH MEHL:  O mortal, what will
        your condition be? In this world, you have not listened to the
        Lord's Name. You are totally engrossed in corruption and
        sin; you have not turned your mind away from them at all.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   You obtained this human life, but you have not
        remembered the Lord in meditation, even for an instant. For the
        sake of pleasure, you have become subservient to your woman, and
        now your feet are bound.  || 1 ||   Servant Nanak proclaims that
        the vast expanse of this world is just a dream. Why not meditate
        on the Lord? Even Maya is His slave.  || 2 || 3 ||   JAIJAAVANTEE,
        NINTH MEHL:  Slipping away - your life is uselessly slipping
        away. Night and day, you listen to the Puraanas, but you do not
        understand them, you ignorant fool! <br>

      <p> Death has arrived; now where will you run?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        You believed that this body was permanent, but it shall turn
        to dust. Why don't you chant the Name of the Lord, you
        shameless fool?  || 1 ||   Let devotional worship of the Lord
        enter into your heart, and abandon the intellectualism of your
        mind. O Servant Nanak, this is the way to live in the world.

      <p> <font color="#000000">You study the scriptures, say your prayers
        and argue; you worship stones and sit like a crane, pretending
        to meditate. You speak lies and well-ornamented falsehood, and
        recite your daily prayers three times a day. The mala is around
        your neck, and the sacred tilak mark is on your forehead. You
        wear two loin cloths, and keep your head covered. If you know
        God and the nature of karma, you know that all these rituals and
        beliefs are useless. Says Nanak, meditate on the Lord with faith.
        Without the True Guru, no one finds the Way.  || 1 ||   The mortal's
        life is fruitless, as long as he does not know God. Only a few,
        by Guru's Grace, cross over the world-ocean. The Creator,
        the Cause of causes, is All-powerful. Thus speaks Nanak, after
        deep deliberation. The Creation is under the control of the Creator.
        By His Power, He sustains and supports it.  || 2 ||   The Shabad
        is Yoga, the Shabad is spiritual wisdom; the Shabad is the Vedas
        for the Brahmin. The Shabad is heroic bravery for the Khshaatriya;
        the Shabad is service to others for the Soodra. The Shabad for
        all is the Shabad, the Word of the One God, for one who knows
        this secret. Nanak is the slave of the Divine, Immaculate Lord.
        || 3 ||   The One Lord is the Divinity of all divinities. He
        is the Divinity of the soul. Nanak is the slave of that one who
        knows the Secrets of the soul and the Supreme Lord God. He is
        the Divine Immaculate Lord Himself.  || 4 || <br>

      <p> O Nanak, it brings the blessings of the Saints, the sons of the
        Imperishable Lord.  || 1 ||   Cursed is loving attachment to one's
        mother and father; cursed is loving attachment to one's
        siblings and relatives. Cursed is attachment to the joys of family
        life with one's spouse and children. Cursed is attachment
        to household affairs. Only loving attachment to the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, is True. Nanak dwells there in peace.
        || 2 ||   The body is false; its power is temporary. It grows
        old; its love for Maya increases greatly. The human is only a
        temporary guest in the home of the body, but he has high hopes.
        The Righteous Judge of Dharma is relentless; he counts each and
        every breath. The human body, so difficult to obtain, has fallen
        into the deep dark pit of emotional attachment. O Nanak, its only
        support is God, the Essence of Reality. O God, Lord of the World,
        Lord of the Universe, Master of the Universe, please be kind to
        me.  || 3 ||   This fragile body-fortress is made up of water,
        plastered with blood and wrapped in skin. It has nine gates, but
        no doors; it is supported by pillars of wind, the channels of
        the breath. The ignorant person does not meditate in remembrance
        on the Lord of the Universe; he thinks that this body is permanent.
        This precious body is saved and redeemed in the Sanctuary of the
        Holy, O Nanak, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har,
        Har, Haray.  || 4 ||   O Glorious, Eternal and Imperishable, Perfect
        and Abundantly Compassionate, Profound and Unfathomable, Lofty
        and Exalted, All-knowing and Infinite Lord God. O Lover of Your
        devoted servants, Your Feet are a Sanctuary of Peace. O Master
        of the masterless, Helper of the helpless, Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary.
        || 5 ||   Seeing the deer, the hunter aims his weapons. But if
        one is protected by the Lord of the World, O Nanak, not a hair
        on his head will be touched.  || 6 ||   He may be surrounded on
        all four sides by servants and powerful warriors; he may dwell
        in a lofty place, difficult to approach, and never even think
        of death. But when the Order comes from the Primal Lord God, O
        Nanak, even an ant can take away his breath of life.  || 7 ||
        To be imbued and attuned to the Word of the Shabad; to be kind
        and compassionate; to sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises
        - these are the most worthwhile actions in this Dark Age
        of Kali Yuga. In this way, one's inner doubts and emotional
        attachments are dispelled. God is pervading and permeating all
        places. So obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; He dwells
        upon the tongues of the Holy. O Nanak, meditate and chant the
        Name of the Beloved Lord, Har, Har, Har, Haray.  || 8 ||   Beauty
        fades away, islands fade away, the sun, moon, stars and sky fade
        away. The earth, mountains, forests and lands fade away. One's
        spouse, children, siblings and loved friends fade away. Gold and
        jewels and the incomparable beauty of Maya fade away. Only the
        Eternal, Unchanging Lord does not fade away. O Nanak, only the
        humble Saints are steady and stable forever.  || 9 ||   Do not
        delay in practicing righteousness; delay in committing sins. Implant
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within yourself, and abandon greed.
        In the Sanctuary of the Saints, the sinful residues of past mistakes
        are erased. The character of righteousness is received by that
        person, O Nanak, with whom the Lord is pleased and satisfied.
        || 10 ||   The person of shallow understanding is dying in emotional
        attachment; he is engrossed in pursuits of pleasure with his wife.
        With youthful beauty and golden earrings, wondrous mansions, decorations
        and clothes - this is how Maya clings to him. O Eternal,
        Unchanging, Benevolent Lord God, O Sanctuary of the Saints, Nanak
        humbly bows to You.  || 11 ||   If there is birth, then there
        is death. If there is pleasure, then there is pain. If there is
        enjoyment, then there is disease. If there is high, then there
        is low. <br>

      <p> If there is small, then there is great. If there is power, then
        there is pride. If there is egotistical pride, then there will
        be a fall. Engrossed in worldly ways, one is ruined. Meditating
        and vibrating on the Lord of the Universe in the Company of the
        Holy, you shall become steady and stable. Nanak vibrates and meditates
        on the Lord God.  || 12 ||   By the Grace of God, genuine understanding
        comes to the mind. The intellect blossoms forth, and one finds
        a place in the realm of celestial bliss. The senses are brought
        under control, and pride is abandoned. The heart is cooled and
        soothed, and the wisdom of the Saints is implanted within. Reincarnation
        is ended, and the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan
        is obtained. O Nanak, the musical instrument of the Word of the
        Shabad vibrates and resounds within.  || 13 ||   The Vedas preach
        and recount God's Glories; people hear them by various
        ways and means. The Merciful Lord, Har, Har, implants spiritual
        wisdom within. Nanak begs for the Gift of the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord. The Guru is the Great Giver, the Lord of the World.
        || 14 ||   Do not worry so much about your mother, father and
        siblings. Do not worry so much about other people. Do not worry
        about your spouse, children and friends. You are obsessed with
        your involvements in Maya. The One Lord God is Kind and Compassionate,
        O Nanak. He is the Cherisher and Nurturer of all living beings.
        || 15 ||   Wealth is temporary; conscious existence is temporary;
        hopes of all sorts are temporary. The bonds of love, attachment,
        egotism, doubt, Maya and the pollution of corruption are temporary.
        The mortal passes through the fire of the womb of reincarnation
        countless times. He does not remember the Lord in meditation;
        his understanding is polluted. O Lord of the Universe, when You
        grant Your Grace, even sinners are saved. Nanak dwells in the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 16 ||   You may drop
        down from the mountains, and fall into the nether regions of the
        underworld, or be burnt in the blazing fire, or swept away by
        the unfathomable waves of water; but the worst pain of all is
        household anxiety, which is the source of the cycle of death and
        rebirth. No matter what you do, you cannot break its bonds, O
        Nanak. Man's only Support, Anchor and Mainstay is the Word
        of the Shabad, and the Holy, Friendly Saints.  || 17 ||   Excruciating
        pain, countless killings, reincarnation, poverty and terrible
        misery are all destroyed by meditating in remembrance on the Lord's
        Name, O Nanak, just as fire reduces piles of wood to ashes.  ||
        18 ||   Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the darkness is
        illuminated. Dwelling on His Glorious Praises, the ugly residues
        of sins are destroyed. Enshrining the Lord deep within the heart,
        and with the immaculate karma of doing good deeds, one strikes
        fear into the demons. The cycle of coming and going in reincarnation
        is ended, absolute peace is obtained, and the Fruitful Vision
        of the Lord's Darshan. He is Potent to give Protection,
        He is the Lover of His Saints. O Nanak, the Lord God blesses all
        with bliss.  || 19 ||   Those who were left behind - the
        Lord brings them to the front. He fulfills the hopes of the hopeless.
        He makes the poor rich, and cures the illnesses of the ill. He
        blesses His devotees with devotion. They sing the Kirtan of the
        Praises of the Lord's Name. O Nanak, those who serve the
        Guru find the Supreme Lord God, the Great Giver  || 20 ||   He
        gives Support to the unsupported. The Name of the Lord is the
        Wealth of the poor. The Lord of the Universe is the Master of
        the masterless; the Beautiful-haired Lord is the Power of the
        weak. The Lord is Merciful to all beings, Eternal and Unchanging,
        the Family of the meek and humble. The All-knowing, Perfect, Primal
        Lord God is the Lover of His devotees, the Embodiment of Mercy. <br>

      </p>
      <p> The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent, Luminous Lord, dwells
        in each and every heart. Nanak begs for this blessing from the
        Merciful Lord, that he may never forget Him, never forget Him.
        || 21 ||   I have no power; I do not serve You, and I do not
        love You, O Supreme Sublime Lord God. By Your Grace, Nanak meditates
        on the Naam, the Name of the Merciful Lord, Har, Har.  || 22 ||
        The Lord feeds and sustains all living beings; He blesses them
        gifts of restful peace and fine clothes. He created the jewel
        of human life, with all its cleverness and intelligence. By His
        Grace, mortals abide in peace and bliss. O Nanak, meditating in
        remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har, Haray, the mortal is released
        from attachment to the world.  || 23 ||   The kings of the earth
        are eating up the blessings of the good karma of their past lives.
        Those cruel-minded rulers who oppress the people, O Nanak, shall
        suffer in pain for a very long time.  || 24 ||   Those who meditate
        in remembrance on the Lord in their hearts, look upon even pain
        as God's Grace. The healthy person is very sick, if he
        does not remember the Lord, the Embodiment of Mercy.  || 25 ||
        To sing the Kirtan of God's Praises is the righteous
        duty incurred by taking birth in this human body. The Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, is Ambrosial Nectar, O Nanak. The Saints drink
        it in, and never have enough of it.  || 26 ||   The Saints are
        tolerant and good-natured; friends and enemies are the same to
        them. O Nanak, it is all the same to them, whether someone offers
        them all sorts of foods, or slanders them, or draws weapons to
        kill them.  || 27 ||   They pay no attention to dishonor or disrespect.
        They are not bothered by gossip; the miseries of the world do
        not touch them. Those who join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, and chant the Name of the Lord of the Universe -
        O Nanak, those mortals abide in peace.  || 28 ||   The Holy people
        are an invincible army of spiritual warriors; their bodies are
        protected by the armor of humility. Their weapons are the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord which they chant; their Shelter and Shield
        is the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The horses, chariots
        and elephants they ride are their way to realize God's
        Path. They walk fearlessly through the armies of their enemies;
        they attack them with the Kirtan of God's Praises. They
        conquer the entire world, O Nanak, and overpower the five thieves.
        || 29 ||   Misled by evil-mindedness, mortals are engrossed in
        the mirage of the illusory world, like the passing shade of a
        tree. Emotional attachment to family is false, so Nanak meditates
        in remembrance on the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam.  || 30 ||
        I do not possess the treasure of the wisdom of the Vedas, nor
        do I possess the merits of the Praises of the Naam. I do not have
        a beautiful voice to sing jewelled melodies; I am not clever,
        wise or shrewd. By destiny and hard work, the wealth of Maya is
        obtained. O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        even fools become religious scholars.  || 31 ||   The mala around
        my neck is the chanting of the Lord's Name. The Love of
        the Lord is my silent chanting. Chanting this most Sublime Word
        brings salvation and joy to the eyes.  || 32 ||   That mortal
        who lacks the Guru's Mantra - cursed and contaminated
        is his life. That blockhead is just a dog, a pig, a jackass, a
        crow, a snake.  || 33 || <br>

      <p> Whoever contemplates the Lord's Lotus Feet, and enshrines
        His Name within the heart, and sings the Kirtan of His Praises
        in the Saadh Sangat, O Nanak, shall never see the Messenger of
        Death.  || 34 ||   Wealth and beauty are not so difficult to obtain.
        Paradise and royal power are not so difficult to obtain. Foods
        and delicacies are not so difficult to obtain. Elegant clothes
        are not so difficuilt to obtain. Children, friends, siblings and
        relatives are not so difficult to obtain. The pleasures of woman
        are not so difficult to obtain. Knowledge and wisdom are not so
        difficult to obtain. Cleverness and trickery are not so difficult
        to obtain. Only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is difficult to
        obtain. O Nanak, it is only obtained by God's Grace, in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 35 ||   Wherever
        I look, I see the Lord, whether in this world, in paradise, or
        the nether regions of the underworld. The Lord of the Universe
        is All-pervading everywhere. O Nanak, no blame or stain sticks
        to Him.  || 36 ||   Poison is transformed into nectar, and enemies
        into friends and companions. Pain is changed into pleasure, and
        the fearful become fearless. Those who have no home or place find
        their place of rest in the Naam, O Nanak, when the Guru, the Lord,
        becomes Merciful.  || 37 ||   He blesses all with humility; He
        has blessed me with humility as well. He purifies all, and He
        has purified me as well. The Creator of all is the Creator of
        me as well. O Nanak, no blame or stain sticks to Him.  || 38 ||
        The moon-god is not cool and calm, nor is the white sandalwood
        tree. The winter season is not cool; O Nanak, only the Holy friends,
        the Saints, are cool and calm.  || 39 ||   Through the Mantra
        of the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, one meditates on the All-pervading
        Lord. Those who have the wisdom to look alike upon pleasure and
        pain, live the immaculate lifestyle, free of vengeance. They are
        kind to all beings; they have overpowered the five thieves. They
        take the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise as their food; they
        remain untouched by Maya, like the lotus in the water. They share
        the Teachings with friend and enemy alike; they love the devotional
        worship of God. They do not listen to slander; renouncing self-conceit,
        they become the dust of all. Whoever has these six qualities,
        O Nanak, is called a Holy friend.  || 40 ||   The goat enjoys
        eating fruits and roots, but if it lives near a tiger, it is always
        anxious. This is the condition of the world, O Nanak; it is afflicted
        by pleasure and pain.  || 41 ||   Fraud, false accusations, millions
        of diseases, sins and the filthy residues of evil mistakes; doubt,
        emotional attachment, pride, dishonor and intoxication with Maya
        - these lead mortals to death and rebirth, wandering lost
        in hell. In spite of all sorts of efforts, salvation is not found.
        Chanting and meditating on the Name of the Lord in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, mortals become immaculate and
        pure. They continually dwell upon the Glorious Praises of God.
        || 42 ||   In the Sanctuary of the Kind-hearted Lord, our Transcendent
        Lord and Master, we are carried across. God is the Perfect, All-powerful
        Cause of causes; He is the Giver of gifts. He gives hope to the
        hopeless. He is the Source of all riches. Nanak meditates in remembrance
        on the Treasure of Virtue; we are all beggars, begging at His
        Door.  || 43 ||   The most difficult place becomes easy, and the
        worst pain turns into pleasure. Evil words, differences and doubts
        are obliterated, and even faithless cynics and malicious gossips
        become good people. They become steady and stable, whether happy
        or sad; their fears are taken away, and they are fearless. <br>

      <p> The dreadful woods become a well-populated city; such are the
        merits of the righteous life of Dharma, given by God's
        Grace. Chanting the Lord's Name in the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, O Nanak, the Lotus Feet of the Merciful Lord
        are found.  || 44 ||   O emotional attachment, you are the invincible
        warrior of the battlefield of life; you totally crush and destroy
        even the most powerful. You entice and fascinate even the heavenly
        heralds, celestial singers, gods, mortals, beasts and birds. Nanak
        bows in humble surrender to the Lord; he seeks the Sanctuary of
        the Lord of the Universe.  || 45 ||   O sexual desire, you lead
        the mortals to hell; you make them wander in reincarnation through
        countless species. You cheat the consciousness, and pervade the
        three worlds. You destroy meditation, penance and virtue. But
        you give only shallow pleasure, while you make the mortals weak
        and unsteady; you pervade the high and the low. Your fear is dispelled
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, through
        the Protection and Support of the Lord.  || 46 ||   O anger, you
        are the root of conflict; compassion never rises up in you. You
        take the corrupt, sinful beings in your power, and make them dance
        like monkeys. Associating with you, mortals are debased and punished
        by the Messenger of Death in so many ways. O Destroyer of the
        pains of the poor, O Merciful God, Nanak prays for You to protect
        all begins from such anger.  || 47 ||   O greed, you cling to
        even the great, assaulting them with countless waves. You cause
        them to run around wildly in all directions, wobbling and wavering
        unsteadily. You have no respect for friends, ideals, relations,
        mother or father. You make them do what they should not do. You
        make them eat what they should not eat. You make them accomplish
        what they should not accomplish. Save me, save me - I have
        come to Your Sanctuary, O my Lord and Master; Nanak prays to the
        Lord.  || 48 ||   O egotism, you are the root of birth and death
        and the cycle of reincarnation; you are the very soul of sin.
        You forsake friends, and hold tight to enemies. You spread out
        countless illusions of Maya. You cause the living beings to come
        and go until they are exhausted. You lead them to experience pain
        and pleasure. You lead them to wander lost in the terrible wilderness
        of doubt; you lead them to contract the most horrible, incurable
        diseases. The only Physician is the Supreme Lord, the Transcendent
        Lord God. Nanak worships and adores the Lord, Har, Har, Haray.
        || 49 ||   O Lord of the Universe, Master of the Breath of life,
        Treasure of Mercy, Guru of the World. O Destroyer of the fever
        of the world, Embodiment of Compassion, please take away all my
        pain. O Merciful Lord, Potent to give Sanctuary, Master of the
        meek and humble, please be kind to me. Whether his body is healthy
        or sick, let Nanak meditate in remembrance on You, Lord.  || 50
        ||   I have come to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Lotus Feet,
        where I sing the Kirtan of His Praises. In the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, Nanak is carried across the utterly terrifying,
        difficult world-ocean.  || 51 ||   The Supreme Lord God has procted
        my head and forehead; the Transcendent Lord has protected my hands
        and body. God, my Lord and Master, has saved my soul; the Lord
        of the Universe has saved my wealth and feet. The Merciful Guru
        has protected everything, and destroyed my fear and suffering.
        God is the Lover of His devotees, the Master of the masterless.
        Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Imperishable Primal Lord
        God.  || 52 ||   His Power supports the sky, and locks fire within
        wood. <br>

      <p> His Power supports the moon, the sun and the stars, and infuses
        light and breath into the body. His Power provides nourishment
        in the womb of the mother, and does not let disease strike. His
        Power holds back the ocean, O Nanak, and does not allow the waves
        of water to destroy the land.  || 53 ||   The Lord of the World
        is Supremely Beautiful; His Meditation is the Life of all. In
        the Society of the Saints, O Nanak, He is found on the path of
        devotional worship of the Lord.  || 54 ||   The mosquito pierces
        the stone, the ant crosses the swamp, the cripple crosses the
        ocean, and the blind sees in the darkness, meditating on the Lord
        of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary
        of the Lord, Har, Har, Haray.  || 55 ||   Like a Brahmin without
        a sacred mark on his forehead, or a king without the power of
        command, or a warrior without weapons, so is the devotee of God
        without Dharmic Faith.  || 56 ||   God has no conch-shell, no
        religious mark, no paraphernalia; he does not have blue skin.
        His Form is Wondrous and Amazing. He is beyond incarnation. The
        Vedas say that He is not this, and not that. The Lord of the Universe
        is Lofty and High, Great and Infinite. The Imperishable Lord abides
        in the hearts of the Holy. He is understood, O Nanak, by those
        who are very fortunate.  || 57 ||   Living in the world, it is
        like a wild jungle. One's relatives are like dogs, jackals
        and donkeys. In this difficult place, the mind is intoxicated
        with the wine of emotional attachment; the five unconquered thieves
        lurk there. The mortals wander lost in love and emotional attachment,
        fear and doubt; they are caught in the sharp, strong noose of
        egotism. The ocean of fire is terrifying and impassable. The distant
        shore is so far away; it cannot be reached. Vibrate and meditate
        on the Lord of the World, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy; O Nanak, by His Grace, we are saved at the Lotus Feet
        of the Lord.  || 58 ||   When the Lord of the Universe grants
        His Grace, all illnesses are cured. Nanak chants His Glorious
        Praises in the Saadh Sangat, in the Sanctuary of the Perfect Transcendent
        Lord God.  || 59 ||   The mortal is beautiful and speaks sweet
        words, but in the farm of his heart, he harbors cruel vengeance.
        He pretends to bow in worship, but he is false. Beware of him,
        O friendly Saints.  || 60 ||   The thoughtless fool does not know
        that each day, his breaths are being used up. His most beautiful
        body is wearing away; old age, the daughter of death, has seized
        it. He is engrossed in family play; placing his hopes in transitory
        things, he indulges in corrupt pleasures. Wandering lost in countless
        incarnations, he is exhausted. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the
        Embodiment of Mercy.  || 61 ||   O tongue, you love to enjoy the
        sweet delicacies. You are dead to the Truth, and involved in great
        disputes, whether to call God Gobind, or Daamodar, or Maadhav.
        || 62 ||   Those who are proud, and intoxicated with the pleasures
        of sex, and asserting their power over others, never contemplate
        the Lord's Lotus Feet. Their lives are cursed, and as worthless
        as straw. You are as tiny and insignificant as an ant, but you
        shall become great, by the Wealth of the Lord's Meditation.
        Nanak bows in humble worship, countless times, over and over again.
        || 63 ||   The blade of grass becomes a mountain, and the barren
        land becomes green. The drowning one swims across, and the empty
        is filled to overflowing. Millions of suns illuminate the darkness,
        prays Nanak, when the Guru, the Lord, becomes Merciful.  || 64

      <p> Associating with the Brahmin, one is saved, if his actions are
        perfect and God-like. Those whose souls are imbued with the world
        - O Nanak, their lives are fruitless.  || 65 ||   The mortal
        steals the wealth of others, and makes all sorts of problems;
        his preaching is only for his own livelihood. His desire for this
        and that is not satisfied; his mind is caught in Maya, and he
        is acting like a pig.  || 66 ||   Those who are intoxicated and
        absorbed in the Lord's Lotus Feet are saved from the terrifying
        world-ocean. Countless sins are destroyed, O Nanak, in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy; there is no doubt about this.

        one is proud of his foul-smelling marrow, blood and bones.  ||
        1 ||   Even if the mortal could reduce himself to the size of
        an atom, and shoot through the ethers, worlds and realms in the
        blink of an eye, O Nanak, without the Holy Saint, he shall not
        be saved.  || 2 ||   Know for sure that death will come; whatever
        is seen is false. So chant the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; this alone shall

        lost in Maya, attached to friends and relatives. Vibrating and
        meditating on the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat, O
        Nanak, the eternal place of rest is found.  || 4 ||   The lowly
        nim tree, growing near the sandalwood tree, becomes just like
        the sandalwood tree. But the bamboo tree, also growing near it,
        does not pick up its fragrance; it is too tall and proud.  ||
        5 ||   In this Gaat'haa, the Lord's Sermon is woven;
        listening to it, pride is crushed. The five enemies are killed,
        O Nanak, by shooting the Arrow of the Lord.  || 6 ||   The Words
        of the Holy are the path of peace. They are obtained by good karma.
        The cycle of birth and death is ended, O Nanak, singing the Kirtan
        of the Lord's Praises.  || 7 ||   When the leaves wither
        and fall, they cannot be attached to the branch again. Without
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, there is misery and suffering.
        The mortal wanders in reincarnation day and night.  || 8 ||  
        One is blessed with love for the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, by great good fortune. Whoever sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord's Name, O Nanak, is not affected by the world-ocean.
        || 9 ||   This Gaat'haa is profound and infinite; how
        rare are those who understand it. They forsake sexual desire and
        worldly love, O Nanak, and praise the Lord in the Saadh Sangat.
        || 10 ||   The Words of the Holy are the most sublime Mantra.
        They eradicate millions of sinful mistakes. Meditating on the
        Lotus Feet of the Lord, O Nanak, all one's generations
        are saved.  || 11 ||   That palace is beautiful, in which the
        Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung. Those who dwell
        on the Lord of the Universe are liberated. O Nanak, only the most
        fortunate are so blessed.  || 12 ||   I have found the Lord, my
        Friend, my very Best Friend. He shall never break my heart. His
        dwelling is eternal; His weight cannot be weighed. Nanak has made
        Him the Friend of his soul.  || 13 ||   One's bad reputation

        || 14 ||   It is death to forget the Lord of the Universe. It
        is life to meditate on the Name of the Lord. The Lord is found
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, by pre-ordained
        destiny.  || 15 ||   The snake-charmer, by his spell, neutralizes
        the poison and leaves the snake without fangs. Just so, the Saints
        remove suffering; O Nanak, they are found by good karma.  || 16
        ||   The Lord is All-pervading everywhere; He gives Sanctuary
        to all living beings. The mind is touched by His Love, O Nanak,

        || 17 ||   My mind is pierced through by the Lord's Lotus
        Feet. I am blessed with total happiness. Holy people have been

        God in the Saadh Sangat, mortals are saved from the world-ocean.
        O Nanak, they shall never again be consigned to reincarnation.
        || 19 ||   People contemplate the Vedas, Puraanas and Shaastras.
        But by enshrining in their hearts the Naam, the Name of the One
        and Only Creator of the Universe, everyone can be saved. By great
        good fortune, O Nanak, a few cross over like this.  || 20 || 
        Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of Lord of the
        Universe, all one's generations are saved. It is obtained
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. O Nanak, by great
        good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is seen.  || 21
        ||   Abandon all your evil habits, and implant all Dharmic faith
        within. The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is obtained,
        O Nanak, by those who have such destiny written upon their foreheads.
        || 22 ||   God was, is, and shall always be. He sustains and
        destroys all. Know that these Holy people are true, O Nanak; they
        are in love with the Lord.  || 23 ||   The mortal is engrossed
        in sweet words and transitory pleasures which shall soon fade
        away. Disease, sorrow and separation afflict him; O Nanak, he
        never finds peace, even in dreams.  || 24 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">With Pen in Hand, the Unfathomable Lord writes
        the mortal's destiny upon his forehead. The Incomparably
        Beautiful Lord is involved with all. I cannot utter Your Praises
        with my mouth. Nanak is fascinated, gazing upon the Blessed Vision
        of Your Darshan. I am a sacrifice to You.  || 1 ||   Seated in
        the Society of the Saints, I chant the Lord's Praises.
        I dedicate all my adornments to Him, and give all this soul to
        Him. With hopeful yearning for Him, I have made the bed for my
        Husband. O Lord! If such good destiny is inscribed upon my forehead,
        then I shall find my Friend.  || 2 ||   O my companion, I have
        prepared everything: make-up, garlands and betel-leaves. I have
        embellished myself with the sixteen decorations, and applied the
        mascara to my eyes. If my Husband Lord comes to my home, then
        I obtain everything. <br>

      <p> O Lord! Without my Husband, all these adornments are useless.
        || 3 ||   Very fortunate is she, within whose home the Husband
        Lord abides. She is totally adorned and decorated; she is a happy
        soul-bride. I sleep in peace, without anxiety; the hopes of my
        mind have been fulfilled. O Lord! When my Husband came into the
        home of my heart, I obtained everything.  || 4 ||   My hope is
        so intense, that this hope alone should fulfill my hopes. When
        the True Guru becomes merciful, then I attain the Perfect Lord.
        My body is filled with so many demerits; I am covered with faults
        and demerits. O Lord! When the True Guru becomes Merciful, then
        the mind is held in place.  || 5 ||   Says Nanak, I have meditated
        on the Lord, Infinite and Endless. This world-ocean is so difficult
        to cross; the True Guru has carried me across. My comings and
        goings in reincarnation ended, when I met the Perfect Lord. O
        Lord! I have obtained the Ambrosial Nectar of the Name of the
        Lord from the True Guru.  || 6 ||   The lotus is in my hand; in
        the courtyard of my heart I abide in peace. O my companion, the
        Jewel is around my neck; beholding it, sorrow is taken away. I
        abide with the Lord of the World, the Treasury of Total Peace.
        O Lord! All wealth, spiritual perfection and the nine treasures
        are in His Hand.  || 7 ||   Those men who go out to enjoy other
        men's women shall suffer in shame. Those who steal the
        wealth of others - how can their guilt be concealed? Those
        who chant the Sacred Praises of the Lord save and redeem all their
        generations. O Lord! Those who listen and contemplate the Supreme
        Lord God become pure and holy.  || 8 ||   The sky above looks
        lovely, and the earth below is beautiful. Lightning flashes in
        the ten directions; I behold the Face of my Beloved. If I go searching
        in foreign lands, how can I find my Beloved? O Lord! If such destiny
        is inscribed upon my forehead, I am absorbed in the Blessed Vision
        of His Darshan.  || 9 ||   I have seen all places, but none can
        compare to You. The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, has
        established You; thus You are adorned and embellished. Ramdaspur
        is prosperous and thickly populated, and incomparably beautiful.
        O Lord! Bathing in the Sacred Pool of Raam Daas, the residues
        of sins are washed away, O Nanak.  || 10 ||   The sparrow-hawk
        is very smart; in its consciousness, it longs for the friendly
        rain. It longs for that, to which its breath of life is attached.
        It wanders depressed, from forest to forest, for the sake of a
        drop of water. O Lord! In just the same way, the humble servant
        of the Lord begs for the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Nanak is
        a sacrifice to him.  || 11 ||   The Consciousness of my Friend
        is incomparably beautiful. Its mystery cannot be known. One who
        purchases the priceless virtues realizes the essence of reality.
        When the consciousness is absorbed in the supreme consciousness,
        great joy and bliss are found. O Lord! When the fickle thieves
        are overcome, the true wealth is obtained.  || 12 ||   In a dream,
        I was lifted up; why didn't I grasp the hem of His Robe?
        Gazing upon the Beautiful Lord relaxing there, my mind was charmed
        and fascinated. I am searching for His Feet - tell me,
        where can I find Him? O Lord! Tell me how I can find my Beloved,
        O my companion.  || 13 ||   The eyes which do not see the Holy
        - those eyes are miserable. The ears which do not hear
        the Sound-current of the Naad - those ears might just as
        well be plugged. The tongue which does not chant the Naam ought
        to be cut out, bit by bit. O Lord! When the mortal forgets the
        Lord of the Universe, the Sovereign Lord King, he grows weaker
        day by day.  || 14 ||   The wings of the bumble bee are caught
        in the intoxicating fragrant petals of the lotus. With its limbs
        entangled in the petals, it loses its senses. </p>
