      <p> KAANRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  How may I obtain the Blessed Vision of
        Your Darshan?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I hope and thirst for Your
        wish-fulfilling image; my heart yearns and longs for You.  ||
        1 ||   The meek and humble Saints are like thirsty fish; the Saints
        of the Lord are absorbed in Him. I am the dust of the feet of
        the Lord's Saints. I dedicate my heart to them. God has
        become Merciful to me. Renouncing pride and leaving behind emotional
        attachment, O Nanak, one meets with the Dear Lord.  || 2 || 2
        || 35 ||   KAANRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Playful Lord imbues all
        with the Color of His Love. From the ant to the elephant, He is
        permeating and pervading all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Some go on
        fasts, make vows, and take pilgrimages to sacred shrines on the
        Ganges. They stand naked in the water, enduring hunger and poverty.
        They sit cross-legged, perform worship services and do good deeds.
        They apply religious symbols to their bodies, and ceremonial marks
        to their limbs. They read through the Shaastras, but they do not
        join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.  || 1 ||   They stubbornly
        practice ritualistic postures, standing on their heads. They are
        afflicted with the disease of egotism, and their faults are not
        covered up. They burn in the fire of sexual frustration, unresolved
        anger and compulsive desire. He alone is liberated, O Nanak, whose
        True Guru is Good.  || 2 || 3 || 36 || <br>

        That which God has done for me - how can I do that for
        Him in return? I make my heart a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You.  || 1 ||   First, I fall at the
        feet of the Saints; I meditate, meditate, lovingly attuned to
        You. O God, where is that Place, where You contemplate all Your

        I am meek and poor - I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord of

        Those who meditate on the Lord are saved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The world is a swamp of wickedness and corruption. The blind
        sinner has fallen into the ocean of emotional attachment and pride,
        bewildered by the entanglements of Maya. God Himself has taken
        me by the hand and lifted me up and out of it; save me, O Sovereign
        Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||   He is the Master of the masterless,
        the Supporting Lord of the Saints, the Neutralizer of millions
        of sins. My mind thirsts for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
        God is the Perfect Treasure of Virtue. O Nanak, sing and savor
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Kind and Compassionate Lord
        of the World.  || 2 || 2 || 41 ||   KAANRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Countless
        times, I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to that moment of peace,
        on that night when I was joined with my Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Mansions of gold, and beds of silk sheets - O sisters,
        I have no love for these.  || 1 ||   Pearls, jewels and countless
        pleasures, O Nanak, are useless and destructive without the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Even with only dry crusts of bread, and
        a hard floor on which to sleep, my life passes in peace and pleasure
        with my Beloved, O sisters.  || 2 || 3 || 42 ||   KAANRAA,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Give up your ego, and turn your face to God. Let your yearning
        mind call out, &quot;Guru, Guru&quot;. My Beloved is the Lover
        of Love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The bed of your household shall
        be cozy, and your courtyard shall be comfortable; shatter and
        break the bonds which tie you to the five thieves.  || 1 ||  
        You shall not come and go in reincarnation; you shall dwell in
        your own home deep within, and your inverted heart-lotus shall
        blossom forth. The turmoil of egotism shall be silenced. Nanak
        sings - he sings the Praises of God, the Ocean of Virtue.
        || 2 || 4 || 43 ||   KAANRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  NINTH HOUSE:  This
        is why you should chant and meditate on the Lord, O mind. The
        Vedas and the Saints say that the path is treacherous and difficult.
        You are intoxicated with emotional attachment and the fever of
        egotism.  ||  Pause  ||   Those who are imbued and intoxicated
        with the wretched Maya, suffer the pains of emotional attachment.
        || 1 ||   That humble being is saved, who chants the Naam; You
        Yourself save him. <br>

        ||   They are egotistical, self-centered and conceited, foolish,

        revealed; so focus your consciousness on His Bani.  || 2 ||  
        Hearing the Word of the Guru's Bani, my mind has been softened
        and saturated with it; my mind has returned to its own home deep
        within. The Unstruck Melody resonates and resounds there continuously;
        the stream of nectar trickles down constantly.  || 3 ||   Singing
        the Name of the One Lord each and every instant, and following
        the Guru's Teachings, the mind is absorbed in the Naam.
        Listening to the Naam, the mind is pleased with the Naam, and
        satisfied with the Naam.  || 4 ||   People wear lots of bracelets,
        glittering with gold; they wear all sorts of fine clothes. But
        without the Naam, they are all bland and insipid. They are born,
        only to die again, in the cycle of reincarnation.  || 5 ||   The
        veil of Maya is a thick and heavy veil, a whirlpool which destroys
        one's home. Sins and corrupt vices are totally heavy, like
        rusted slag. They will not let you cross over the poisonous and
        treacherous world-ocean.  || 6 ||   Let the Fear of God and neutral
        detachment be the boat; the Guru is the Boatman, who carries us
        across in the Word of the Shabad. Meeting with the Lord, the Name
        of the Lord, merge in the Lord, the Name of the Lord.  || 7 ||
        Attached to ignorance, people are falling asleep; attached to
        the Guru's spiritual wisdom, they awaken. O Nanak, by His
        Will, He makes us walk as He pleases.  || 8 || 1 ||   KAANRAA,
        FOURTH MEHL:  O mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and
        be carried across. Whoever chants and meditates on it is emancipated.
        Like Dhroo and Prahlaad, they merge in the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause

      <p> Mercy, mercy, mercy - O Dear Lord, please shower Your Mercy
        on me, and attach me to Your Name. Please be Merciful, and lead
        me to meet the True Guru; meeting the True Guru, I meditate on
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   The filth of egotism
        from countless incarnations sticks to me; joining the Sangat,
        the Holy Congregation, this filth is washed away. As iron is carried
        across if it is attached to wood, one who is attached to the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad finds the Lord. Joining the Society
        of the Saints, joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
        you shall come to receive the Sublime Essence of the Lord. But
        not joining the Sangat, and committing actions in egotistical
        pride, is like drawing out clean water, and throwing it in the
        mud.  || 3 ||   The Lord is the Protector and Saving Grace of
        His humble devotees. The Lord's Sublime Essence seems so
        sweet to these humble beings. Each and every instant, they are
        blessed with the Glorious Greatness of the Naam; through the Teachings
        of the True Guru, they are absorbed in Him.  || 4 ||   Bow forever
        in deep respect to the humble devotees; if you bow to those humble
        beings, you shall obtain the fruit of virtue. Those wicked enemies
        who slander the devotees are destroyed, like Harnaakhash.  ||
        5 ||   Brahma, the son of the lotus, and Vyaas, the son of the
        fish, practiced austere penance and were worshipped. Whoever is
        a devotee - worship and adore that person. Get rid of your
        doubts and superstitions.  || 6 ||   Do not be fooled by appearances
        of high and low social class. Suk Dayv bowed at the feet of Janak,
        and meditated. Even though Janak threw his left-overs and garbage
        on Suk Dayv's head, his mind did not waver, even for an
        instant.  || 7 ||   Janak sat upon his regal throne, and applied
        the dust of the nine sages to his forehead. Please shower Nanak
        with your Mercy, O my Lord and Master; make him the slave of Your
        slaves.  || 8 || 2 ||   KAANRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  O mind, follow
        the Guru's Teachings, and joyfully sing God's Praises.
        If my one tongue became hundreds of thousands and millions, I
        would meditate on Him millions and millions of times.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The serpent king chants and meditates on the Lord
        with his thousands of heads, but even by these chants, he cannot
        find the Lord's limits. You are Utterly Unfathomable, Inaccessible
        and Infinite. Through the Wisdom of the Guru's Teachings,
        the mind becomes steady and balanced.  || 1 ||   Those humble
        beings who meditate on You are noble and exalted. Meditating on
        the Lord, they are at peace. Bidur, the son of a slave-girl, was
        an untouchable, but Krishna hugged him close in His Embrace. 
        || 2 ||   Wood is produced from water, but by holding onto wood,
        one is saved from drowning. The Lord Himself embellishes and exalts
        His humble servants; He confirms His Innate Nature.  || 3 || 
        I am like a stone, or a piece of iron, heavy stone and iron;
        in the Boat of the Guru's Congregation, I am carried across,
        like Kabeer the weaver, who was saved in the Sat Sangat, the True
        Congregation. He became pleasing to the minds of the humble Saints.
        || 4 ||   Standing up, sitting down, rising up and walking on
        the path, I meditate. The True Guru is the Word, and the Word
        is the True Guru, who teaches the Path of Liberation.  || 5 ||
        By His Training, I find strength with each and every breath;
        now that I am trained and tamed, I meditate on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. <br>

      <p> By Guru's Grace, egotism is extinguished, and then, through
        the Guru's Teachings, I merge in the Naam.  || 6 ||   The
        True Guru is the Giver of the life of the soul, but the unfortunate
        ones do not love Him. This opportunity shall not come into their
        hands again; in the end, they will suffer in torment and regret.
        || 7 ||   If a good person seeks goodness for himself, he should
        bow low in humble surrender to the Guru. Nanak prays: please show
        kindness and compassion to me, O my Lord and Master, that I may
        apply the dust of the True Guru to my forehead.  || 8 || 3 ||
        KAANRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  O mind, be attuned to His Love, and
        sing. The Fear of God makes me fearless and immaculate; I am dyed
        in the color of the Guru's Teachings.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Those who are attuned to the Lord's Love remain balanced
        and detached forever; they live near the Lord, who comes into
        their house. If I am blessed with the dust of their feet, then
        I live. Granting His Grace, He Himself bestows it.  || 1 ||  
        Mortal beings are attached to greed and duality. Their minds are
        unripe and unfit, and will not accept the Dye of His Love. But
        their lives are transformed through the Word of the Guru's
        Teachings. Meeting with the Guru, the Primal Being, they are dyed
        in the color of His Love.  || 2 ||   There are ten organs of sense
        and action; the ten wander unrestrained. Under the influence of
        the three dispositions, they are not stable, even for an instant.
        Coming in contact with the True Guru, they are brought under control;
        then, salvation and liberation are attained.  || 3 ||   The One
        and Only Creator of the Universe is All-pervading everywhere.
        All shall once again merge into the One. His One Form has one,
        and many colors; He leads all according to His One Word.  || 4
        ||   The Gurmukh realizes the One and Only Lord; He is revealed
        to the Gurmukh. The Gurmukh goes and meets the Lord in His Mansion
        deep within; the Unstruck Word of the Shabad vibrates there. 
        || 5 ||   God created all the beings and creatures of the universe;
        He blesses the Gurmukh with glory. Without meeting the Guru, no
        one obtains the Mansion of His Presence. They suffer the agony
        of coming and going in reincarnation.  || 6 ||   For countless
        lifetimes, I have been separated from my Beloved; in His Mercy,
        the Guru has united me with Him. Meeting the True Guru, I have
        found absolute peace, and my polluted intellect blossoms forth.
        || 7 ||   O Lord, Har, Har, please grant Your Grace; O Life of
        the World, instill faith in the Naam within me. Nanak is the Guru,
        the Guru, the True Guru; I am immersed in the Sanctuary of the
        True Guru.  || 8 || 4 ||   KAANRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  O mind, walk
        on the Path of the Guru's Teachings. Just as the wild elephant
        is subdued by the prod, the mind is disciplined by the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The wandering
        mind wanders, roams and rambles in the ten directions; but the
        Guru holds it, and lovingly attunes it to the Lord. The True Guru
        implants the Word of the Shabad deep within the heart; the Ambrosial
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, trickles into the mouth.  || 1 ||
        The snakes are filled with poisonous venom; the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad is the antidote - place it in your
        mouth. Maya, the serpent, does not even approach one who is rid
        of the poison, and lovingly attuned to the Lord.  || 2 ||   The
        dog of greed is very powerful in the village of the body; the
        Guru strikes it and drives it out in an instant. <br>

      <p> Truth, contentment, righteousness and Dharma have settled there;
        in the village of the Lord, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        || 3 ||   The mortal beings are sinking in the swamp of emotional
        attachment; the Guru lifts them up, and saves them from sinking.
        Crying, &quot;Save me! Save me!&quot;, the humble come to His
        Sanctuary; the Guru reaches out His Hand, and lifts them up. 
        || 4 ||   The whole world is like a game in a dream, all a game.
        God plays and causes the game to be played. So earn the Profit
        of the Naam by following the Guru's Teachings; you shall
        go to the Court of the Lord in robes of honor.  || 5 ||   They
        act in egotism, and make others act in egotism; they collect and
        gather up the blackness of sin. And when death comes, they suffer
        in agony; they must eat what they have planted.  || 6 ||   O Saints,
        gather the Wealth of the Lord's Name; if you depart after
        packing these provisions, you shall be honored. So eat, spend,
        consume and give abundantly; the Lord will give - there
        will be no deficiency.  || 7 ||   The wealth of the Lord's
        Name is deep within the heart. In the Sanctuary of the Guru, this
        wealth is found. O Nanak, God has been kind and compassionate;
        He has blessed me. Removing pain and poverty, He has blended me
        with Himself.  || 8 || 5 ||   KAANRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  O mind,
        seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru, and meditate. Iron is transformed
        into gold by touching the philosopher's stone; it takes
        on its qualities.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The True Guru, the Great
        Primal Being, is the philosopher's stone. Whoever is attached
        to Him receives fruitful rewards. Just as Prahlaad was saved by
        the Guru's Teachings, the Guru protects the honor of His
        servant.  || 1 ||   The Word of the True Guru is the most Sublime
        and Noble Word. Through the Guru's Word, the Ambrosial
        Nectar is obtained. Ambreek the king was blessed with the status
        of immortality, meditating on the Word of the True Guru.  || 2
        ||   The Sanctuary, the Protection and Sanctuary of the True Guru
        is pleasing to the mind. It is sacred and pure - meditate
        on it. The True Guru has become Merciful to the meek and the poor;
        He has shown me the Path, the Way to the Lord.  || 3 ||   Those
        who enter the Sanctuary of the True Guru are firmly established;
        God comes to protect them. If someone aims an arrow at the Lord's
        humble servant, it will turn around and hit him instead.  || 4
        ||   Those who bathe in the Sacred Pool of the Lord, Har, Har,
        Har, Har, Har, are blessed with honor in His Court. Those who
        meditate on the Guru's Teachings, the Guru's Instructions,
        the Guru's Wisdom, are united in the Lord's Union;
        He hugs them close in His Embrace.  || 5 ||   The Guru's
        Word is the Sound-current of the Naad, The Guru's Word
        is the wisdom of the Vedas; coming in contact with the Guru, meditate
        on the Naam. In the Image of the Lord, Har, Har, one becomes the
        Embodiment of the Lord. The Lord makes His humble servant worthy
        of worship.  || 6 ||   The faithless cynic does not submit to
        the True Guru; the Lord makes the non-believer wander in confusion.
        The waves of greed are like packs of dogs. The poison of Maya
        sticks to the body-skeleton.  || 7 ||   The Lord's Name
        is the Saving Grace of the whole world; join the Sangat, and meditate
        on the Naam. O my God, please protect and preserve Nanak in the
        Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; save him, and let him merge
        in You.  || 8 || 6 ||  FIRST SET OF SIX  || <br>

        attached to the Naam, they are lovingly attuned to the One. I

        the Searcher of hearts, one's life becomes totally fruitful.

        the Lord is the Master of the senses, the Master of all faculties;
        through Him, we obtain all fruits and rewards.  || 2 ||   SHALOK,
        FOURTH MEHL:  O mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har; you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. You shall
        obtain the fruits that you desire, focusing your meditation on
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. All the residues of your
        sins and mistakes shall be wiped away, and you shall be rid of
        egotism and pride. The heart-lotus of the Gurmukh blossoms forth,
        recognizing God within every soul. O Lord God, please shower Your
        Mercy upon servant Nanak, that he may chant the Lord's
        Name.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        is Sacred and Immaculate. Chanting the Naam, pain is dispelled.
        God comes to abide in the minds of those who have such pre-ordained
        destiny. Those who walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru
        are rid of pain and poverty. No one finds the Lord by his own
        will; see this, and satisfy your mind. Servant Nanak is the slave
        of the slave of those who fall at the Feet of the True Guru.

      <p> You are pervading and permeating all places and interspaces, O
        Creator. You made all that has been made. You created the entire
        universe, with all its colors and shades; in so many ways and
        means and forms You formed it. O Lord of Light, Your Light is
        infused within all; You link us to the Guru's Teachings.
        They alone meet the True Guru, unto whom You are Merciful; O Lord,
        You instruct them in the Guru's Word. Let everyone chant
        the Name of the Lord, chant the Name of the Great Lord; all poverty,
        pain and hunger shall be taken away.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  The Ambrosial Nectar of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        is sweet; enshrine this Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord within your
        heart. The Lord God prevails in the Sangat, the Holy Congregation;
        reflect upon the Shabad and understand. Meditating on the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har, within the mind, the poison of egotism
        is eradicated. One who does not remember the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, shall totally lose this life in the gamble. By Guru's
        Grace, one remembers the Lord, and enshrines the Lord's
        Name within the heart. O servant Nanak, his face shall be radiant
        in the Court of the True Lord.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  To chant
        the Lord's Praise and His Name is sublime and exalted.
        This is the most excellent deed in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
        His Praises come through the Guru's Teachings and Instructions;
        wear the Necklace of the Lord's Name. Those who meditate
        on the Lord are very fortunate. They are entrusted with the Treasure
        of the Lord. Without the Name, no matter what people may do, they
        continue to waste away in egotism. Elephants can be washed and
        bathed in water, but they only throw dust on their heads again.
        O Kind and Compassionate True Guru, please unite me with the Lord,
        that the One Creator of the Universe may abide within my mind.
        Those Gurmukhs who listen to the Lord and believe in Him -
        servant Nanak salutes them.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord's
        Name is the most sublime and precious merchandise. The Primal
        Lord God is my Lord and Master. The Lord has staged His Play,
        and He Himself permeates it. The whole world deals in this merchandise.
        Your Light is the light in all beings, O Creator. All Your Expanse
        is True. All those who meditate on You become prosperous; through
        the Guru's Teachings, they sing Your Praises, O Formless
        Lord. Let everyone chant the Lord, the Lord of the World, the
        Lord of the Universe, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
        || 4 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  I have only one tongue, and
        the Glorious Virtues of the Lord God are Unapproachable and Unfathomable.
        I am ignorant - how can I meditate on You, Lord? You are
        Great, Unapproachable and Immeasurable. O Lord God, please bless
        me with that sublime wisdom, that I may fall at the Feet of the
        Guru, the True Guru. O Lord God, please lead me to the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, where even a sinner like myself may be
        saved. O Lord, please bless and forgive servant Nanak; please
        unite him in Your Union. O Lord, please be merciful and hear my
        prayer; I am a sinner and a worm - please save me!  ||
        1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  O Lord, Life of the World, please bless me
        with Your Grace, and lead me to meet the Guru, the Merciful True
        Guru. <br>

      <p> I am happy to serve the Guru; the Lord has become merciful to
        me. All my hopes and desires have been forgotten; my mind is rid
        of its worldly entanglements. The Guru, in His Mercy, implanted
        the Naam within me; I am enraptured with the Word of the Shabad.
        Servant Nanak has obtained the inexhaustible wealth; the Lord's
        Name is his wealth and property.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O Lord, You
        are the Greatest of the Great, the Greatest of the Great, the
        Most Lofty and Exalted of all, the Greatest of the Great. Those
        who meditate on the Infinite Lord, who meditate on the Lord, Har,
        Har, Har, are rejuvenated. Those who sing and listen to Your Praises,
        O my Lord and Master, have millions of sins destroyed. I know
        that those divine beings who follow the Guru's Teachings
        are just like You, Lord. They are the greatest of the great, so
        very fortunate. Let everyone meditate on the Lord, who was True
        in the primal beginning, and True throughout the ages; He is revealed
        as True here and now, and He shall be True forever and ever. Servant
        Nanak is the slave of His slaves.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:
        I meditate on my Lord, the Life of the World, the Lord, chanting
        the Guru's Mantra. The Lord is Unapproachable, Inaccessible
        and Unfathomable; the Lord, Har, Har, has spontaneously come to
        meet me. The Lord Himself is pervading each and every heart; the
        Lord Himself is Endless. The Lord Himself enjoys all pleasures;
        the Lord Himself is the Husband of Maya. The Lord Himself gives
        in charity to the whole world, and all the beings and creatures
        which He created. O Merciful Lord God, please bless me with Your
        Bountiful Gifts; the humble Saints of the Lord beg for them. O
        God of servant Nanak, please come and meet me; I sing the Songs
        of the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL: 
        The Name of the Lord God is my Best Friend. My mind and body are
        drenched with the Naam. All the hopes of the Gurmukh are fulfilled;
        servant Nanak is comforted, hearing the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord's Sublime Name is energizing
        and rejuvenating. The Immaculate Lord, the Primal Being, blossoms
        forth. Maya serves at the feet of those who chant and meditate
        on the Lord, Har, Har, day and night. The Lord always looks after
        and cares for all His beings and creatures; He is with all, near
        and far. Those whom the Lord inspires to understand, understand;
        the True Guru, God, the Primal Being, is pleased with them. Let
        everyone sing the Praise of the Lord of the Universe, the Lord,
        the Lord of the Universe, the Lord, the Lord of the Universe;
        singing the Praise of the Lord, one is absorbed in His Glorious
        Virtues.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  O mind, even in sleep,
        remember the Lord God; let yourself be intuitively absorbed into
        the Celestial State of Samaadhi. Servant Nanak's mind longs
        for the Lord, Har, Har. As the Guru pleases, he is absorbed into
        the Lord, O mother.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  I am in love with
        the One and Only Lord; the One Lord fills my consciousness. Servant
        Nanak takes the Support of the One Lord God; through the One,
        he obtains honor and salvation.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Panch
        Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds, vibrate with the Wisdom of the
        Guru's Teachings; by great good fortune, the Unstruck Melody
        resonates and resounds. I see the Lord, the Source of Bliss, everywhere;
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord of the
        Universe is revealed. From the primal beginning, and throughout
        the ages, the Lord has One Form. Through the Wisdom of the Guru's
        Teachings, I vibrate and meditate on the Lord God. <br>

      <p> O Merciful Lord God, please bless me with Your Bounty; O Lord
        God, please preserve and protect the honor of Your humble servant.
        Let everyone proclaim: Blessed is the Guru, the True Guru, the
        Guru, the True Guru; meeting Him, the Lord covers their faults
        and deficiencies.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  The sacred
        pool of devotional worship is filled to the brim and overflowing
        in torrents. Those who obey the True Guru, O servant Nanak, are
        very fortunate - they find it.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:
        The Names of the Lord, Har, Har, are countless. The Glorious
        Virtues of the Lord, Har, Har, cannot be described. The Lord,
        Har, Har, is Inaccessible and Unfathomable; how can the humble
        servants of the Lord be united in His Union? Those humble beings
        meditate and chant the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, but they
        do not attain even a tiny bit of His Worth. O servant Nanak, the
        Lord God is Inaccessible; the Lord has attached me to His Robe,
        and united me in His Union.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord is Inaccessible
        and Unfathomable. How will I see the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan? If He were a material object, then I could describe Him,
        but He has no form or feature. Understanding comes only when the
        Lord Himself gives understanding; only such a humble being sees
        it. The Sat Sangat, the True Congregation of the True Guru, is
        the school of the soul, where the Glorious Virtues of the Lord
        are studied. Blessed, blessed is the tongue, blessed is the hand,
        and blessed is the Teacher, the True Guru; meeting Him, the Account
        of the Lord is written.  || 8 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  The
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Ambrosial Nectar. Meditate on the
        Lord, with love for the True Guru. The Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har is Sacred and Pure. Chanting it and listening to it, pain
        is taken away. They alone worship and adore the Lord's
        Name, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny is written.
        Those humble beings are honored in the Court of the Lord; the
        Lord comes to abide in their minds. O servant Nanak, their faces
        are radiant. They listen to the Lord; their minds are filled with
        love.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        is the greatest treasure. The Gurmukhs obtain it. The True Guru
        comes to meet those who have such pre-ordained destiny written
        upon their foreheads. Their bodies and minds are cooled and soothed;
        peace and tranquility come to dwell in their minds. O Nanak, chanting
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, all poverty and pain is dispelled.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  I am a sacrifice, forever and ever, to those
        who have seen my Beloved True Guru. They alone meet my True Guru,
        who have such pre-ordaind destiny written upon their foreheads.
        I meditate on the Inaccessible Lord, according to the Guru's
        Teachings; God has no form or feature. Those who follow the Guru's
        Teachings and meditate on the Inaccessible Lord, merge with their
        Lord and Master and become one with Him. Let everyone proclaim
        out loud, the Name of the Lord, the Lord, the Lord; the profit
        of devotional worship of the Lord is blessed and sublime.  ||
        9 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord's Name is permeating
        and pervading all. Repeat the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam. The
        Lord is in the home of each and every soul. God created this play
        with its various colors and forms. The Lord, the Life of the World,
        dwells near at hand. <br>

      <p> The Guru, my Friend, has made this clear. They alone meet the
        Lord, the Lord God, their Lord and Master, whose love for the
        Lord is pre-ordained. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord; through the Word of the Guru's Teachings,
        chant it consciously with your mind.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL: 
        Seek the Lord God, your Best Friend; by great good fortune, He
        comes to dwell with the very fortunate ones. Through the Perfect
        Guru, He is revealed, O Nanak, and one is lovingly attuned to
        the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Blessed, blessed, beauteous and
        fruitful is that moment, when service to the Lord becomes pleasing
        to the mind. So proclaim the story of the Lord, O my GurSikhs;
        speak the Unspoken Speech of my Lord God. How can I attain Him?
        How can I see Him? My Lord God is All-knowing and All-seeing.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, the Lord reveals
        Himself; we merge in absorption in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        Nanak is a sacrifice unto those who meditate on the Lord of Nirvaanaa.
        || 10 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  One's eyes are anointed
        by the Lord God, when the Guru bestows the ointment of spiritual
        wisdom. I have found God, my Best Friend; servant Nanak is intuitively
        absorbed into the Lord.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The Gurmukh is
        filled with peace and tranquility deep within. His mind and body
        are absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He thinks of the
        Naam, and reads the Naam; he remains lovingly attuned to the Naam.
        He obtains the Treasure of the Naam, and is rid of anxiety. Meeting
        with the True Guru, the Naam wells up, and all hunger and thirst
        depart. O Nanak, one who is imbued with the Naam, gathers the
        Naam in his lap.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You Yourself created the
        world, and You Yourself control it. Some are self-willed manmukhs
        - they lose. Others are united with the Guru - they
        win. The Name of the Lord, the Lord God is Sublime. The fortunate
        ones chant it, through the Word of the Guru's Teachings.
        All pain and poverty are taken away, when the Guru bestows the
        Lord's Name. Let everyone serve the Enticing Enticer of
        the Mind, the Enticer of the World, who created the world, and
        controls it all.  || 11 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  The disease
        of egotism is deep within the mind; the self-willed manmukhs and
        the evil beings are deluded by doubt. O Nanak, the disease is
        cured only by meeting with the True Guru, the Holy Friend.  ||
        1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  My mind and body are embellished and exalted,
        when I behold the Lord with my eyes. O Nanak, meeting with that
        God, I live, hearing His Voice.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Creator
        is the Lord of the World, the Master of the Universe, the Infinite
        Primal Immeasurable Being. Meditate on the Lord's Name,
        O my GurSikhs; the Lord is Sublime, the Lord's Name is
        Invaluable. Those who meditate on Him in their hearts, day and
        night, merge with the Lord - there is no doubt about it.
        By great good fortune, they join the Sangat, the Holy Congregation,
        and speak the Word of the Guru, the Perfect True Guru. Let everyone
        meditate on the Lord, the Lord, the All-pervading Lord, by which
        all disputes and conflicts with Death are ended.  || 12 ||   SHALOK,
        FOURTH MEHL:  The humble servant of the Lord chants the Name,
        Har, Har. The foolish idiot shoots arrows at him. O Nanak, the
        humble servant of the Lord is saved by the Love of the Lord. <br>

      <p> The arrow is turned around, and kills the one who shot it.  ||
        1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The eyes which are attracted by the Lord's
        Love behold the Lord through the Name of the Lord. If they gaze
        upon something else, O servant Nanak, they ought to be gouged
        out.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Infinite Lord totally permeates the
        water, the land and the sky. He cherishes and sustains all beings
        and creatures; whatever He does comes to pass. Without Him, we
        have no mother, father, children, sibling or friend. He is permeating
        and pervading deep within each and every heart; let everyone meditate
        on Him. Let all chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
        World, who is manifest all over the world.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,
        FOURTH MEHL:  Those Gurmukhs who meet as friends are blessed
        with the Lord God's Love. O servant Nanak, praise the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord; you shall go to His court in joyous high
        spirits.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Lord, You are the Great Giver
        of all; all beings are Yours. They all worship You in adoration;
        You bless them with Your Bounty, O Beloved. The Generous Lord,
        the Great Giver reaches out with His Hands, and the rain pours
        down on the world. The corn germinates in the fields; contemplate
        the Lord's Name with love. Servant Nanak begs for the Gift
        of the Support of the Name of his Lord God.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        The desires of the mind are satisfied, meditating on the Ocean
        of Peace. Worship and adore the Feet of the Lord, through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, the jewel mine. Joining the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one is saved, and the Decree
        of Death is torn up. The treasure of this human life is won, meditating
        on the Lord of Detachment. Let everyone seek the Sanctuary of
        the True Guru; let the black spot of pain, the scar of suffering,
        be erased.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  I was seeking, searching
        for my Friend, but my Friend is right here with me. O servant
        Nanak, the Unseen is not seen, but the Gurmukh is given to see
        Him.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  O Nanak, I am in love with the True
        Lord; I cannot survive without Him. Meeting the True Guru, the
        Perfect Lord is found, and the tongue savors His Sublime Essence.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Some sing, some listen, and some speek and
        preach. The filth and pollution of countless lifetimes is washed
        away, and the wishes of the mind are fulfilled. Coming and going
        in reincarnation ceases, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        They save themselves, and save their companions; they save all
        their generations as well. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to those
        who are pleasing to my Lord God.  || 15 || 1 ||  SUDH  || <br>
