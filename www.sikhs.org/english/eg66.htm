      <p> <font color="#000000">The Jewel of the Lord's Name abides
        within my heart; the Guru has placed His hand on my forehead.
        The sins and pains of countless incarnations have been cast out.
        The Guru has blessed me with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and
        my debt has been paid off.  || 1 ||   O my mind, vibrate the Lord's
        Name, and all your affairs shall be resolved. The Perfect Guru
        has implanted the Lord's Name within me; without the Name,
        life is useless.  ||  Pause  ||   Without the Guru, the self-willed
        manmukhs are foolish and ignorant; they are forever entangled
        in emotional attachment to Maya. They never serve the feet of
        the Holy; their lives are totally useless.  || 2 ||   Those who
        serve at the feet of the Holy, the feet of the Holy, their lives
        are made fruitful, and they belong to the Lord. Make me the slave
        of the slave of the slaves of the Lord; bless me with Your Mercy,
        O Lord of the Universe.  || 3 ||   I am blind, ignorant and totally
        without wisdom; how can I walk on the Path? I am blind -
        O Guru, please let me grasp the hem of Your robe, so that servant
        Nanak may walk in harmony with You.  || 4 || 1 ||   JAITSREE,
        FOURTH MEHL:  A jewel or a diamond may be very valuable and heavy,
        but without a purchaser, it is worth only straw. When the Holy
        Guru, the Purchaser, saw this jewel, He purchased it for hundreds
        of thousands of dollars.  || 1 ||   The Lord has kept this jewel
        hidden within my mind. The Lord, merciful to the meek, led me
        to meet the Holy Guru; meeting the Guru, I came to appreciate
        this jewel.  ||  Pause  ||   The rooms of the self-willed manmukhs
        are dark with ignorance; in their homes, the jewel is not visible.
        Those fools die, wandering in the wilderness, eating the poison
        of the snake, Maya.  || 2 ||   O Lord, Har, Har, let me meet the
        humble, holy beings; O Lord, keep me in the Sanctuary of the Holy.
        O Lord, make me Your own; O God, Lord and Master, I have hurried
        to Your side.  || 3 ||   What Glorious Virtues of Yours can I
        speak and describe? You are great and unfathomable, the Greatest
        Being. The Lord has bestowed His Mercy on servant Nanak; <br>

      <p> He has saved the sinking stone.  || 4 || 2 ||   JAITSREE,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  I am Your child; I know nothing about Your state and extent;
        I am foolish, idiotic and ignorant. O Lord, shower me with Your
        Mercy; bless me with an enlightened intellect; I am foolish -
        make me clever.  || 1 ||   My mind is lazy and sleepy. The Lord,
        Har, Har, has led me to meet the Holy Guru; meeting the Holy,
        the shutters have been opened wide.  ||  Pause  ||   O Guru, each
        and every instant, fill my heart with love; the Name of my Beloved
        is my breath of life. Without the Name, I would die; the Name
        of my Lord and Master is to me like the drug to the addict.  ||
        2 ||   Those who enshrine love for the Lord within their minds
        fulfill their pre-ordained destiny. I worship their feet, each
        and every instant; the Lord seems very sweet to them.  || 3 ||
        My Lord and Master, Har, Har, has showered His Mercy upon His
        humble servant; separated for so long, he is now re-united with
        the Lord. Blessed, blessed is the True Guru, who has implanted
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord within me; servant Nanak is a sacrifice
        to Him.  || 4 || 3 ||   JAITSREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  I have found
        the True Guru, my Friend, the Greatest Being. Love and affection
        for the Lord has blossomed forth. Maya, the snake, has seized
        the mortal; through the Word of the Guru, the Lord neutralizes
        the venom.  || 1 ||   My mind is attached to the sublime essence
        of the Lord's Name. The Lord has purified the sinners,
        uniting them with the Holy Guru; now, they taste the Lord's
        Name, and the sublime essence of the Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   Blessed,
        blessed is the good fortune of those who meet the Holy Guru; meeting
        with the Holy, they lovingly center themselves in the state of
        absolute absorption. The fire of desire within them is quenched,
        and they find peace; they sing the Glorious Praises of the Immaculate
        Lord.  || 2 ||   Those who do not obtain the Blessed Vision of
        the True Guru's Darshan, have misfortune pre-ordained for
        them. In the love of duality, they are consigned to reincarnation
        through the womb, and they pass their lives totally uselessly.
        || 3 ||   O Lord, please, bless me with pure understanding, that
        I may serve the Feet of the Holy Guru; the Lord seems sweet to
        me. Servant Nanak begs for the dust of the feet of the Holy; O
        Lord, be Merciful, and bless me with it.  || 4 || 4 ||   JAITSREE,
        FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord's Name does not abide within their
        hearts - their mothers should have been sterile. These
        bodies wander around, forlorn and abandoned, without the Name;
        their lives waste away, and they die, crying out in pain.  ||
        1 ||   O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the Lord within
        you. The Merciful Lord God, Har, Har, has showered me with His
        Mercy; the Guru has imparted spiritual wisdom to me, and my mind
        has been instructed.  ||  Pause  ||   In this Dark Age of Kali
        Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise brings the most noble
        and exalted status; the Lord is found through the True Guru. I
        am a sacrifice to my True Guru, who has revealed the Lord's
        hidden Name to me.  || 2 ||   By great good fortune, I obtained
        the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy; it removes all
        stains of sin. <br>

      <p> I have found the True Guru, the great, all-knowing King; He has
        shared with me the many Glorious Virtues of the Lord.  || 3 ||
        Those, unto whom the Lord, the Life of the world, has shown
        Mercy, enshrine Him within their hearts, and cherish Him in their
        minds. The Righteous Judge of Dharma, in the Court of the Lord,
        has torn up my papers; servant Nanak's account has been
        settled.  || 4 || 5 ||   JAITSREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  In the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, I found the Holy, by great good fortune;
        my restless mind has been quieted. The unstruck melody ever vibrates
        and resounds; I have taken in the sublime essence of the Lord's
        Ambrosial Nectar, showering down.  || 1 ||   O my mind, chant
        the Name of the Lord, the beauteous Lord. The True Guru has drenched
        my mind and body with the Love of the Lord, who has met me and
        lovingly embraced me.  ||  Pause  ||   The faithless cynics are
        bound and gagged in the chains of Maya; they are actively engaged,
        gathering in the poisonous wealth. They cannot spend this in harmony
        with the Lord, and so they must endure the pain which the Messenger
        of Death inflicts upon their heads.  || 2 ||   The Holy Guru has
        dedicated His Being to the Lord's service; with great devotion,
        apply the dust of His feet to your face. In this world and the
        next, you shall receive the Lord's honor, and your mind
        shall be imbued with the permanent color of the Lord's
        Love.  || 3 ||   O Lord, Har, Har, please unite me with the Holy;
        compared to these Holy people, I am just a worm. Servant Nanak
        has enshrined love for the feet of the Holy Guru; meeting with
        this Holy One, my foolish, stone-like mind has blossomed forth
        in lush profusion.  || 4 || 6 || <br>

        The Lord, the Slayer of demons, is my breath of life. His Ambrosial

        Implant within yourself devotion to the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har;
        sincerely dedicate yourself to the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 1 ||   Meditate on the Name of the Merciful Lord, Har, Har.
        WIth love, forever sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Dance
        to the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har; meet with the Sat Sangat,

      <p> O Lord, Har, Har, be merciful to me, and lead me to meet the Guru;
        meeting the Guru, a sincere yearning for the Lord wells up in
        me.  || 3 ||   Praise Him, the unfathomable and inaccessible Lord.
        Each and every moment, sing the Lord's Name. Be merciful,
        and meet me, O Guru, Great Giver; Nanak yearns for the Lord's
        devotional worship.  || 4 || 2 || 8 ||   JAITSREE,  FOURTH MEHL:
        With love and energetic affection, praise the Lord, the storehouse
        of Nectar. My mind is drenched with the Lord's Name, and
        so it earns this profit. Each and every moment, worship Him in
        devotion, day and night; through the Guru's Teachings,
        sincere love and devotion well up.  || 1 ||   Chant the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord of the Universe, Har, Har. Conquering mind
        and body, I have earned the profit of the Shabad. Through the
        Guru's Teachings, the five demons are over-powered, and
        the mind and body are filled with a sincere yearning for the Lord.
        || 2 ||   The Name is a jewel - chant the Lord's
        Name. Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and forever earn
        this profit. O Lord, merciful to the meek, be kind to me, and
        bless me with sincere longing for the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 3 ||   Meditate on the Lord  of the world - meditate
        within your mind. The Lord of the Universe, Har, Har, is the only
        real profit in this world. Blessed, blessed, is my Great Lord
        and Master God; O Nanak, meditate on Him, worship Him with sincere
        love and devotion.  || 4 || 3 || 9 ||   JAITSREE,  FOURTH MEHL:
        He Himself is the Yogi, and the way throughout the ages. The
        Fearless Lord Himself is absorbed in Samaadhi. He Himself, all
        by Himself, is all-pervading; He Himself blesses us with sincere
        love for the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   He Himself
        is the lamp, and the Light pervading all the worlds. He Himself
        is the True Guru; He Himself churns the ocean. He Himself churns
        it, churning up the essence; meditating on the jewel of the Naam,
        sincere love comes to the surface.  || 2 ||   O my companions,
        let us meet and join together, and sing His Glorious Praises.
        As Gurmukh, chant the Naam, and earn the profit of the Lord's
        Name. Devotional worship of the Lord, Har, Har, has been implanted
        within me; it is pleasing to my mind. The Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, brings a sincere love.  || 3 ||   He Himself is supremely
        wise, the greatest King. As Gurmukh, purchase the merchandise
        of the Naam. O Lord God, Har, Har, bless me with such a gift,
        that Your Glorious Virtues seem pleasing to me; Nanak is filled
        with sincere love and yearning for the Lord.  || 4 || 4 || 10
        ||   JAITSREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True
        Congregation, and associating with the Guru, the Gurmukh gathers
        in the merchandise of the Naam. O Lord, Har, Har, Destroyer of
        demons, have mercy upon me; bless me with a sincere yearning to
        join the Sat Sangat.  || 1 ||   Let me hear with my ears the Banis,
        the Hymns, in praise of the Lord; be merciful, and let me meet
        the True Guru. I sing His Glorious Praises, I speak the Bani of
        His Word; chanting His Glorious Praises, a sincere yearning for
        the Lord wells up.  || 2 ||   I have tried visiting all the sacred
        shrines of pilgrimage, fasting, ceremonial feasts and giving to
        charities. They do not measure up to the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har. The Lord's Name is unweighable, utterly heavy in weight;
        through the Guru's Teachings, a sincere yearning to chant
        the Name has welled up in me.  || 3 ||   All good karma and righteous
        living are found in meditation on the Lord's Name. It washes
        away the stains of sins and mistakes. Be merciful to meek, humble
        Nanak; bless him with sincere love and yearning for the Lord.

        tell me, tell me! I am wonder-struck, hearing the many reports
        of Him; tell them to me, O my happy sister soul-brides.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Some say that He is beyond the world -
        totally beyond it, while others say that He is totally within
        it. His color cannot be seen, and His pattern cannot be discerned.
        O happy soul-brides, tell me the truth!  || 1 ||   He is pervading
        everywhere, and He dwells in each and every heart; He is not stained
        - He is unstained. Says Nanak, listen, O people: He dwells
        upon the tongues of the Saints.  || 2 || 1 || 2 ||   JAITSREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I am calmed, calmed and soothed, hearing of God.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I dedicate my soul, my breath of life, my
        mind, body and everything to Him: I behold God near, very near.
        || 1 ||   Beholding God, the inestimable, infinite and Great
        Giver, I cherish Him in my mind.  || 2 ||   Whatever I wish for,
        I receive; my hopes and desires are fulfilled, meditating on God.
        || 3 ||   By Guru's Grace, God dwells in Nanak's
        mind; he never suffers or grieves, having realized God.  || 4
        || 2 || 3 ||   JAITSREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I seek my Friend the Lord.
        In each and every home, sing the sublime songs of rejoicing; He
        abides in each and every heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In good
        times, worship and adore Him; in bad times, worship and adore
        Him; do not ever forget Him. Chanting the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, the light of millions of suns shines forth, and the darkness
        of doubt is dispelled.  || 1 ||   In all the spaces and interspaces,
        everywhere, whatever we see is Yours. One who finds the Society
        of the Saints, O Nanak, is not consigned to reincarnation again.

      <p> <font color="#000000">Now, I have found peace, bowing before the
        Guru. I have abandoned cleverness, quieted my anxiety, and renounced
        my egotism.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When I looked, I saw that everyone
        was enticed by emotional attachment; then, I hurried to the Guru's
        Sanctuary. In His Grace, the Guru engaged me in the Lord's
        service, and then, the Messenger of Death gave up pursuing me.
        || 1 ||   I swam across the ocean of fire, when I met the Saints,
        through great good fortune. O servant Nanak, I have found total
        peace; my consciousness is attached to the Lord's feet.
        || 2 || 1 || 5 ||   JAITSREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Within my mind, I
        cherish and meditate on the True Guru. He has implanted within
        me spiritual wisdom and the Mantra of the Lord's Name;
        Dear God has shown mercy to me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Death's
        noose and its mighty entanglements have vanished, along with the
        fear of death. I have come to the Sanctuary of the Merciful Lord,
        the Destroyer of pain; I am holding tight to the Support of His
        feet.  || 1 ||   The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, has
        assumed the form of a boat, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
        I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, and my doubts are shattered;
        says Nanak, I can bear the unbearable.  || 2 || 2 || 6 ||   JAITSREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  One who has the Lord of the Universe as his help
        and support is blessed with all peace, poise and bliss; no afflictions
        cling to him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He appears to keep company
        with everyone, but he remains detached, and Maya does not cling
        to him. He is absorbed in love of the One Lord; he understands
        the essence of reality, and he is blessed with wisdom by the True
        Guru.  || 1 ||   Those whom the Lord and Master blesses with His
        kindness, compassion and mercy are the sublime and sanctified
        Saints. Associating with them, Nanak is saved; with love and exuberant
        joy, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 2 || 3 ||
        7 ||   JAITSREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord of the Universe is my
        existence, my breath of life, wealth and beauty. The ignorant
        are totally intoxicated with emotional attachment; in this darkness,
        the Lord is the only lamp.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Fruitful is the
        Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Beloved God; Your lotus feet
        are incomparably beautiful! So many times, I bow in reverence
        to Him, offering my mind as incense to Him.  || 1 ||   Exhausted,
        I have fallen at Your Door, O God; I am holding tight to Your
        Support. Please, lift Your humble servant Nanak up, out of the
        pit of fire of the world.  || 2 || 4 || 8 ||   JAITSREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  If only someone would unite me with the Lord! I hold tight
        to His feet, and utter sweet words with my tongue; I make my breath
        of life an offering to Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I make my mind
        and body into pure little gardens, and irrigate them with the
        sublime essence of the Lord. I am drenched with this sublime essence
        by His Grace, and the powerful hold of Maya's corruption
        has been broken.  || 1 || <br>

        the innocent; I keep my consciousness focused on You. Bless me
        with the gifts of the state of fearlessness, and meditative remembrance,
        Lord and Master; O Nanak, God is the Breaker of bonds.  || 2 ||
        5 || 9 ||   JAITSREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The sparrow-hawk longs for
        the rain to fall. O God, ocean of mercy, shower Your mercy on
        me, that I may yearn for loving devotional worship of the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The chakvi duck does not desire many comforts,
        but it is filled with bliss upon seeing the dawn. The fish cannot
        survive any other way - without water, it dies.  || 1 ||
        I am a helpless orphan - I seek Your Sanctuary, O My
        Lord and Master; please bless me with Your mercy. Nanak worships
        and adores the Lord's lotus feet; without Him, there is
        no other at all.  || 2 || 6 || 10 ||   JAITSREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Lord, my very breath of life, abides in my mind and body.
        Bless me with Your mercy, and unite me with the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, O perfect, all-knowing Lord God.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Those, unto whom You give the intoxicating herb
        of Your Love, drink in the supreme sublime essence. I cannot describe
        their value; what power do I have?  || 1 ||   The Lord attaches
        His humble servants to the hem of His robe, and they swim across
        the world-ocean. Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance
        on God, peace is obtained; Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of Your Door.
        || 2 || 7 || 11 ||   JAITSREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  After wandering
        through so many incarnations, I have come to Your Sanctuary. Save
        me - lift my body up out of the deep, dark pit of the world,
        and attach me to Your feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I do not know
        anything about spiritual wisdom, meditation or karma, and my way
        of life is not clean and pure. Please attach me to the hem of
        the robe of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; help me
        to cross over the terrible river.  || 1 ||   Comforts, riches
        and the sweet pleasures of Maya - do not implant these
        within your mind. Slave Nanak is satisfied and satiated by the
        Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; his only ornamentation
        is the love of the Lord's Name.  || 2 || 8 || 12 ||   JAITSREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  O humble servants of the Lord, remember the Lord
        in meditation within your heart. Misfortune does not even approach
        the Lord's humble servant; the works of His slave are perfectly
        fulfilled.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Millions of obstacles are removed,
        by serving the Lord, and one enters into the eternal dwelling
        of the Lord of the Universe. The Lord's devotee is very
        fortunate; he has absolutely no fear. Even the Messenger of Death
        pays homage to him.  || 1 ||   Forsaking the Lord of the world,
        he does other deeds, but these are temporary and transitory. Grasp
        the Lord's lotus feet, and hold them in your heart, O Nanak;
        you shall obtain absolute peace and bliss.  || 2 || 9 || 13 || <br>

        Protection of Your Sanctuary, O Lord, ocean of mercy.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I am a great sinner, foolish and greedy; but now,
        at last, I have grown weary of committing sins. I cannot forget
        the fear of dying; this anxiety is consuming my body.  || 1 ||
        I have been trying to liberate myself, running around in the
        ten directions. The pure, immaculate Lord abides deep within my
        heart, but I do not understand the secret of His mystery.  ||
        2 ||   I have no merit, and I know nothing about meditation or
        austerities; what should I do now? O Nanak, I am exhausted; I
        seek the shelter of Your Sanctuary; O God, please bless me with
        the gift of fearlessness.  || 3 || 2 ||   JAITSREE,  NINTH MEHL:
        O mind, embrace true contemplation. Without the Lord's
        Name, know that this whole world is false.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The Yogis are tired of searching for Him, but they have not
        found His limit. You must understand that the Lord and Master
        is near at hand, but He has no form or feature.  || 1 ||   The
        Naam, the Name of the Lord is purifying in the world, and yet
        you never remember it. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the

        to meet with the Lord, my Friend.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  Listen,
        O my intimate friend - I have just one prayer to make.
        I have been wandering around, searching for that enticing, sweet
        Beloved. Whoever leads me to my Beloved - I would cut off
        my head and offer it to him, even if I were granted the Blessed
        Vision of His Darshan for just an instant. My eyes are drenched
        with the Love of my Beloved; without Him, I do not have even a
        moment's peace. My mind is attached to the Lord, like the

        Servant Nanak has found the Perfect Guru; his thirst is totally
        quenched.  || 1 ||   O intimate friend, my Beloved has all these
        loving companions; I cannot compare to any of them. O intimate
        friend, each of them is more beautiful than the others; who could
        consider me? Each of them is more beautiful than the others; countless
        are His lovers, constantly enjoying bliss with Him. Beholding
        them, desire wells up in my mind; when will I obtain the Lord,
        the treasure of virtue? I dedicate my mind to those who please
        and attract my Beloved. Says Nanak, hear my prayer, O happy soul-brides;

        Beloved, who eradicate self-conceit; such is the good destiny
        written on their foreheads. Taking me by the arm, the Lord and

        demerits. She, whom You have adorned with the necklace of virtue,

        us.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  Save me, any way You can; O Lord God,
        I am Yours. My demerits are uncountable; how many of them should
        I count? The sins and crimes I committed are countless; day by
        day, I continually make mistakes. I am intoxicated by emotional
        attachment to Maya, the treacherous one; by Your Grace alone can
        I be saved. Secretly, I commit hideous sins of corruption, even
        though God is the nearest of the near. Prays Nanak, shower me
        with Your Mercy, Lord, and lift me up, out of the whirlpool of
        the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||   SHALOK:  Countless are
        His virtues; they cannot be enumerated. God's Name is lofty
        and exalted. This is Nanak's humble prayer, to bless the
        homeless with a home.  || 2 ||   CHHANT:  There is no other place
        at all - where else should I go? Twenty-four hours a day,
        with my palms pressed together, I meditate on God. Meditating
        forever on my God, I receive the fruits of my mind's desires.
        Renouncing pride, attachment, corruption and duality, I lovingly
        center my attention on the One Lord. Dedicate your mind and body
        to God; eradicate all your self-conceit. Prays Nanak, shower me
        with Your mercy, Lord, that I may be absorbed in Your True Name.
        || 2 ||   SHALOK:  O mind, meditate on the One, who holds everything
        in His hands. Gather the wealth of the Lord's Name; O Nanak,
        it shall always be with You.  || 3 ||   CHHANT:  God is our only
        True Friend; there is not any other. In the places and interspaces,
        in the water and on the land, He Himself is pervading everywhere.
        He is totally permeating the water, the land and the sky; God
        is the Great Giver, the Lord and Master of all. The Lord of the
        world, the Lord of the universe has no limit; His Glorious Virtues
        are unlimited - how can I count them? I have hurried to
        the Sanctuary of the Lord Master, the Bringer of peace; without
        Him, there is no other at all. <br>

      <p> Prays Nanak, that being, unto whom the Lord shows mercy -
        he alone obtains the Naam.  || 3 ||   SHALOK:  Whatever I wish
        for, that I receive. Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        Nanak has found total peace.  || 4 ||   CHHANT:  My mind is now
        emancipated; I have joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy. As Gurmukh, I chant the Naam, and my light has merged into
        the Light. Remembering the Lord's Name in meditation, my
        sins have been erased; the fire has been extinguished, and I am
        satisfied. He has taken me by the arm, and blessed me with His
        kind mercy; He has accepted me His own. The Lord has hugged me
        in His embrace, and merged me with Himself; the pains of birth
        and death have been burnt away. Prays Nanak, He has blessed me
        with His kind mercy; in an instant, He unites me with Himself.
        || 4 || 2 ||   JAITSREE,  CHHANT,  FIFTH MEHL:  The world is
        like a temporary way-station, but it is filled with pride. People
        commit countless sins; they are dyed in the color of the love
        of Maya. In greed, emotional attachment and egotism, they are
        drowning; they do not even think of dying. Children, friends,
        worldly occupations and spouses - they talk of these things,
        while their lives are passing away. When their pre-ordained days
        have run their course, O mother, they behold the Messengers of
        the Righteous Judge of Dharma, and they suffer. The karma of their
        past deeds cannot be erased, O Nanak, if they have not earned
        the wealth of the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   He makes all
        sorts of efforts, but he does not sing the Lord's Name.
        He wanders around in countless incarnations; he dies, only to
        be born again. As beasts, birds, stones and trees - their
        number cannot be known. As are the seeds he plants, so are the
        pleasures he enjoys; he receives the consequences of his own actions.
        He loses the jewel of this human life in the gamble, and God is
        not pleased with him at all. Prays Nanak, wandering in doubt,
        he does not find any rest, even for an instant.  || 2 ||   Youth
        has passed, and old age has taken its place. The hands tremble,
        the head shakes, and the eyes do not see. The eyes do not see,
        without vibrating and meditating on the Lord; he must leave behind
        the attractions of Maya, and depart. He burnt his mind and body
        for his relatives, but now, they do not listen to him, and they
        throw dust on his head. Love for the infinite, Perfect Lord does
        not abide in his mind, even for an instant. Prays Nanak, the fort
        of paper is false - it is destroyed in an instant.  ||
        3 ||   Nanak has come to the Sanctuary of the Lord's lotus
        feet. God Himself has carried Him across the impassable, terrifying
        world-ocean. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        I vibrate and meditate on the Lord; God has made me His own, and
        saved me. The Lord has approved of me, and blessed me with His
        Name; He did not take anything else into consideration. I have
        found the infinite Lord and Master, the treasure of virtue, which
        my mind had yearned for. Prays Nanak, I am satisfied forever;
        I have eaten the food of the Lord's Name.  || 4 || 2 ||

      <p> O Nanak, He is the Destroyer of sins, the Lord of the universe.
        || 1 ||   See, hear, speak and implant the True Lord within your
        mind. He is all-pervading, permeating everywhere; O Nanak, be
        absorbed in the Lord's Love.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Sing the
        Praise of the One, the Immaculate Lord; He is contained within
        all. The Cause of causes, the Almighty Lord God; whatever He wills,
        comes to pass. In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes;
        without Him, there is no other. He pervades the continents, solar
        systems, nether worlds, islands and all worlds. He alone understands,
        whom the Lord Himself instructs; he alone is a pure and unstained
        being.  || 1 ||   SHALOK:  Creating the soul, the Lord places
        this creation in the womb of the mother. With each and every breath,
        it meditates in remembrance on the Lord, O Nanak; it is not consumed
        by the great fire.  || 1 ||   With its head down, and feet up,
        it dwells in that slimy place. O Nanak, how could we forget the
        Master? Through His Name, we are saved.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  From
        egg and sperm, you were conceived, and placed in the fire of the
        womb. Head downwards, you abided restlessly in that dark, dismal,
        terrible hell. Remembering the Lord in meditation, you were not
        burnt; enshrine Him in your heart, mind and body. In that treacherous
        place, He protected and preserved you; do not forget Him, even
        for an instant. Forgetting God, you shall never find peace; you
        shall forfeit your life, and depart.  || 2 ||   SHALOK:  He grants
        our hearts' desires, and fulfills all our hopes. He destroys
        pain and suffering; remember God in meditation, O Nanak -
        He is not far away.  || 1 ||   Love Him, with whom you enjoy all
        pleasures. Do not forget that Lord, even for an instant; O Nanak,
        He fashioned this beautiful body.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He gave
        you your soul, breath of life, body and wealth; He gave you pleasures
        to enjoy. He gave you households, mansions, chariots and horses;
        He ordained your good destiny. He gave you your children, spouse,
        friends and servants; God is the all-powerful Great Giver. Meditating
        in remembrance on the Lord, the body and mind are rejuvenated,
        and sorrow departs. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        chant the Praises of the Lord, and all your sickness shall vanish.
        || 3 ||   SHALOK:  For his family, he works very hard; for the
        sake of Maya, he makes countless efforts. But without loving devotional
        worship of the Lord, O Nanak, he forgets God, and then, he is
        a mere ghost.  || 1 ||   That love shall break, which is established
        with any other than the Lord. O Nanak, that way of life is true,
        which inspires love of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Forgetting
        Him, one's body turns to dust, and everyone calls him a
        ghost. And those, with whom he was so much in love - they
        do not let him stay in their home, even for an instant. Practicing
        exploitation, he gathers wealth, but what use will it be in the
        end? As one plants, so does he harvest; the body is the field
        of actions. The ungrateful wretches forget the Lord, and wander
        in reincarnation.  || 4 ||   SHALOK:  The benefits of millions
        of charitable donations and cleansing baths, and countless ceremonies
        of purification and piety, O Nanak, are obtained by chanting the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har with one's tongue; all sins
        are washed away.  || 1 ||   I gathered together a great stack
        of firewood, and applied a tiny flame to light it. <br>
