      <p> <font color="#000000">Some read the Sanskrit scriptures, and some
        read the Puraanas. Some meditate on the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, and chant it on their malas, focusing on it in meditation.
        I know nothing, now or ever; I recognize only Your One Name, Lord.
        || 1 ||   I do not know, Lord, what my condition shall be. I am
        foolish and ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary, God. Please, save
        my honor and my self-respect. || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sometimes,
        the soul soars high in the heavens, and sometimes it falls to
        the depths of the nether regions. The greedy soul does not remain
        stable; it searches in the four directions.  || 2 ||   With death
        pre-ordained, the soul comes into the world, gathering the riches
        of life. I see that some have already gone, O my Lord and Master;
        the burning fire is coming closer!  || 3 ||   No one has any friend,
        and no one has any brother; no one has any father or mother. Prays
        Nanak, if You bless me with Your Name, it shall be my help and
        support in the end.  || 4 || 1 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Your
        Light is prevailing everywhere. Wherever I look, there I see the
        Lord.  || 1 ||   Please rid me of the desire to live, O my Lord
        and Master. My mind is entangled in the deep dark pit of Maya.
        How can I cross over, O Lord and Master?  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        He dwells deep within, inside the heart; how can He not be outside
        as well? Our Lord and Master always takes care of us, and keeps
        us in His thoughts.  || 2 ||   He Himself is near at hand, and
        He is far away. He Himself is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.
        Meeting the True Guru, the darkness is dispelled. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Wherever I look, there I see Him pervading.  || 3 ||   There is
        doubt within me, and Maya is outside; it hits me in the eyes like
        an arrow. Prays Nanak, the slave of the Lord's slaves:
        such a mortal suffers terribly.  || 4 || 2 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  Where is that door, where You live, O Lord? What is that
        door called? Among all doors, who can find that door? For the
        sake of that door, I wander around sadly, detached from the world;
        if only someone would come and tell me about that door.  || 1
        ||   How can I cross over the world-ocean? While I am living,
        I cannot be dead.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Pain is the door, and
        anger is the guard; hope and anxiety are the two shutters. Maya
        is the water in the moat; in the middle of this moat, he has built
        his home. The Primal Lord sits in the Seat of Truth.  || 2 ||
        You have so many Names, Lord, I do not know their limit. There
        is no other equal to You. Do not speak out loud - remain
        in your mind. The Lord Himself knows, and He Himself acts.  ||
        3 ||   As long as there is hope, there is anxiety; so how can
        anyone speak of the One Lord? In the midst of hope, remain untouched
        by hope; then, O Nanak, you shall meet the One Lord.  || 4 ||
        In this way, you shall cross over the world-ocean. This is the
        way to remain dead while yet alive.  || 1 ||  Second Pause  ||
        3 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Awareness of the Shabad and the
        Teachings is my horn; the people hear the sound of its vibrations.
        Honor is my begging-bowl, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is the charity I receive.  || 1 ||   O Baba, Gorakh is the Lord
        of the Universe; He is always awake and aware. He alone is Gorakh,
        who sustains the earth; He created it in an instant.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Binding together water and air, He infused the breath
        of life into the body, and made the lamps of the sun and the moon.
        To die and to live, He gave us the earth, but we have forgotten
        these blessings.  || 2 ||   There are so many Siddhas, seekers,
        Yogis, wandering pilgrims, spiritual teachers and good people.
        If I meet them, I chant the Lord's Praises, and then, my
        mind serves Him.  || 3 ||   Paper and salt, protected by ghee,
        remain untouched by water, as the lotus remains unaffected in
        water. Those who meet with such devotees, O servant Nanak -
        what can death do to them?  || 4 || 4 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:
        Listen, Machhindra, to what Nanak says. One who subdues the five
        passions does not waver. One who practices Yoga in such a way,
        saves himself, and saves all his generations.  || 1 ||   He alone
        is a hermit, who attains such understanding. Day and night, he
        remains absorbed in deepest Samaadhi.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He
        begs for loving devotion to the Lord, and lives in the Fear of
        God. He is satisfied, with the priceless gift of contentment.
        Becoming the embodiment of meditation, he attains the true Yogic
        posture. He focuses his consciousness in the deep trance of the
        True Name. || 2 ||   Nanak chants the Ambrosial Bani. Listen,
        O Machhindra: this is the insignia of the true hermit. One who,
        in the midst of hope, remains untouched by hope, shall truly find
        the Creator Lord.  || 3 ||   Prays Nanak, I share the mysterious
        secrets of God. The Guru and His disciple are joined together! <br>

      <p> One who eats this food, this medicine of the Teachings, has the
        wisdom of the six Shaastras.  || 4 || 5 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  My boat is wobbly and unsteady; it is filled with sins.
        The wind is rising - what if it tips over? As sunmukh,
        I have turned to the Guru; O my Perfect Master; please be sure
        to bless me with Your glorious greatness.  || 1 ||   O Guru, my
        Saving Grace, please carry me across the world-ocean. Bless me
        with devotion to the perfect, imperishable Lord God; I am a sacrifice
        to You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He alone is a Siddha, a seeker,
        a Yogi, a wandering pilgrim, who meditates on the One Perfect
        Lord. Touching the feet of the Lord Master, they are emancipated;
        they come to receive the Word of the Teachings.  || 2 ||   I know
        nothing of charity, meditation, self-discipline or religious rituals;
        I only chant Your Name, God. Nanak has met the Guru, the Transcendent
        Lord God; through the True Word of His Shabad, he is set free.
        || 3 || 6 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Focus your consciousness
        in deep absorption on the Lord. Make your body a raft, to cross
        over. Deep within is the fire of desire; keep it in check. Day
        and night, that lamp shall burn unceasingly.  || 1 ||   Float
        such a lamp upon the water; this lamp will bring total understanding.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This understanding is good clay; a lamp
        made of such clay is acceptable to the Lord. So shape this lamp
        on the wheel of good actions. In this world and in the next, this
        lamp shall be with you.  || 2 ||   When He Himself grants His
        Grace, then, as Gurmukh, one may understand Him. Within the heart,
        this lamp is permanently lit. It is not extinguished by water
        or wind. Such a lamp will carry you across the water.  || 3 ||
        Wind does not shake it, or put it out. Its light reveals the
        Divine Throne. The Kh'shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and
        Vaishyas cannot find its value, even by thousands of calculations.
        If any of them lights such a lamp, O Nanak, he is emancipated.
        || 4 || 7 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:  To place one's
        faith in Your Name, Lord, is true worship. With an offering of
        Truth, one obtains a place to sit. If a prayer is offered with
        truth and contentment, the Lord will hear it, and call him in
        to sit by Him.  || 1 ||   O Nanak, no one returns empty-handed;
        such is the Court of the True Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        treasure I seek is the gift of Your Grace. Please bless this humble
        beggar - this is what I seek. Please, pour Your Love into
        the cup of my heart. This is Your pre-determined value.  || 2
        ||   The One who created everything, does everything. He Himself
        appraises His own value. The Sovereign Lord King becomes manifest
        to the Gurmukh. He does not come, and He does not go.  || 3 ||
        People curse at the beggar; by begging, he does not receive
        honor. O Lord, You inspire me to speak Your Words, and tell the
        Story of Your Court.  || 4 || 8 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL: 
        The drop is in the ocean, and the ocean is in the drop. Who understands,
        and knows this? He Himself creates the wondrous play of the world.
        He Himself contemplates it, and understands its true essence. <br>

      <p> || 1 ||   How rare are those who contemplate this spiritual wisdom.
        Through this, the supreme state of liberation is attained.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The night is in the day, and the day is in the
        night. The same is true of hot and cold. No one else knows His
        state and extent; without the Guru, this is not understood.  ||
        2 ||   The female is in the male, and the male is in the female.
        Understand this, O God-realized being! The meditation is in the
        music, and knowledge is in meditation. Become Gurmukh, and speak
        the Unspoken Speech.  || 3 ||   The Light is in the mind, and
        the mind is in the Light. The Guru brings the five senses together,
        like brothers. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those who enshrine
        love for the One Word of the Shabad.  || 4 || 9 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIRST MEHL:  When the Lord God showered His Mercy, egotism was
        eradicated from within me. That humble servant who contemplates
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, is very dear to the Lord.
        || 1 ||   That humble servant of the Lord is pleasing to his
        Lord God; day and night, he performs devotional worship, day and
        night. Disregarding his own honor, he sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The unstruck melody of the
        sound current resonates and resounds; my mind is appeased by the
        subtle essence of the Lord. Through the Perfect Guru, I am absorbed
        in Truth. Through the Guru, I have found the Lord, the Primal
        Being.  || 2 ||   Gurbani is the sound current of the Naad, the
        Vedas, everything. My mind is attuned to the Lord of the Universe.
        He is my sacred shrine of pilgrimage, fasting and austere self-discipline.
        The Lord saves, and carries across, those who meet with the Guru.
        || 3 ||   One whose self-conceit is gone, sees his fears run
        away. That servant grasps the Guru's feet. The Guru, the
        True Guru, has expelled my doubts. Says Nanak, I have merged into
        the Word of the Shabad.  || 4 || 10 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:
        He runs around, begging for clothes and food. He burns with hunger
        and corruption, and will suffer in the world hereafter. He does
        not follow the Guru's Teachings; through his evil-mindedness,
        he loses his honor. Only through the Guru's Teachings will
        such a person become devoted.  || 1 ||   The way of the Yogi is
        to dwell in the celestial home of bliss. He looks impartially,
        equally upon all. He receives the charity of the Lord's
        Love, and the Word of the Shabad, and so he is satisfied.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The five bulls, the senses, pull the wagon of
        the body around. By the Lord's power, one's honor
        is preserved. But when the axle breaks, the wagon falls and crashes.
        It falls apart, like a pile of logs.  || 2 ||   Contemplate the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, Yogi. Look upon pain and pleasure
        as one and the same, sorrow and separation. Let your food be contemplative
        meditation upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad. Your wall shall be permanent, by meditating
        on the Formless Lord.  || 3 ||   Wear the loin-cloth of poise,
        and be free of entanglements. The Guru's Word shall release
        you from sexual desire and anger. In your mind, let your ear-rings
        be the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord. O Nanak, worshipping the
        Lord in deep devotion, the humble are carried across. || 4 ||

      </p>
      <p> <font color="#000000">In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, everyone spoke
        the Truth. In each and every home, devotional worship was performed
        by the people, according to the Guru's Teachings. In that
        Golden Age, Dharma had four feet. How rare are those people who,
        as Gurmukh, contemplate this and understand.  || 1 ||   In all
        four ages, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glory and greatness.
        One who holds tight to the Naam is liberated; without the Guru,
        no one obtains the Naam.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Silver Age
        of Traytaa Yuga, one leg was removed. Hypocrisy became prevalent,
        and people thought that the Lord was far away. The Gurmukhs still
        understood and realized; the Naam abided deep within them, and
        they were at peace.  || 2 ||   In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga,
        duality and double-mindedness arose. Deluded by doubt, they knew
        duality. In this Brass Age, Dharma was left with only two feet.
        Those who became Gurmukh implanted the Naam deep within.  || 3
        ||   In the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, Dharma was left with only one
        power. It walks on just one foot; love and emotional attachment
        to Maya have increased. Love and emotional attachment to Maya
        bring total darkness. If someone meets the True Guru, he is saved,
        through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 ||   Throughout
        the ages, there is only the One True Lord. Among all, is the True
        Lord; there is no other at all. Praising the True Lord, true peace
        is attained. How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, chant the Naam.
        || 5 ||   Throughout all the ages, the Naam is the ultimate,
        the most sublime. How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, understand
        this. One who meditates on the Lord's Name is a humble
        devotee. O Nanak, in each and every age, the Naam is glory and
        greatness.  || 6 || 1 || </font> </p>

        Lord, Har, Har. Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds
        peace, and merges in the Naam.  || 1 ||   O mortal, as Gurmukh,
        worship the Lord in devotion forever. Your heart shall be illumined;
        through the Guru's Teachings, lovingly attune yourself
        to the Lord. You shall merge in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Great Giver is filled with diamonds,
        emeralds, rubies and pearls; one who has good fortune and great
        destiny inscribed upon his forehead, digs them out, by following
        the Guru's Teachings.  || 2 ||   The Lord's Name
        is the jewel, the emerald, the ruby; digging it out, the Guru
        has placed it in your palm. The unfortunate, self-willed manmukh
        does not obtain it; this priceless jewel remains hidden behind
        a curtain of straw.  || 3 ||   If such pre-ordained destiny is
        written upon one's forehead, then the True Guru enjoins
        him to serve Him. O Nanak, then he obtains the jewel, the gem;
        blessed, blessed is that one who follows the Guru's Teachings,
        and finds the Lord.  || 4 || 1 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FOURTH MEHL: 
        Meeting with the humble servants of the Lord, I am in ecstasy;
        they preach the sublime sermon of the Lord. <br>

      <p> The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away; joining the
        Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, one is blessed with understanding.
        || 1 ||   O humble servant of the Lord, follow the Guru's
        Teachings, and chant the Name of the Lord. Whoever hears and speaks
        it is liberated; chanting the Lord's Name, one is embellished
        with beauty.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If someone has supremely high
        destiny written on his forehead, the Lord leads him to meet the
        humble servants of the Lord. Be merciful, and grant me the Blessed
        Vision of the Saints' Darshan, which shall rid me of all
        poverty and pain.  || 2 ||   The Lord's people are good
        and sublime; the unfortunate ones do not like them at all. The
        more the Lord's exalted servants speak of Him, the more
        the slanderers attack and sting them.  || 3 ||   Cursed, cursed
        are the slanderers who do not like the humble, the friends and
        companions of the Lord. Those who do not like the honor and glory
        of the Guru are faithless, black-faced thieves, who have turned
        their backs on the Lord.  || 4 ||   Have mercy, have mercy, please
        save me, Dear Lord. I am meek and humble - I seek Your
        protection. I am Your child, and You are my father, God. Please
        forgive servant Nanak and merge him with Yourself.  || 5 || 2
        ||   RAAMKALEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The friends of the Lord, the humble,
        Holy Saints are sublime; the Lord spreads out His protecting hands
        above them. The Gurmukhs are the Holy Saints, pleasing to God;
        in His mercy, He blends them with Himself.  || 1 ||   O Lord,
        my mind longs to meet with the humble servants of the Lord. The
        sweet, subtle essence of the Lord is immortalizing ambrosia. Meeting
        the Saints, I drink it in.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord's
        people are the most lofty and exalted. Meeting with them, the
        most exalted status is obtained. I am the slave of the slave of
        the Lord's slaves; my Lord and Master is pleased with me.
        || 2 ||   The humble servant serves; one who enshrines love for
        the Lord in his heart, mind and body is very fortunate. One who
        talks too much without love, speaks falsely, and obtains only
        false rewards.  || 3 ||   Take pity on me, O Lord of the World,
        O Great Giver; let me fall at the feet of the Saints. I would
        cut off my head, and cut it into pieces, O Nanak, and set it down
        for the Saints to walk upon.  || 4 || 3 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  If I am blessed with supreme high destiny, I will meet
        the humble servants of the Lord, without delay. The Lord's
        humble servants are pools of ambrosial nectar; by great good fortune,
        one bathes in them.  || 1 ||   O Lord, let me work for the humble
        servants of the Lord. I carry water, wave the fan and grind the
        corn for them; I massage and wash their feet. I apply the dust
        of their feet to my forehead.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord's
        humble servants are great, very great, the greatest and most exalted;
        they lead us to meet the True Guru. No one else is as great as
        the True Guru; meeting the True Guru, I meditate on the Lord,
        the Primal Being.  || 2 ||   Those who seek the Sanctuary of the
        True Guru find the Lord. My Lord and Master saves their honor.
        Some come for their own purposes, and sit before the Guru; they
        pretend to be in Samaadhi, like storks with their eyes closed.
        || 3 ||   Associating with the wretched and the lowly, like the
        stork and the crow, is like feeding on a carcass of poison. Nanak:
        O God, unite me with the Sangat, the Congregation. United with
        the Sangat, I will become a swan. <br>

      <p> || 4 || 4 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  O True Guru, please be
        kind, and unite me with the Lord. My Sovereign Lord is the Beloved
        of my breath of life. I am a slave; I fall at the Guru's
        feet. He has shown me the Path, the Way to my Lord God.  || 1
        ||   The Name of my Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind. I
        have no friend except the Lord; the Lord is my father, my mother,
        my companion.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My breath of life will not
        survive for an instant, without my Beloved; unless I see Him,
        I will die, O my mother! Blessed, blessed is my great, high destiny,
        that I have come to the Guru's Sanctuary. Meeting with
        the Guru, I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan.  || 2 ||   I do not know or understand any other within
        my mind; I meditate and chant the Lord's Chant. Those who
        lack the Naam, wander in shame; their noses are chopped off, bit
        by bit.  || 3 ||   O Life of the World, rejuvenate me! O my Lord
        and Master, enshrine Your Name deep within my heart. O Nanak,
        perfect is the Guru, the Guru. Meeting the True Guru, I meditate
        on the Naam.  || 4 || 5 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The True
        Guru, the Great Giver, is the Great, Primal Being; meeting Him,
        the Lord is enshrined within the heart. The Perfect Guru has granted
        me the life of the soul; I meditate in remembrance on the Ambrosial
        Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Lord, the Guru has implanted the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within my heart. As Gurmukh, I have
        heard His sermon, which pleases my mind; blessed, blessed is my
        great destiny.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Millions, thirty-three millions
        of gods meditate on Him, but they cannot find His end or limitation.
        With sexual urges in their hearts, they beg for beautiful women;
        stretching out their hands, they beg for riches.  || 2 ||   One
        who chants the Praises of the Lord is the greatest of the great;
        the Gurmukh keeps the Lord clasped to his heart. If one is blessed
        with high destiny, he meditates on the Lord, who carries him across
        the terrifying world-ocean.  || 3 ||   The Lord is close to His
        humble servant, and His humble servant is close to the Lord; He
        keeps His humble servant clasped to His Heart. O Nanak, the Lord
        God is our father and mother. I am His child; the Lord cherishes
        me.  || 4 || 6 || 18 || </p>

      <p> He does not think of the One who gave him these; he is blind,
        entangled in emotional attachment.  || 3 ||   One who knows that
        God created him, reaches the Incomparable Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence. Worshipping the Lord, I sing His Glorious Praises. Nanak
        is Your slave.  || 4 || 1 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Place
        yourself beneath all men's feet, and you will be uplifted;
        serve Him in this way. Know that all are above you, and you shall
        find peace in the Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Saints, speak
        that speech which purifies the gods and sanctifies the divine
        beings. As Gurmukh, chant the Word of His Bani, even for an instant.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Renounce your fraudulent plans, and dwell
        in the celestial palace; do not call anyone else false. Meeting
        with the True Guru, you shall receive the nine treasures; in this
        way, you shall find the essence of reality.  || 2 ||   Eradicate
        doubt, and as Gurmukh, enshrine love for the Lord; understand
        your own soul, O Siblings of Destiny. Know that God is near at
        hand, and ever-present. How could you try to hurt anyone else?
        || 3 ||   Meeting with the True Guru, your path shall be clear,
        and you shall easily meet your Lord and Master. Blessed, blessed
        are those humble beings, who, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, find
        the Lord. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to them.  || 4 || 2 ||
        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Coming does not please me, and going
        does not bring me pain, and so my mind is not afflicted by disease.
        I am in bliss forever, for I have found the Perfect Guru; my separation
        from the Lord is totally ended.  || 1 ||   This is how I have
        joined my mind to the Lord. Attachment, sorrow, disease and public
        opinion do not affect me, and so, I enjoy the subtle essence of
        the Lord, Har, Har, Har.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am pure in the
        heavenly realm, pure on this earth, and pure in the nether regions
        of the underworld. I remain apart from the people of the world.
        Obedient to the Lord, I enjoy peace forever; wherever I look,
        I see the Lord of glorious virtues.  || 2 ||   There is no Shiva
        or Shakti, no energy or matter, no water or wind, no world of
        form there, where the True Guru, the Yogi, dwells, where the Imperishable
        Lord God, the Unapproachable Master abides.  || 3 ||   Body and
        mind belong to the Lord; all wealth belongs to the Lord; what
        glorious virtues of the Lord can I describe? Says Nanak, the Guru
        has destroyed my sense of 'mine and yours'. Like water
        with water, I am blended with God.  || 4 || 3 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  It is beyond the three qualities; it remains untouched.
        The seekers and Siddhas do not know it. There is a chamber filled
        with jewels, overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar, in the Guru's
        Treasury.  || 1 ||   This thing is wonderful and amazing! It cannot
        be described. It is an unfathomable object, O Siblings of Destiny!
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Its value cannot be estimated at all; what
        can anyone say about it? By speaking and describing it, it cannot
        be understood; only one who sees it realizes it.  || 2 ||   Only
        the Creator Lord knows it; what can any poor creature do? Only
        He Himself knows His own state and extent. The Lord Himself is
        the treasure overflowing.  || 3 ||   Tasting such Ambrosial Nectar,
        the mind remains satisfied and satiated. <br>

      <p> Says Nanak, my hopes are fulfilled; I have found the Guru's
        Sanctuary.  || 4 || 4 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  God has made
        me His own, and vanquished all my enemies. Those enemies who have
        plundered this world, have all been placed in bondage.  || 1 ||
        The True Guru is my Transcendent Lord. I enjoy countless pleasures
        of power and tasty delights, chanting Your Name, and placing my
        faith in You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I do not think of any other
        at all. The Lord is my protector, above my head. I am carefree
        and independent, when I have the Support of Your Name, O my Lord
        and Master.  || 2 ||   I have become perfect, meeting with the
        Giver of peace, and now, I lack nothing at all. I have obtained
        the essence of excellence, the supreme status; I shall not forsake
        it to go anywhere else.  || 3 ||   I cannot describe how You are,
        O True Lord, unseen, infinite, immeasurable, unfathomable and
        unmoving Lord. O Nanak, He is my Lord and Master.  || 4 || 5 ||
        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are wise; You are eternal and unchanging.
        You are my social class and honor. You are unmoving - You
        never move at all. How can I be worried?  || 1 ||   You alone
        are the One and only Lord; You alone are the king. By Your Grace,
        I have found peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are the ocean, and
        I am Your swan; the pearls and rubies are in You. You give, and
        You do not hesitate for an instant; I receive, forever enraptured.
        || 2 ||   I am Your child, and You are my father; You place the
        milk in my mouth. I play with You, and You caress me in every
        way. You are forever the ocean of excellence.  || 3 ||   You are
        perfect, perfectly all-pervading; I am fulfilled with You as well.
        I am merged, merged, merged and remain merged; O Nanak, I cannot
        describe it!  || 4 || 6 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Make your
        hands the cymbals, your eyes the tambourines, and your forehead
        the guitar you play. Let the sweet flute music resound in your
        ears, and with your tongue, vibrate this song. Move your mind
        like the rhythmic hand-motions; do the dance, and shake your ankle
        bracelets.  || 1 ||   This is the rhythmic dance of the Lord.
        The Merciful Audience, the Lord, sees all your make-up and decorations.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The whole earth is the stage, with the canopy
        of the sky overhead. The wind is the director; people are born
        of water. From the five elements, the puppet was created with
        its actions.  || 2 ||   The sun and the moon are the two lamps
        which shine, with the four corners of the world placed between
        them. The ten senses are the dancing girls, and the five passions
        are the chorus; they sit together within the one body. They all
        put on their own shows, and speak in different languages.  ||
        3 ||   In each and every home there is dancing, day and night;
        in each and every home, the bugles blow. Some are made to dance,
        and some are whirled around; some come and some go, and some are
        reduced to dust. Says Nanak, one who meets with the True Guru,
        does not have to dance the dance of reincarnation again. <br>

        One Universal Creator; he sings the tune of the One Lord. He lives
        in the land of the One Lord, shows the way to the One Lord, and
        remains attuned to the One Lord. He centers his consciousness
        on the One Lord, and serves only the One Lord, who is known through
        the Guru.  || 1 ||   Blessed and good is such a kirtanee, who
        sings such Praises. He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        and renounces the entanglements and pursuits of Maya.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   He makes the five virtues, like contentment, his
        musical instruments, and plays the seven notes of the love of
        the Lord. The notes he plays are the renunciation of pride and
        power; his feet keep the beat on the straight path. He does not
        enter the cycle of reincarnation ever again; he keeps the One
        Word of the Shabad tied to the hem of his robe.  || 2 ||   To
        play like Naarad, is to know that the Lord is ever-present. The
        tinkling of the ankle bells is the shedding of sorrows and worries.
        The dramatic gestures of acting are celestial bliss. Such a dancer
        is not reincarnated again.  || 3 ||   If anyone, out of millions
        of people, becomes pleasing to his Lord and Master, he sings the
        Lord's Praises in this way. I have taken the Support of
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Says Nanak, the Kirtan
        of the One Lord's Praises are sung there.  || 4 || 8 ||
        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Some call Him, 'Raam, Raam',
        and some call Him, 'Khudaa-i'. Some serve Him as 'Gusain',
        others as 'Allaah'.  || 1 ||   He is the Cause of
        causes, the Generous Lord. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon
        us.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Some bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage,
        and some make the pilgrimage to Mecca.  || 2 ||   Some perform
        devotional worship services, and some bow their heads in prayer.
        || 2 ||   Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran. Some wear
        blue robes, and some wear white.  || 3 ||   Some call themselves
        Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise,
        and others long for heaven.  || 4 ||   Says Nanak, one who realizes
        the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord
        and Master.  || 5 || 9 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The wind
        merges into the wind. The light blends into the light. The dust
        becomes one with the dust. What support is there for the one who
        is lamenting?  || 1 ||   Who has died? O, who has died? O God-realized
        beings, meet together and consider this. What a wondrous thing
        has happened!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   No one knows what happens
        after death. The one who is lamenting will also arise and depart.
        Mortal beings are bound by the bonds of doubt and attachment.
        When life becomes a dream, the blind man babbles and grieves in
        vain.  || 2 ||   The Creator Lord created this creation. It comes
        and goes, subject to the Will of the Infinite Lord. No one dies;
        no one is capable of dying. The soul does not perish; it is imperishable.
        || 3 ||   That which is known, does not exist. I am a sacrifice
        to the one who knows this. Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled
        my doubt. No one dies; no one comes or goes.  || 4 || 10 ||  
        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate on the Lord of the Universe,
        the Beloved Lord of the World. Meditating in remembrance on the
        Lord's Name, you shall live, and the Great Death shall
        not consume you ever again.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Through millions
        of incarnations, you have come, wandering, wandering, wandering. <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The four Vedas proclaim it, but you don't
        believe them. The six Shaastras also say one thing. The eighteen
        Puraanas all speak of the One God. Even so, Yogi, you do not understand
        this mystery.  || 1 ||   The celestial harp plays the incomparable
        melody, but in your intoxication, you do not hear it, O Yogi.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the first age, the Golden Age, the village
        of truth was inhabited. In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, things
        began to decline. In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, half of it
        was gone. Now, only one leg of Truth remains, and the One Lord
        is revealed.  || 2 ||   The beads are strung upon the one thread.
        By means of many, various, diverse knots, they are tied, and kept
        separate on the string. The beads of the mala are lovingly chanted
        upon in many ways. When the thread is pulled out, the beads come
        together in one place.  || 3 ||   Throughout the four ages, the
        One Lord made the body His temple. It is a treacherous place,
        with several windows. Searching and searching, one comes to the
        Lord's door. Then, O Nanak, the Yogi attains a home in
        the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.  || 4 ||   Thus, the
        celestial harp plays the incomparable melody; hearing it, the
        Yogi's mind finds it sweet. || 1 ||  Second Pause  || 1
        || 12 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The body is a patch-work of
        threads. The muscles are stitched together with the needles of
        the bones. The Lord has erected a pillar of water. O Yogi, why
        are you so proud?  || 1 ||   Meditate on your Lord Master, day
        and night. The patched coat of the body shall last for only a
        few days.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Smearing ashes on your body, you
        sit in a deep meditative trance. You wear the ear-rings of 'mine
        and yours'. You beg for bread, but you are not satisfied.
        Abandoning your Lord Master, you beg from others; you should feel
        ashamed.  || 2 ||   Your consciousness is restless, Yogi, as you
        sit in your Yogic postures. You blow your horn, but still feel
        sad. You do not understand Gorakh, your guru. Again and again,
        Yogi, you come and go.  || 3 ||   He, unto whom the Master shows
        Mercy - unto Him, the Guru, the Lord of the World, I offer
        my prayer. One who has the Name as his patched coat, and the Name
        as his robe, O servant Nanak, such a Yogi is steady and stable.
        || 4 ||   One who meditates on the Master in this way, night
        and day, finds the Guru, the Lord of the World, in this life.
        || 1 ||  Second Pause  || 2 || 13 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        He is the Creator, the Cause of causes; I do not see any other
        at all. My Lord and Master is wise and all-knowing. Meeting with
        the Gurmukh, I enjoy His Love.  || 1 ||   Such is the sweet, subtle
        essence of the Lord. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, taste
        it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Light of the Ambrosial Name of the
        Lord is immaculate and pure. </font><br>
