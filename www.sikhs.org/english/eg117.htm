      <p> All wealth and treasures are obtained by remembering Him in meditation;
        twenty-four hours a day, O my mind, meditate on Him.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Your Name is Ambrosial Nectar, O my Lord and Master.
        Whoever drinks it in is satisfied. The sinful residues of countless
        incarnations are erased, and hereafter, he shall be saved and
        redeemed in the Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||   I have come to Your
        Sanctuary, O Creator, O Perfect Supreme Eternal Lord God. Please
        be kind to me, that I may meditate on Your Lotus Feet. O Nanak,
        my mind and body thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.

      <p> <font color="#000000">O my mind, why are you lured away by otherness?
        Here and hereafter, God is forever your Help and Support. He is
        your soul-mate; He will help you succeed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The Name of your Beloved Lover, the Fascinating Lord, is Ambrosial
        Nectar. Drinking it in, you shall find satisfaction. The Being
        of Immortal Manifestation is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy. Meditate on Him in that most sublime place.  || 1
        ||   The Bani, the Word of the Supreme Lord God, is the greatest
        Mantra of all. It eradicates pride from the mind. Searching, Nanak
        found the home of peace and bliss in the Name of the Lord.  ||
        2 || 1 || 20 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my mind, sing forever
        the Songs of Joy of the Lord of the Universe. All your disease,
        sorrow and sin will be erased, if you meditate on the Lord's
        Name, even for an instant.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Abandon all your
        clever tricks; go and enter the Sanctuary of the Holy. When the
        Lord, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor becomes merciful,
        the Messenger of Death is changed into the Righteous Judge of
        Dharma.  || 1 ||   Without the One Lord, there is no other at
        all. No one else can equal Him. The Lord is Nanak's Mother,
        Father and Sibling, the Giver of Peace, his Breath of Life.  ||
        2 || 2 || 21 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord's humble
        servant saves those who accompany him. Their minds are sanctified
        and rendered pure, and they are rid of the pains of countless
        incarnations.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who walk on the path
        find peace; they are saved, along with those who speak with them.
        Even those who are drowning in the horrible, deep dark pit are
        carried across in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. 
        || 1 ||   Those who have such high destiny turn their faces toward
        the Saadh Sangat. Nanak longs for the dust of their feet; O God,
        please shower Your Mercy on me!  || 2 || 3 || 22 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The humble servant of the Lord meditates on the
        Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. One who enjoys peace in the Company of
        the Holy, even for an instant, obtains millions of heavenly paradises.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This human body, so difficult to obtain,
        is sanctified by meditating on the Lord. It takes away the fear
        of death. Even the sins of terrible sinners are washed away, by
        cherishing the Lord's Name within the heart.  || 1 || 
        Whoever listens to the Immaculate Praises of the Lord -
        his pains of birth and death are dispelled. <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">O my Fascinating Lord, I pray to You: come
        into my house. I act in pride, and speak in pride. I am mistaken
        and wrong, but I am still Your hand-maiden, O my Beloved.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   I hear that You are near, but I cannot see You.
        I wander in suffering, deluded by doubt. The Guru has become merciful
        to me; He has removed the veils. Meeting with my Beloved, my mind
        blossoms forth in abundance.  || 1 ||   If I were to forget my
        Lord and Master, even for an instant, it would be like millions
        of days, tens of thousands of years. When I joined the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, I met my Lord.  || 2 || 1 ||
        24 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Now what should I think? I have
        given up thinking. You do whatever You wish to do. Please bless
        me with Your Name - I am a sacrifice to You.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   The poison of corruption is flowering forth in the
        four directions; I have taken the GurMantra as my antidote. Giving
        me His Hand, He has saved me as His Own; like the lotus in the
        water, I remain unattached.  || 1 ||   I am nothing. What am I?
        You hold all in Your Power. Nanak has run to Your Sanctuary, Lord;
        please save him, for the sake of Your Saints.  || 2 || 2 || 25
        ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Now I have abandoned all efforts and
        devices. My Lord and Master is the All-powerful Creator, the Cause
        of causes, my only Saving Grace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have
        seen numerous forms of incomparable beauty, but nothing is like
        You. You give Your Support to all, O my Lord and Master; You are
        the Giver of peace, of the soul and the breath of life.  || 1
        ||   Wandering, wandering, I grew so tired; meeting the Guru,
        I fell at His Feet. Says Nanak, I have found total peace; this
        life-night of mine passes in peace.  || 2 || 3 || 26 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Now I have found the Support of my Lord. The Guru,
        the Giver of peace, has become merciful to me. I was blind -
        I see the jewel of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have cut
        away the darkness of ignorance and become immaculate; my discriminationg
        intellect has blossomed forth. As the waves of water and the foam
        become water again, the Lord and His servant become One.  || 1
        ||   He is taken in again, into what from which he came; all is
        one in the One Lord. O Nanak, I have come to see the Master of
        the breath of life, all-pervading everywhere.  || 2 || 4 || 27
        ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  My mind longs for the One Beloved
        Lord. I have looked everywhere in every country, but nothing equals
        even a hair of my Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All sorts of
        delicacies and dainties are placed before me, but I do not even
        want to look at them. I long for the sublime essence of the Lord,
        calling, &quot;Pri-o! Pri-o! - Beloved! Beloved!&quot;,
        like the Bumble bee longing for the lotus flower. <br>

      <p> || 1 ||   The Treasure of Virtue, the Enticer of the mind, my
        Beloved is the Giver of peace to all. Guru Nanak has led me to
        You, O God. Join with me, O my Best Friend, and hold me close
        in Your Embrace.  || 2 || 5 || 28 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        Now my mind is pleased and appeased by my Lord and Master. The
        Holy Saint has become kind and compassionate to me, and has destroyed
        this demon of duality.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are so beautiful,
        and You are so wise; You are elegant and all-knowing. All the
        Yogis, spiritual teachers and meditators do not know even a bit
        of Your value.  || 1 ||   You are the Master, You are the Lord
        under the royal canopy; You are the perfectly pervading Lord God.
        Please bless me with the gift of service to the Saints; O Nanak,
        I am a sacrifice to the Lord.  || 2 || 6 || 29 ||   SAARANG, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Love of my Beloved comes into my conscious mind.
        I have forgotten the entangling affairs of Maya, and I spend my
        life-night fighting with evil.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I serve the
        Lord; the Lord abides within my heart. I have found my Lord in
        the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. So I have met with my enticingly
        beautiful Beloved; I have obtained the peace which I asked for.
        || 1 ||   The Guru has brought my Beloved under my control, and
        I enjoy Him with unrestrained pleasure. I have become fearless;
        O Nanak, my fears have been eradicated. Chanting the Word, I have
        found the Lord.  || 2 || 7 || 30 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  I
        am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of my Dear Lord.
        The Naad, the Sound-current of His Word fills my ears; my body
        has settled gently into the Lap of my Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I was a discarded bride, and the Guru has made me a happy
        soul-bride. I have found the Elegant and All-knowing Lord. That
        home, in which I was not even allowed to sit - I have found
        that place in which I can dwell.  || 1 ||   God, the Love of His
        devotees, has come under the control of those who protect the
        honor of His Saints. Says Nanak, my mid is pleased and appeased
        with the Lord, and my subservience to other people has come to
        an end.  || 2 || 8 || 31 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Now my association
        with the five thieves has come to an end. Gazing upon the Blessed
        Vision of the Lord's Darshan, my mind is in ecstasy; by
        Guru's Grace, I am released.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        impregnable place is guarded by countless ramparts and warriors.
        This impregnable fortress cannot be touched, but with the assistance
        of the Saints, I have entered and robbed it.  || 1 ||   I have
        found such a great treasure, a priceless, inexhaustible supply
        of jewels. O servant Nanak, when God showered His Mercy on me,
        my mind drank in the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 2 || 9 ||
        32 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Now my mind is absorbed in my Lord
        and Master. The Perfect Guru has blessed me with the gift of the
        breath of life. I am involved with the Lord, like the fish with
        the water.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have cast out sexual desire,
        anger, greed, egotism and envy; I have offered all this as a gift.
        The Guru has implanted the medicine of the Lord's Mantra
        within me, and I have met with the All-knowing Lord God.  || 1

      <p> My household belongs to You, O my Lord and Master; the Guru has
        blessed me with God, and rid me of egotism. Says Nanak, I have
        found the Lord with intuitive ease, within the home of my own
        heart. Devotional worship of the Lord is a treasure over-flowing.
        || 2 || 10 || 33 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my Enticing Lord,
        all beings are Yours - You save them. Even a tiny bit of
        Your Mercy ends all cruelty and tyranny. You save and redeem millions
        of universes.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I offer countless prayers;
        I remember You each and every instant. Please be merciful to me,
        O Destroyer of the pains of the poor; please give me Your hand
        and save me.  || 1 ||   And what about these poor kings? Tell
        me, who can they kill? Save me, save me, save me, O Giver of peace;
        O Nanak, all the world is Yours.  || 2 || 11 || 34 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Now I have obtained the wealth of the Lord's
        Name. I have become carefree, and all my thirsty desires are satisfied.
        Such is the destiny written on my forehead.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Searching and searching, I became depressed; I wandered all
        around, and finally came back to my body-village. The Merciful
        Guru made this deal, and I have obtained the priceless jewel.
        || 1 ||   The other deals and trades which I did, brought only
        sorrow and suffering. Fearless are those traders who deal in meditation
        on the Lord of the Universe. O Nanak, the Lord's Name is
        their capital.  || 2 || 12 || 35 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        Speech of my Beloved seems so sweet to my mind. The Guru has taken
        hold of my arm, and linked me to God's service. My Beloved
        Lord is forever merciful to me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O God, You
        are my Lord and Master; You are the Cherisher of all. My wife
        and I are totally Your slaves. You are all my honor and power
        - You are. Your Name is my only Support.  || 1 ||   If
        You seat me on the throne, then I am Your slave. If You make me
        a grass-cutter, then what can I say? Servant Nanak's God
        is the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, Unfathomable and
        Immeasurable.  || 2 || 13 || 36 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        tongue becomes beautiful, uttering the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord. In an instant, He creates and destroys. Gazing upon His
        Wondrous Plays, my mind is fascinated.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Listening
        to His Praises, my mind is in utter ecstasy, and my heart is rid
        of pride and pain. I have found peace, and my pains have been
        taken away, since I became one with God.  || 1 ||   Sinful resides
        have been wiped away, and my mind is immaculate. The Guru has
        lifted me up and pulled me out of the deception of Maya. Says
        Nanak, I have found God, the All-powerful Creator, the Cause of
        causes.  || 2 || 14 || 37 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  With my
        eyes, I have seen the marvellous wonders of the Lord. He is far
        from all, and yet near to all. He is Inaccessible and Unfathomable,
        and yet He dwells in the heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Infallible
        Lord never makes a mistake. He does not have to write His Orders,
        and He does not have to consult with anyone. In an instant, He
        creates, embellishes and destroys. He is the Lover of His devotees,
        the Treasure of Excellence.  || 1 ||   Lighting the lamp in the
        deep dark pit, the Guru illumines and enlightens the heart. <br>

        found peace, and all my hopes have been fulfilled.  || 2 || 15
        || 38 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The most beautiful path for
        the feet is to follow the Lord of the Universe. The more you walk
        on any other path, the more you suffer in pain.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The eyes are sanctified, gazing upon the Blessed Vision
        of the Lord's Darshan. Serving Him, the hands are sanctified.
        The heart is sanctified, when the Lord abides within the heart;
        that forehead which touches the dust of the feet of the Saints
        is sanctified.  || 1 ||   All treasures are in the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har; he alone obtains it, who has it written in his
        karma. Servant Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru; he passes
        his life-night in peace, poise and pleasure.  || 2 || 16 || 39
        ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate on the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord; at the very last instant, it shall be your Help and
        Support. In that place where your mother, father, children and
        siblings shall be of no use to you at all, there, the Name alone
        shall save you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He alone meditates on the
        Lord in the deep dark pit of his own household, upon whose forehead
        such destiny is written. His bonds are loosened, and the Guru
        liberates him. He sees You, O Lord, everywhere.  || 1 ||   Drinking
        in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, his mind is satisfied. Tasting
        it, his tongue is satiated. Says Nanak, I have obtained celestial
        peace and poise; the Guru has quenched all my thirst.  || 2 ||
        17 || 40 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meeting the Guru, I meditate
        on God in such a way, that He has become kind and compassionate
        to me. He is the Destroyer of pain; He does not allow the hot
        wind to even touch me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   With each and every
        breath I take, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. He is
        not separated from me, even for an instant, and I never forget
        Him. He is always with me, wherever I go.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to His Lotus Feet. I am
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Guru's
        Darshan. Says Nanak, I do not care about anything else; I have
        found the Lord, the Ocean of peace.  || 2 || 18 || 41 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Word of the Guru's Shabad seems so sweet
        to my mind. My karma has been activated, and the Divine Radiance
        of the Lord, Har, Har, is manifest in each and every heart.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Supreme Lord God, beyond birth, Self-existent,
        is seated within every heart everywhere. I have come to obtain
        the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I am a
        sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Lotus Feet of God.  || 1 ||   I
        anoint my forehead with the dust of the Society of the Saints;
        it is as if I have bathed at all the sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
        Says Nanak, I am dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love; the
        Love of my Lord shall never fade away.  || 2 || 19 || 42 ||  
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Guru has given me the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, as my Companion. If the Word of God dwells within my
        heart for even an instant, all my hunger is relieved.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   O Treasure of Mercy, Master of Excellence, my Lord
        and Master, Ocean of peace, Lord of all. My hopes rest in You
        alone, O my Lord and Master; hope in anything else is useless.

      <p> My eyes were satisfied and fulfilled, gazing upon the Blessed
        Vision of His Darshan, when the Guru placed His Hand on my forehead.
        Says Nanak, I have found immeasurable peace; my fear of birth
        and death is gone.  || 2 || 20 || 43 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        You fool: why are you going somewhere else? The Enticing Ambrosial
        Amrit is with you, but you are deluded, totally deluded, and you
        eat poison.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God is Beautiful, Wise and Incomparable;
        He is the Creator, the Architect of Destiny, but you have no love
        for Him. The mad-man's mind is enticed by Maya, the enticer;
        he has taken the intoxicating drug of falsehood.  || 1 ||   The
        Destroyer of pain has become kind and compassionate to me, and
        I am in tune with the Saints. I have obtained all treasures within
        the home of my own heart; says Nanak, my light has merged into
        the Light.  || 2 || 21 || 44 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  My consciousness
        has loved my Beloved God, since the very beginning of time. When
        You blessed me with the Teachings, O my True Guru, I was embellished
        with beauty.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am mistaken; You are never
        mistaken. I am a sinner; You are the Saving Grace of sinners.
        I am a lowly thorn-tree, and You are the sandalwood tree. Please
        preserve my honor by staying with me; please stay with me.  ||
        1 ||   You are deep and profound, calm and benevolent. What am
        I? Just a poor helpless being. The Merciful Guru Nanak has united
        me with the Lord. I lay on His Bed of Peace.  || 2 || 22 || 45
        ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my mind, blessed and approved is
        that day, and fruitful is that hour, and lucky is that moment,
        when the True Guru blesses me with spirtual wisdom.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Blessed is my good destiny, and blessed is my Husband
        Lord. Blessed are those upon whom honor is bestowed. This body
        is Yours, all my home and wealth are Yours; I offer my heart as
        a sacrifice to You.  || 1 ||   I obtain tens of thousands and
        millions of regal pleasures, if I gaze upon Your Blessed Vision,
        even for an instant. When You, O God, say, &quot;My servant,
        stay here with me&quot;, Nanak knows unlimited peace.  || 2 ||
        23 || 46 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Now I am rid of my skepticism
        and sorrow. I have abandoned and forsaken all other efforts, and
        come to the Sanctuary of the True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        I have attained total perfection, and all my works are perfectly
        completed; the illness of egotism has been totally eradicated.
        Millions of sins are destroyed in an instant; meeting with the
        Guru, I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   Subduing
        the five thieves, he Guru has made them my slaves; my mind has
        become stable and steady and fearless. It does not come or go
        in reincarnation; it does not waver or wander anywhere. O Nanak,
        my empire is eternal.  || 2 || 24 || 47 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Here and hereafter, God is forever my Help and Support. He is
        the Enticer of my mind, the Beloved of my soul. What Glorious
        Praises of His can I sing and chant?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He
        plays with me, He fondles and caresses me. Forever and ever, He
        blesses me with bliss. He cherishes me, like the father and the
        mother love their child.  || 1 ||   I cannot survive without Him,
        even for an instant; I shall never forget Him. <br>

      <p> Says Nanak, joining the Society of the Saints, I am enraptured,
        lovingly attuned to my Lord.  || 2 || 25 || 48 ||   SAARANG, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  Sing of your Lord and Master, your Best Friend. Do
        not place your hopes in anyone else; meditate on God, the Giver
        of peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Peace, joy and salvation are in
        His Home. Seek the Protection of His Sanctuary. But if you forsake
        Him, and serve mortal beings, your honor will dissolve like salt
        in water.  || 1 ||   I have grasped the Anchor and Support of
        my Lord and Master; meeting with the Guru, I have found wisdom
        and understanding. Nanak has met God, the Treasure of Excellence;
        all dependence on others is gone.  || 2 || 26 || 49 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I have the Almighty Support of my Dear Lord God.
        I do not look up to anyone else. My honor and glory are Yours,
        O God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God has taken my side; He has lifted
        me up and pulled me out of the whirlpool of corruption. He has
        poured the medicine of the Naam, the Ambrosial Name of the Lord,
        into my mouth; I have fallen at the Guru's Feet.  || 1
        ||   How can I praise You with only one mouth? You are generous,
        even to the unworthy. You cut away the noose, and now You own
        me; Nanak is blessed with myriad joys.  || 2 || 27 || 50 ||  
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Remembering God in meditation, pains are
        dispelled. When the Giver of peace to the soul becomes merciful,
        the mortal is totally redeemed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I know of
        none other than God; tell me, who else should I approach? As You
        know me, so do You keep me, O my Lord and Master.I have surrendered
        everything to You.  || 1 ||   God gave me His Hand and saved me;
        He has blessed me with eternal life. Says Nanak, my mind is in
        ecstasy; the noose of death has been cut away from my neck.  ||
        2 || 28 || 51 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  My mind contemplates
        You, O Lord, all the time. I am Your meek and helpless child;
        You are God my Father. As You know me, You save me.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   When I am hungry, I ask for food; when I am full,
        I am totally at peace. When I dwell with You, I am free of disease;
        if I become separated from You, I turn to dust.  || 1 ||   What
        power does the slave of Your slave have, O Establisher and Disestablisher?
        If I do not forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, then I die.
        Nanak offers this prayer.  || 2 || 29 || 52 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  I have shaken off fear and dread from my mind. With intuitive
        ease, peace and poise, I sing the Glorious Praises of my Kind,
        Sweet, Darling Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Practicing the Guru's
        Word, by His Grace, I do not wander anywhere anymore. The illusion
        has been dispelled; I am in Samaadhi, Sukh-aasan, the position
        of peace. I have found the Lord, the Lover of His devotees, within
        the home of my own heart.  || 1 ||   The Sound-current of the
        Naad, playful joys and pleasures - I am intuitively, easily
        absorbed into the Celestial Lord. He Himself is the Creator, the
        Cause of causes. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Says Nanak, He Himself is All-in-all.  || 2 || 30 || 53 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is the Support of the mind. I am a sacrifice to the One
        who gave it to me; I humbly bow to the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   My thirst is quenched, and I have been intuitively
        embellished. The poisons of sexual desire and anger have been
        burnt away. This mind does not come and go; it abides in that
        place, where the Formless Lord sits.  || 1 ||   The One Lord is
        manifest and radiant; the One Lord is hidden and mysterious. The
        One Lord is abysmal darkness. From the beginning, throughout the
        middle and until the end, is God. Says Nanak, reflect on the Truth.
        || 2 || 31 || 54 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Without God, I cannot
        survive, even for an instant. One who finds joy in the Lord finds
        total peace and perfection.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God is the Embodiment
        of bliss, the Breath of Life and Wealth; remembering Him in meditation,
        I am blessed with absolute bliss. He is utterly All-powerful,
        with me forever and ever; what tongue can utter His Glorious Praises?
        || 1 ||   His Place is sacred, and His Glory is sacred; sacred
        are those who listen and speak of Him. Says Nanak, that dwelling
        is sacred, in which Your Saints live.  || 2 || 32 || 55 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  My tongue chants Your Name, Your Name. In the mother's
        womb, You sustained me, and in this mortal world, You alone help
        me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are my Father, and You are my Mother;
        You are my Loving Friend and Sibling. You are my Family, and You
        are my Support. You are the Giver of the Breath of Life.  || 1
        ||   You are my Treasure, and You are my Wealth. You are my Gems
        and Jewels. You are the wish-fulfilling Elysian Tree. Nanak has
        found You through the Guru, and now he is enraptured.  || 2 ||
        33 || 56 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Wherever he goes, his consciousness
        turns to his own. Whoever is a chaylaa (a servant) goes only to
        his Lord and Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He shares his sorrows,
        his joys and his condition only with his own. He obtains honor
        from his own, and strength from his own; he gets an advantage
        from his own.  || 1 ||   Some have regal power, youth, wealth
        and property; some have a father and a mother. I have obtained
        all things, O Nanak, from the Guru. My hopes have been fulfilled.
        || 2 || 34 || 57 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  False is intoxication
        and pride in Maya. Get rid of your fraud and attachment, O wretched
        mortal, and remember that the Lord of the World is with you. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   False are royal powers, youth, nobility,
        kings, rulers and aristocrats. False are the fine clothes, perfumes
        and clever tricks; false are the foods and drinks.  || 1 ||  
        O Patron of the meek and the poor, I am the slave of Your slaves;
        I seek the Sanctuary of Your Saints. I humbly ask, I beg of You,
        please relieve my anxiety; O Lord of Life, please unite Nanak
        with Yourself.  || 2 || 35 || 58 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  By
        himself, the mortal cannot accomplish anything. He runs around
        chasing all sorts of projects, engrossed in other entanglements.

      <p> His companions of these few days will not be there when he is
        in trouble. He is hand and glove with those who are of no use
        to him; the poor wretch is affectionately involved with them.
        || 1 ||   I am nothing; nothing belongs to me. I have no power
        or control. O Creator, Cause of causes, Lord God of Nanak, I am
        saved and redeemed in the Society of the Saints.  || 2 || 36 ||
        59 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Great Enticer Maya keeps enticing,
        and cannot be stopped. She is the Beloved of all the Siddhas and
        seekers; no one can fend her off.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Reciting
        the six Shaastras and visiting sacred shrines of pilgrimage do
        not decrease her power. Devotional worship, ceremonial religious
        marks, fasting, vows and penance - none of these will make
        her release her hold.  || 1 ||   The world has fallen into the
        deep dark pit. O Saints, please bless me with the supreme status
        of salvation. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak
        has been liberated, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of their Darshan,
        even for an instant.  || 2 || 37 || 60 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Why are you working so hard to earn profits? You are puffed up
        like a bag of air, and your skin is very brittle. Your body has
        grown old and dusty.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You move things from
        here to there, like the hawk swooping down on the flesh of its
        prey. You are blind - you have forgotten the Great Giver.
        You fill your belly like a traveller at an inn.  || 1 ||   You
        are entangled in the taste of false pleasures and corrupt sins;
        the path which you have to take is very narrow. Says Nanak: figure
        it out, you ignorant fool! Today or tomorrow, the knot will be
        untied!  || 2 || 38 || 61 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O Dear Guru,
        by associating with You, I have come to know the Lord. There are
        millions of heroes, and no one pays any attention to them, but
        in the Court of the Lord, I am honored and respected.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   What is the origin of the human beings? How beautiful
        they are! When God infuses His Light into clay, the human body
        is judged to be precious.  || 1 ||   From You, I have learned
        to serve; from You, I have learned to chant and meditate; from
        You, I have realized the essence of reality. Placing His Hand
        on my forehead, He has cut away the bonds which held me; O Nanak,
        I am the slave of His slaves.  || 2 || 39 || 62 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord has blessed His servant with His Name.
        What can any poor mortal do to someone who has the Lord as his
        Savior and Protector?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself is the
        Great Being; He Himself is the Leader. He Himself accomplishes
        the tasks of His servant. Our Lord and Master destroys all demons;
        He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.  || 1 ||   He
        Himself saves the honor of His servants; He Himself blesses them
        with stability. From the very beginning of time, and throughout
        the ages, He saves His servants. O Nanak, how rare is the person
        who knows God.  || 2 || 49 || 63 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O
        Lord, You are my Best Friend, my Companion, my Breath of Life.
        My mind, wealth, body and soul are all Yours; this body is sewn
        together by Your Blessing.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You have blessed
        me with all sorts of gifts; you have blessed me with honor and
        respect. Forever and ever, You preserve my honor, O Inner-knower,
        O Searcher of hearts.  || 1 || <br>

      <p> Those Saints who know You, O Lord and Master - blessed
        and approved is their coming into the world. The Congregation
        of those humble beings is obtained by great good fortune; Nanak
        is a sacrifice to the Saints.  || 2 || 41 || 64 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Save me, O Merciful Saint! You are the All-powerful
        Cause of causes. You have ended my separation, and joined me with
        God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You save us from the corruption and
        sins of countless incarnations; associating with You, we obtain
        sublime understanding. Forgetting God, we wandered through countless
        incarnations; with each and every breath, we sing the Lord's
        Praises.  || 1 ||   Whoever meets with the Holy Saints -
        those sinners are sanctified. Says Nanak, those who have such
        high destiny, win this invaluable human life.  || 2 || 42 || 65
        ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my Lord and Master, Your humble
        servant has come to offer this prayer. Hearing Your Name, I am
        blessed with total peace, bliss, poise and pleasure.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The Treasure of Mercy, the Ocean of Peace -
        His Praises are diffused everywhere. O Lord, You celebrate in
        the Society of the Saints; You reveal Yourself to them.  || 1
        ||   With my eyes I see the Saints, and dedicate myself to serving
        them; I wash their feet with my hair. Twenty-four hours a day,
        I gaze upon the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of the Saints; this
        is the peace and comfort which Nanak has received.  || 2 || 43
        || 66 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who is lovingly absorbed
        in the Lord's Name is a good-hearted friend, intuitively
        embellished with happiness. He is said to be blessed and fortunate.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is rid of sin and corruption, and detached
        from Maya; he has renounced the poison of egotistical intellect.
        He thirsts for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan,
        and he places his hopes in the One Lord alone. The Feet of his
        Beloved are the Support of his heart.  || 1 ||   He sleeps, wakes,
        rises up and sits down without anxiety; he laughs and cries without
        anxiety. Says Nanak, she who has cheated the world - that
        Maya is cheated by the humble servant of the Lord.  || 2 || 44
        || 67 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Now, no one complains about
        the Lord's humble servant. Whoever tries to complain is
        destroyed by the Guru, the Transcendent Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Whoever harbors vengeance against the One who is beyond
        all vengenace, shall lose in the Court of the Lord. From the very
        beginning of time, and throughout the ages, it is the glorious
        greatness of God, that He preserves the honor of His humble servants.
        || 1 ||   The mortal becomes fearless, and all his fears are
        taken away, when he leans on the Support of the Lord's
        Lotus Feet. Chanting the Name, through the Guru's Word,
        Nanak has become famous throughout the world.  || 2 || 45 || 68
        ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord's humble servant has
        discarded all self-conceit. As You see fit, You save us, O Lord
        of the World. Beholding Your Glorious Grandeur, I live.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Through the Guru's Instruction, and the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all sorrow and suffering
        is taken away. I look upon friend and enemy alike; all that I
        speak is the Lord's meditation.  || 1 ||   The fire within
        me is quenched; I am cool, calm and tranquil. Hearing the unstruck
        celestial melody, I am wonder-struck and amazed. <br>

        the perfect perfection of the Sound-current of the Naad.  || 2
        || 46 || 69 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  My Guru has rid me of
        my cynicism. I am a sacrifice to that Guru; I am devoted to Him,
        forever and ever.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I chant the Guru's
        Name day and night; I enshrine the Guru's Feet within my
        mind. I bathe continually in the dust of the Guru's Feet,
        washing off the dirty residues of my sinful mistakes.  || 1 ||
        I continually serve the Perfect Guru; I humbly bow to my Guru.
        The Perfect Guru has blessed me with all fruitful rewards; O Nanak,
        the Guru has emancipated me.  || 2 || 47 || 70 ||   SAARANG, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, the mortal attains salvation. His sorrows are dispelled,
        and his fears are all erased; he is in love with the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   His mind worships
        and adores the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har; his tongue sings the
        Praises of the Lord. Abandoning egotistical pride, sexual desire,
        anger and slander, he embraces love for the Lord.  || 1 ||   Worship
        and adore the Merciful Lord God; chanting the Name of the Lord
        of the Universe, you shall be embellished and exalted. Says Nanak,
        whoever becomes the dust of all, merges in the Blesed Vision of
        the Lord, Har, Har.  || 2 || 48 || 71 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        I am a sacrifice to my Perfect Guru. My Savior Lord has saved
        me; He has revealed the Glory of His Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        He makes His servants and slaves fearless, and takes away all
        their pain. So renounce all other efforts, and enshrine the Lord's
        Lotus Feet within your mind.  || 1 ||   God is the Support of
        the breath of life, my Best Friend and Companion, the One and
        Only Creator of the Universe. Nanak's Lord and Master is
        the Highest of all; again and again, I humbly bow to Him.  ||
        2 || 49 || 72 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Tell me: other than
        the Lord, who exists? The Creator, the Embodiment of Mercy, bestows
        all comforts; meditate forever on that God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        All creatures are strung on His Thread; sing the Praises of
        that God. Meditate in remembrance on that Lord and Master who
        gives you everything. Why would you go to anyone else?  || 1 ||
        Service to my Lord and Master is fruitful and rewarding; from
        Him, you shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desires.
        Says Nanak, take your profits and leave; you shall go to your
        true home in peace.  || 2 || 50 || 73 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        O my Lord and Master, I have come to Your Sanctuary. The anxiety
        of my mind departed, when I gazed upon the Blessed Vision of Your
        Darshan.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You know my condition, without
        my speaking. You inspire me to chant Your Name. My pains are gone,
        and I am absorbed in peace, poise and bliss, singing Your Glorious
        Praises.  || 1 ||   Taking me by the arm, You lifted me up, out
        of the deep dark pit of household and Maya. Says Nanak, the Guru
        has broken my bonds, and ended my separaation; He has united me
        with God.  || 2 || 51 || 74 || </p>
