      <p> <font color="#000000">By thinking, He cannot be reduced to thought,
        even by thinking hundreds of thousands of times. By remaining
        silent, inner silence is not obtained, even by remaining lovingly
        absorbed deep within. The hunger of the hungry is not appeased,
        even by piling up loads of worldly goods. Hundreds of thousands
        of clever tricks, but not even one of them will go along with
        you in the end. So how can you become truthful? And how can the
        veil of illusion be torn away? O Nanak, it is written that you
        shall obey the Hukam of His Command, and walk in the Way of His
        Will.  || 1 ||   By His Command, bodies are created; His Command
        cannot be described. By His Command, souls come into being; by
        His Command, glory and greatness are obtained. By His Command,
        some are high and some are low; by His Written Command, pain and
        pleasure are obtained. Some, by His Command, are blessed and forgiven;
        others, by His Command, wander aimlessly forever. Everyone is
        subject to His Command; no one is beyond His Command. O Nanak,
        one who understands His Command, does not speak in ego.  || 2
        ||   Some sing of His Power-who has that Power? Some sing
        of His Gifts, and know His Sign and Insignia. Some sing of His
        Glorious Virtues, Greatness and Beauty. Some sing of knowledge
        obtained of Him, through difficult philosophical studies. Some
        sing that He fashions the body, and then again reduces it to dust.
        Some sing that He takes life away, and then again restores it. <br>

      <p> Some sing that He seems so very far away. Some sing that He watches
        over us, face to face, ever-present. There is no shortage of those
        who preach and teach. Millions upon millions offer millions of
        sermons and stories. The Great Giver keeps on giving, while those
        who receive grow weary of receiving. Throughout the ages, consumers
        consume. The Commander, by His Command, leads us to walk on the
        Path. O Nanak, He blossoms forth, Carefree and Untroubled.  ||
        3 ||   True is the Master, True is His Name-speak it with
        infinite love. People beg and pray, &quot;Give to us, give to
        us&quot;, and the Great Giver gives His Gifts. So what offering
        can we place before Him, by which we might see the Darbaar of
        His Court? What words can we speak to evoke His Love? In the Amrit
        Vaylaa, the ambrosial hours before dawn, chant the True Name,
        and contemplate His Glorious Greatness. By the karma of past actions,
        the robe of this physical body is obtained. By His Grace, the
        Gate of Liberation is found. O Nanak, know this well: the True
        One Himself is All.  || 4 ||   He cannot be established, He cannot
        be created. He Himself is Immaculate and Pure. Those who serve
        Him are honored. O Nanak, sing of the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence.
        Sing, and listen, and let your mind be filled with love. Your
        pain shall be sent far away, and peace shall come to your home.
        The Guru's Word is the Sound-current of the Naad; the Guru's
        Word is the Wisdom of the Vedas; the Guru's Word is all-pervading.
        The Guru is Shiva, the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is
        Paarvati and Lakhshmi. Even knowing God, I cannot describe Him;
        He cannot be described in words. The Guru has given me this one
        understanding: there is only the One, the Giver of all souls.
        May I never forget Him!  || 5 ||   If I am pleasing to Him, then
        that is my pilgrimage and cleansing bath. Without pleasing Him,
        what good are ritual cleansings? I gaze upon all the created beings:
        without the karma of good actions, what are they given to receive?
        Within the mind are gems, jewels and rubies, if you listen to
        the Guru's Teachings, even once. The Guru has given me
        this one understanding: there is only the One, the Giver of all
        souls. May I never forget Him!  || 6 ||   Even if you could live
        throughout the four ages, or even ten times more, and even if
        you were known throughout the nine continents and followed by
        all, with a good name and reputation, with praise and fame throughout
        the world-still, if the Lord does not bless you with His
        Glance of Grace, then who cares? What is the use? Among worms,
        you would be considered a lowly worm, and even contemptible sinners
        would hold you in contempt. O Nanak, God blesses the unworthy
        with virtue, and bestows virtue on the virtuous. No one can even
        imagine anyone who can bestow virtue upon Him.  || 7 ||   Listening-the
        Siddhas, the spiritual teachers, the heroic warriors, the yogic
        masters. Listening-the earth, its support and the Akaashic
        ethers. Listening-the oceans, the lands of the world and
        the nether regions of the underworld. Listening-Death cannot
        even touch you. O Nanak, the devotees are forever in bliss. Listening-pain
        and sin are erased.  || 8 ||   Listening-Shiva, Brahma
        and Indra. Listening-even foul-mouthed people praise Him.
        Listening-the technology of Yoga and the secrets of the
        body. Listening-the Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas.
        O Nanak, the devotees are forever in bliss. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Listening-pain and sin are erased.  || 9 ||   Listening-truth,
        contentment and spiritual wisdom. Listening-take your cleansing
        bath at the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage. Listening-reading
        and reciting, honor is obtained. Listening-intuitively
        grasp the essence of meditation. O Nanak, the devotees are forever
        in bliss. Listening-pain and sin are erased.  || 10 ||
        Listening-dive deep into the ocean of virtue. Listening-the
        Shaykhs, religious scholars, spiritual teachers and emperors.
        Listening-even the blind find the Path. Listening-the
        Unreachable comes within your grasp. O Nanak, the devotees are
        forever in bliss. Listening-pain and sin are erased.  ||
        11 ||   The state of the faithful cannot be described. One who
        tries to describe this shall regret the attempt. No paper, no
        pen, no scribe can record the state of the faithful. Such is the
        Name of the Immaculate Lord. Only one who has faith comes to know
        such a state of mind.  || 12 ||   The faithful have intuitive
        awareness and intelligence. The faithful know about all worlds
        and realms. The faithful shall never be struck across the face.
        The faithful do not have to go with the Messenger of Death. Such
        is the Name of the Immaculate Lord. Only one who has faith comes
        to know such a state of mind.  || 13 ||   The path of the faithful
        shall never be blocked. The faithful shall depart with honor and
        fame. The faithful do not follow empty religious rituals. The
        faithful are firmly bound to the Dharma. Such is the Name of the
        Immaculate Lord. Only one who has faith comes to know such a state
        of mind.  || 14 ||   The faithful find the Door of Liberation.
        The faithful uplift and redeem their family and relations. The
        faithful are saved, and carried across with the Sikhs of the Guru.
        The faithful, O Nanak, do not wander around begging. Such is the
        Name of the Immaculate Lord. Only one who has faith comes to know
        such a state of mind.  || 15 ||   The chosen ones, the self-elect,
        are accepted and approved. The chosen ones are honored in the
        Court of the Lord. The chosen ones look beautiful in the courts
        of kings. The chosen ones meditate single-mindedly on the Guru.
        No matter how much anyone tries to explain and describe them,
        the actions of the Creator cannot be counted. The mythical bull
        is Dharma, the son of compassion; this is what patiently holds
        the earth in its place. One who understands this becomes truthful.
        What a great load there is on the bull! So many worlds beyond
        this world-so very many! What power holds them, and supports
        their weight? The names and the colors of the assorted species
        of beings were all inscribed by the Ever-flowing Pen of God. Who
        knows how to write this account? Just imagine what a huge scroll
        it would take! What power! What fascinating beauty! And what gifts!
        Who can know their extent? You created the vast expanse of the
        Universe with One Word! Hundreds of thousands of rivers began
        to flow. How can Your Creative Potency be described? I cannot
        even once be a sacrifice to You. Whatever pleases You is the only
        good done, You, Eternal and Formless One!  || 16 ||   Countless
        meditations, countless loves. Countless worship services, countless
        austere disciplines. Countless scriptures, and ritual recitations
        of the Vedas. Countless Yogis, whose minds remain detached from
        the world. <br>

      <p> Countless devotees contemplate the Wisdom and Virtues of the Lord.
        Countless the holy, countless the givers. Countless heroic spiritual
        warriors, who bear the brunt of the attack in battle (who with
        their mouths eat steel). Countless silent sages, vibrating the
        String of His Love. How can Your Creative Potency be described?
        I cannot even once be a sacrifice to You. Whatever pleases You
        is the only good done, You, Eternal and Formless One.  || 17 ||
        Countless fools, blinded by ignorance. Countless thieves and
        embezzlers. Countless impose their will by force. Countless cut-throats
        and ruthless killers. Countless sinners who keep on sinning. Countless
        liars, wandering lost in their lies. Countless wretches, eating
        filth as their ration. Countless slanderers, carrying the weight
        of their stupid mistakes on their heads. Nanak describes the state
        of the lowly. I cannot even once be a sacrifice to You. Whatever
        pleases You is the only good done, You, Eternal and Formless One.
        || 18 ||   Countless names, countless places. Inaccessible, unapproachable,
        countless celestial realms. Even to call them countless is to
        carry the weight on your head. From the Word, comes the Naam;
        from the Word, comes Your Praise. From the Word, comes spiritual
        wisdom, singing the Songs of Your Glory. From the Word, come the
        written and spoken words and hymns. From the Word, comes destiny,
        written on one's forehead. But the One who wrote these
        Words of Destiny-no words are written on His Forehead.
        As He ordains, so do we receive. The created universe is the manifestation
        of Your Name. Without Your Name, there is no place at all. How
        can I describe Your Creative Power? I cannot even once be a sacrifice
        to You. Whatever pleases You is the only good done, You, Eternal
        and Formless One.  || 19 ||   When the hands and the feet and
        the body are dirty, water can wash away the dirt. When the clothes
        are soiled and stained by urine, soap can wash them clean. But
        when the intellect is stained and polluted by sin, it can only
        be cleansed by the Love of the Name. Virtue and vice do not come
        by mere words; actions repeated, over and over again, are engraved
        on the soul. You shall harvest what you plant. O Nanak, by the
        Hukam of God's Command, we come and go in reincarnation.
        || 20 ||   Pilgrimages, austere discipline, compassion and charity-these,
        by themselves, bring only an iota of merit. Listening and believing
        with love and humility in your mind, cleanse yourself with the
        Name, at the sacred shrine deep within. All virtues are Yours,
        Lord, I have none at all. Without virtue, there is no devotional
        worship. I bow to the Lord of the World, to His Word, to Brahma
        the Creator. He is Beautiful, True and Eternally Joyful. What
        was that time, and what was that moment? What was that day, and
        what was that date? What was that season, and what was that month,
        when the Universe was created? The Pandits, the religious scholars,
        cannot find that time, even if it is written in the Puraanas.
        That time is not known to the Qazis, who study the Koran. The
        day and the date are not known to the Yogis, nor is the month
        or the season. The Creator who created this creation-only
        He Himself knows. How can we speak of Him? How can we praise Him? <br>

      <p> How can we describe Him? How can we know Him? O Nanak, everyone
        speaks of Him, each one wiser than the rest. Great is the Master,
        Great is His Name. Whatever happens is according to His Will.
        O Nanak, one who claims to know everything shall not be decorated
        in the world hereafter.  || 21 ||   There are nether worlds beneath
        nether worlds, and hundreds of thousands of heavenly worlds above.
        The Vedas say that you can search and search for them all, until
        you grow weary. The scriptures say that there are 18,000 worlds,
        but in reality, there is only One Universe. If you try to write
        an account of this, you will surely finish yourself before you
        finish writing it. O Nanak, call Him Great! He Himself knows Himself.
        || 22 ||   The praisers praise the Lord, but they do not obtain
        intuitive understanding-the streams and rivers flowing
        into the ocean do not know its vastness. Even kings and emperors,
        with mountains of property and oceans of wealth-these are
        not even equal to an ant, who does not forget God.  || 23 || 
        Endless are His Praises, endless are those who speak them. Endless
        are His Actions, endless are His Gifts. Endless is His Vision,
        endless is His Hearing. His limits cannot be perceived. What is
        the Mystery of His Mind? The limits of the created universe cannot
        be perceived. Its limits here and beyond cannot be perceived.
        Many struggle to know His limits, but His limits cannot be found.
        No one can know these limits. The more you say about them, the
        more there still remains to be said. Great is the Master, High
        is His Heavenly Home. Highest of the High, above all is His Name.
        Only one as Great and as High as God can know His Lofty and Exalted
        State. Only He Himself is that Great. He Himself knows Himself.
        O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace, He bestows His Blessings.  ||
        24 ||   His Blessings are so abundant that there can be no written
        account of them. The Great Giver does not hold back anything.
        There are so many great, heroic warriors begging at the Door of
        the Infinite Lord. So many contemplate and dwell upon Him, that
        they cannot be counted. So many waste away to death engaged in
        corruption. So many take and take again, and then deny receiving.
        So many foolish consumers keep on consuming. So many endure distress,
        deprivation and constant abuse. Even these are Your Gifts, O Great
        Giver! Liberation from bondage comes only by Your Will. No one
        else has any say in this. If some fool should presume to say that
        he does, he shall learn, and feel the effects of his folly. He
        Himself knows, He Himself gives. Few, very few are those who acknowledge
        this. One who is blessed to sing the Praises of the Lord, O Nanak,
        is the king of kings.  || 25 ||   Priceless are His Virtues, Priceless
        are His Dealings. Priceless are His Dealers, Priceless are His
        Treasures. Priceless are those who come to Him, Priceless are
        those who buy from Him. Priceless is Love for Him, Priceless is
        absorption into Him. Priceless is the Divine Law of Dharma, Priceless
        is the Divine Court of Justice. Priceless are the scales, priceless
        are the weights. Priceless are His Blessings, Priceless is His
        Banner and Insignia. Priceless is His Mercy, Priceless is His
        Royal Command. Priceless, O Priceless beyond expression! Speak
        of Him continually, and remain absorbed in His Love. The Vedas
        and the Puraanas speak. The scholars speak and lecture. Brahma
        speaks, Indra speaks. <br>

      <p> The Gopis and Krishna speak. Shiva speaks, the Siddhas speak.
        The many created Buddhas speak. The demons speak, the demi-gods
        speak. The spiritual warriors, the heavenly beings, the silent
        sages, the humble and serviceful speak. Many speak and try to
        describe Him. Many have spoken of Him over and over again, and
        have then arisen and departed. If He were to create as many again
        as there already are, even then, they could not describe Him.
        He is as Great as He wishes to be. O Nanak, the True Lord knows.
        If anyone presumes to describe God, he shall be known as the greatest
        fool of fools!  || 26 ||   Where is that Gate, and where is that
        Dwelling, in which You sit and take care of all? The Sound-current
        of the Naad vibrates there, and countless musicians play on all
        sorts of instruments there. So many Ragas, so many musicians singing
        there. The praanic wind, water and fire sing; the Righteous Judge
        of Dharma sings at Your Door. Chitr and Gupt, the angels of the
        conscious and the subconscious who record actions, and the Righteous
        Judge of Dharma who judges this record sing. Shiva, Brahma and
        the Goddess of Beauty, ever adorned, sing. Indra, seated upon
        His Throne, sings with the deities at Your Door. The Siddhas in
        Samaadhi sing; the Saadhus sing in contemplation. The celibates,
        the fanatics, the peacefully accepting and the fearless warriors
        sing. The Pandits, the religious scholars who recite the Vedas,
        with the supreme sages of all the ages, sing. The Mohinis, the
        enchanting heavenly beauties who entice hearts in this world,
        in paradise, and in the underworld of the subconscious sing. The
        celestial jewels created by You, and the sixty-eight holy places
        of pilgrimage sing. The brave and mighty warriors sing; the spiritual
        heroes and the four sources of creation sing. The planets, solar
        systems and galaxies, created and arranged by Your Hand, sing.
        They alone sing, who are pleasing to Your Will. Your devotees
        are imbued with the Nectar of Your Essence. So many others sing,
        they do not come to mind. O Nanak, how can I consider them all?
        That True Lord is True, Forever True, and True is His Name. He
        is, and shall always be. He shall not depart, even when this Universe
        which He has created departs. He created the world, with its various
        colors, species of beings, and the variety of Maya. Having created
        the creation, He watches over it Himself, by His Greatness. He
        does whatever He pleases. No order can be issued to Him. He is
        the King, the King of kings, the Supreme Lord and Master of kings.
        Nanak remains subject to His Will.  || 27 ||   Make contentment
        your ear-rings, humility your begging bowl, and meditation the
        ashes you apply to your body. Let the remembrance of death be
        the patched coat you wear, let the purity of virginity be your
        way in the world, and let faith in the Lord be your walking stick.
        See the brotherhood of all mankind as the highest order of Yogis;
        conquer your own mind, and conquer the world. I bow to Him, I
        humbly bow. The Primal One, the Pure Light, without beginning,
        without end. Throughout all the ages, He is One and the Same.
        || 28 ||   Let spiritual wisdom be your food, and compassion
        your attendant. The Sound-current of the Naad vibrates in each
        and every heart. He Himself is the Supreme Master of all; wealth
        and miraculous spiritual powers, and all other external tastes
        and pleasures, are all like beads on a string. Union with Him,
        and separation from Him, come by His Will. <br>

      <p> We come to receive what is written in our destiny. I bow to Him,
        I humbly bow. The Primal One, the Pure Light, without beginning,
        without end. Throughout all the ages, He is One and the Same.
        || 29 ||   The One Divine Mother conceived and gave birth to
        the three deities. One, the Creator of the World; One, the Sustainer;
        and One, the Destroyer. He makes things happen according to the
        Pleasure of His Will. Such is His Celestial Order. He watches
        over all, but none see Him. How wonderful this is! I bow to Him,
        I humbly bow. The Primal One, the Pure Light, without beginning,
        without end. Throughout all the ages, He is One and the Same.
        || 30 ||   On world after world are His Seats of Authority and
        His Storehouses. Whatever was put into them, was put there once
        and for all. Having created the creation, the Creator Lord watches
        over it. O Nanak, True is the Creation of the True Lord. I bow
        to Him, I humbly bow. The Primal One, the Pure Light, without
        beginning, without end. Throughout all the ages, He is One and
        the Same.  || 31 ||   If I had 100,000 tongues, and these were
        then multiplied twenty times more, with each tongue, I would repeat,
        hundreds of thousands of times, the Name of the One, the Lord
        of the Universe. Along this path to our Husband Lord, we climb
        the steps of the ladder, and come to merge with Him. Hearing of
        the etheric realms, even worms long to come back home. O Nanak,
        by His Grace He is obtained. False are the boastings of the false.
        || 32 ||   No power to speak, no power to keep silent. No power
        to beg, no power to give. No power to live, no power to die. No
        power to rule, with wealth and occult mental powers. No power
        to gain intuitive understanding, spiritual wisdom and meditation.
        No power to find the way to escape from the world. He alone has
        the Power in His Hands. He watches over all. O Nanak, no one is
        high or low.  || 33 ||   Nights, days, weeks and seasons; wind,
        water, fire and the nether regions-in the midst of these,
        He established the earth as a home for Dharma. Upon it, He placed
        the various species of beings. Their names are uncounted and endless.
        By their deeds and their actions, they shall be judged. God Himself
        is True, and True is His Court. There, in perfect grace and ease,
        sit the self-elect, the self-realized Saints. They receive the
        Mark of Grace from the Merciful Lord. The ripe and the unripe,
        the good and the bad, shall there be judged. O Nanak, when you
        go home, you will see this.  || 34 ||   This is righteous living
        in the realm of Dharma. And now we speak of the realm of spiritual
        wisdom. So many winds, waters and fires; so many Krishnas and
        Shivas. So many Brahmas, fashioning forms of great beauty, adorned
        and dressed in many colors. So many worlds and lands for working
        out karma. So very many lessons to be learned! So many Indras,
        so many moons and suns, so many worlds and lands. So many Siddhas
        and Buddhas, so many Yogic masters. So many goddesses of various
        kinds. So many demi-gods and demons, so many silent sages. So
        many oceans of jewels. So many ways of life, so many languages.
        So many dynasties of rulers. So many intuitive people, so many
        selfless servants. O Nanak, His limit has no limit!  || 35 ||
        In the realm of wisdom, spiritual wisdom reigns supreme. The
        Sound-current of the Naad vibrates there, amidst the sounds and
        the sights of bliss. <br>

      <p> In the realm of humility, the Word is Beauty. Forms of incomparable
        beauty are fashioned there. These things cannot be described.
        One who tries to speak of these shall regret the attempt. The
        intuitive consciousness, intellect and understanding of the mind
        are shaped there. The consciousness of the spiritual warriors
        and the Siddhas, the beings of spiritual perfection, are shaped
        there.  || 36 ||   In the realm of karma, the Word is Power. No
        one else dwells there, except the warriors of great power, the
        spiritual heroes. They are totally fulfilled, imbued with the
        Lord's Essence. Myriads of Sitas are there, cool and calm
        in their majestic glory. Their beauty cannot be described. Neither
        death nor deception comes to those, within whose minds the Lord
        abides. The devotees of many worlds dwell there. They celebrate;
        their minds are imbued with the True Lord. In the realm of Truth,
        the Formless Lord abides. Having created the creation, He watches
        over it. By His Glance of Grace, He bestows happiness. There are
        planets, solar systems and galaxies. If one speaks of them, there
        is no limit, no end. There are worlds upon worlds of His Creation.
        As He commands, so they exist. He watches over all, and contemplating
        the creation, He rejoices. O Nanak, to describe this is as hard
        as steel!  || 37 ||   Let self-control be the furnace, and patience
        the goldsmith. Let understanding be the anvil, and spiritual wisdom
        the tools. With the Fear of God as the bellows, fan the flames
        of tapa, the body's inner heat. In the crucible of love,
        melt the Nectar of the Name, and mint the True Coin of the Shabad,
        the Word of God. Such is the karma of those upon whom He has cast
        His Glance of Grace. O Nanak, the Merciful Lord, by His Grace,
        uplifts and exalts them.  || 38 ||   SHALOK:  Air is the Guru,
        Water is the Father, and Earth is the Great Mother of all. Day
        and night are the two nurses, in whose lap all the world is at
        play. Good deeds and bad deeds-the record is read out in
        the Presence of the Lord of Dharma. According to their own actions,
        some are drawn closer, and some are driven farther away. Those
        who have meditated on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and departed
        after having worked by the sweat of their brows-O Nanak,
        their faces are radiant in the Court of the Lord, and many are
        saved along with them!  || 1 || <br>

        everyone calls Him Great. But just how Great His Greatness is-this
        is known only to those who have seen Him. His Value cannot be

        Please be merciful, and bless me with the Light of the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O my Best Friend, O Divine Guru,
        please enlighten me with the Name of the Lord. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, the Naam is my breath of life. The Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praise is my life's occupation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        servants of the Lord have the greatest good fortune; they have

        of the Lord, Har, Har, they are satisfied; joining the Sangat,
        the Blessed Congregation, their virtues shine forth.  || 2 ||
        Those who have not obtained the Sublime Essence of the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, are most unfortunate; they are led

        Sanctuary of the True Guru and the Sangat, the Holy Congregation-cursed
        are their lives, and cursed are their hopes of life.  || 3 ||
        Those humble servants of the Lord who have attained the Company
        of the True Guru, have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed on
        their foreheads. Blessed, blessed is the Sat Sangat, the True
        Congregation, where the Lord's Essence is obtained. Meeting

        do you plot and plan, when the Dear Lord Himself provides for
        your care? From rocks and stones He created living beings; He
        places their nourishment before them.  || 1 ||   O my Dear Lord
        of souls, one who joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
        is saved. By Guru's Grace, the supreme status is obtained,
        and the dry wood blossoms forth again in lush greenery.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Mothers, fathers, friends, children and spouses-no
        one is the support of anyone else. For each and every person,
        our Lord and Master provides sustenance. Why are you so afraid,
        O mind?  || 2 ||   The flamingoes fly hundreds of miles, leaving
        their young ones behind. Who feeds them, and who teaches them
        to feed themselves? Have you ever thought of this in your mind?

        powers are held by our Lord and Master in the Palm of His Hand.
        Servant Nanak is devoted, dedicated, forever a sacrifice to You,

        after age, You are the One. Forever and ever, You are the One.
        You never change, O Creator Lord. Everything happens according
        to Your Will. You Yourself accomplish all that occurs. You Yourself
        created the entire universe, and having fashioned it, You Yourself
        shall destroy it all. Servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Dear Creator, the Knower of all.  || 5 || 1 ||   AASAA,
        FOURTH MEHL:  You are the True Creator, my Lord and Master. Whatever
        pleases You comes to pass. As You give, so do we receive.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   All belong to You, all meditate on you. Those
        who are blessed with Your Mercy obtain the Jewel of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. The Gurmukhs obtain it, and the self-willed
        manmukhs lose it. You Yourself separate them from Yourself, and
        You Yourself reunite with them again.  || 1 ||   You are the River
        of Life; all are within You. There is no one except You. All living
        beings are Your playthings. The separated ones meet, and by great
        good fortune, those suffering in separation are reunited once
        again.  || 2 ||   They alone understand, whom You inspire to understand;
        they continually chant and repeat the Lord's Praises. Those
        who serve You find peace. <br>

      <p> They are intuitively absorbed into the Lord's Name.  ||
        3 ||   You Yourself are the Creator. Everything that happens is
        by Your Doing. There is no one except You. You created the creation;
        You behold it and understand it. O servant Nanak, the Lord is
        revealed through the Gurmukh, the Living Expression of the Guru's
        Word.  || 4 || 2 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  In that pool, people
        have made their homes, but the water there is as hot as fire!
        In the swamp of emotional attachment, their feet cannot move.
        I have seen them drowning there.  || 1 ||   In your mind, you
        do not remember the One Lord-you fool! You have forgotten
        the Lord; your virtues shall wither away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        I am not celibate, nor truthful, nor scholarly. I was born foolish
        and ignorant into this world. Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary
        of those who have not forgotten You, O Lord!  || 2 || 3 ||   AASAA,
        FIFTH MEHL:  This human body has been given to you. This is your
        chance to meet the Lord of the Universe. Nothing else will work.
        Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; vibrate and meditate
        on the Jewel of the Naam.  || 1 ||   Make every effort to cross
        over this terrifying world-ocean. You are squandering this life
        uselessly in the love of Maya.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have not
        practiced meditation, self-discipline, self-restraint or righteous
        living. I have not served the Holy; I have not acknowledged the
        Lord, my King. Says Nanak, my actions are contemptible! O Lord,
        I seek Your Sanctuary; please, preserve my honor!  || 2 || 4 || <br>

        Come, gather together and pour the oil over the threshold. My

        every heart, this summons is sent out; the call comes each and
        every day. Remember in meditation the One who summons us; O Nanak,
        that day is drawing near!  || 4 || 1 ||   RAAG AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:
        There are six schools of philosophy, six teachers, and six sets
        of teachings. But the Teacher of teachers is the One, who appears
        in so many forms.  || 1 ||   O Baba: that system in which the
        Praises of the Creator are sung-follow that system; in
        it rests true greatness.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The seconds, minutes
        and hours, days, weeks and months, and the various seasons originate
        from the one sun; <br>

      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the
        Creator.  || 2 || 2 ||   RAAG DHANAASAREE,  FIRST MEHL:  Upon
        that cosmic plate of the sky, the sun and the moon are the lamps.
        The stars and their orbs are the studded pearls. The fragrance
        of sandalwood in the air is the temple incense, and the wind is
        the fan. All the plants of the world are the altar flowers in
        offering to You, O Luminous Lord.  || 1 ||   What a beautiful
        Aartee, lamp-lit worship service this is! O Destroyer of Fear,
        this is Your Ceremony of Light. The Unstruck Sound-current of
        the Shabad is the vibration of the temple drums.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   You have thousands of eyes, and yet You have no eyes. You
        have thousands of forms, and yet You do not have even one. You
        have thousands of Lotus Feet, and yet You do not have even one
        foot. You have no nose, but you have thousands of noses. This
        Play of Yours entrances me.  || 2 ||   Amongst all is the Light-You
        are that Light. By this Illumination, that Light is radiant within
        all. Through the Guru's Teachings, the Light shines forth.
        That which is pleasing to Him is the lamp-lit worship service.
        || 3 ||   My mind is enticed by the honey-sweet Lotus Feet of
        the Lord. Day and night, I thirst for them. Bestow the Water of
        Your Mercy upon Nanak, the thirsty song-bird, so that he may come
        to dwell in Your Name.  || 4 || 3 ||   RAAG GAUREE POORBEE,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  The body-village is filled to overflowing with anger and
        sexual desire; these were broken into bits when I met with the
        Holy Saint. By pre-ordained destiny, I have met with the Guru.
        I have entered into the realm of the Lord's Love.  || 1
        ||   Greet the Holy Saint with your palms pressed together; this
        is an act of great merit. Bow down before Him; this is a virtuous
        action indeed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The wicked shaaktas, the
        faithless cynics, do not know the Taste of the Lord's Sublime
        Essence. The thorn of egotism is embedded deep within them. The
        more they walk away, the deeper it pierces them, and the more
        they suffer in pain, until finally, the Messenger of Death smashes
        his club against their heads.  || 2 ||   The humble servants of
        the Lord are absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The pain
        of birth and the fear of death are eradicated. They have found
        the Imperishable Supreme Being, the Transcendent Lord God, and
        they receive great honor throughout all the worlds and realms.
        || 3 ||   I am poor and meek, God, but I belong to You! Save
        me-please save me, O Greatest of the Great! Servant Nanak
        takes the Sustenance and Support of the Naam. In the Name of the
        Lord, he enjoys celestial peace.  || 4 || 4 ||   RAAG GAUREE POORBEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Listen, my friends, I beg of you: now is the time
        to serve the Saints! In this world, earn the profit of the Lord's
        Name, and hereafter, you shall dwell in peace.  || 1 ||   This
        life is diminishing, day and night. Meeting with the Guru, your
        affairs shall be resolved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This world is
        engrossed in corruption and cynicism. Only those who know God
        are saved. Only those who are awakened by the Lord to drink in
        this Sublime Essence, come to know the Unspoken Speech of the
        Lord.  || 2 ||   Purchase only that for which you have come into
        the world, and through the Guru, the Lord shall dwell within your
        mind. Within the home of your own inner being, you shall obtain
        the Mansion of the Lord's Presence with intuitive ease.
        You shall not be consigned again to the wheel of reincarnation.
        || 3 ||   O Inner-knower, Searcher of Hearts, O Primal Being,
        Architect of Destiny: please fulfill this yearning of my mind.
        Nanak, Your slave, begs for this happiness: let me be the dust
        of the feet of the Saints.  || 4 || 5 || <br>
