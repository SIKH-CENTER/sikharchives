      <p> O Nanak, in the Company of the Holy, one's life becomes fruitful.
        || 5 ||   In the Company of the Holy, there is no suffering.
        The Blessed Vision of their Darshan brings a sublime, happy peace.
        In the Company of the Holy, blemishes are removed. In the Company
        of the Holy, hell is far away. In the Company of the Holy, one
        is happy here and hereafter. In the Company of the Holy, the separated
        ones are reunited with the Lord. The fruits of one's desires
        are obtained. In the Company of the Holy, no one goes empty-handed.
        The Supreme Lord God dwells in the hearts of the Holy. O Nanak,
        listening to the sweet words of the Holy, one is saved.  || 6
        ||   In the Company of the Holy, listen to the Name of the Lord.
        In the Company of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        In the Company of the Holy, do not forget Him from your mind.
        In the Company of the Holy, you shall surely be saved. In the
        Company of the Holy, God seems very sweet. In the Company of the
        Holy, He is seen in each and every heart. In the Company of the
        Holy, we become obedient to the Lord. In the Company of the Holy,
        we obtain the state of salvation. In the Company of the Holy,
        all diseases are cured. O Nanak, one meets with the Holy, by highest
        destiny.  || 7 ||   The glory of the Holy people is not known
        to the Vedas. They can describe only what they have heard. The
        greatness of the Holy people is beyond the three qualities. The
        greatness of the Holy people is all-pervading. The glory of the
        Holy people has no limit. The glory of the Holy people is infinite
        and eternal. The glory of the Holy people is the highest of the
        high. The glory of the Holy people is the greatest of the great.
        The glory of the Holy people is theirs alone; O Nanak, there is
        no difference between the Holy people and God.  || 8 || 7 || 
        SHALOK:  The True One is on his mind, and the True One is upon
        his lips. He sees only the One. O Nanak, these are the qualities
        of the God-conscious being.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  The God-conscious
        being is always unattached, as the lotus in the water remains
        detached. The God-conscious being is always unstained, like the
        sun, which gives its comfort and warmth to all. The God-conscious
        being looks upon all alike, like the wind, which blows equally
        upon the king and the poor beggar. The God-conscious being has
        a steady patience, like the earth, which is dug up by one, and
        anointed with sandal paste by another. This is the quality of
        the God-conscious being: O Nanak, his inherent nature is like
        a warming fire.  || 1 ||   The God-conscious being is the purest
        of the pure; filth does not stick to water. The God-conscious
        being's mind is enlightened, like the sky above the earth.
        To the God-conscious being, friend and foe are the same. The God-conscious
        being has no egotistical pride. The God-conscious being is the
        highest of the high. Within his own mind, he is the most humble
        of all. They alone become God-conscious beings, O Nanak, whom
        God Himself makes so.  || 2 ||   The God-conscious being is the
        dust of all. The God-conscious being knows the nature of the soul.
        The God-conscious being shows kindness to all. No evil comes from
        the God-conscious being. The God-conscious being is always impartial. </p>

      <p> Nectar rains down from the glance of the God-conscious being.
        The God-conscious being is free from entanglements. The lifestyle
        of the God-conscious being is spotlessly pure. Spiritual wisdom
        is the food of the God-conscious being. O Nanak, the God-conscious
        being is absorbed in God's meditation.  || 3 ||   The God-conscious
        being centers his hopes on the One alone. The God-conscious being
        shall never perish. The God-conscious being is steeped in humility.
        The God-conscious being delights in doing good to others. The
        God-conscious being has no worldly entanglements. The God-conscious
        being holds his wandering mind under control. The God-conscious
        being acts in the common good. The God-conscious being blossoms
        in fruitfulness. In the Company of the God-conscious being, all
        are saved. O Nanak, through the God-conscious being, the whole
        world meditates on God.  || 4 ||   The God-conscious being loves
        the One Lord alone. The God-conscious being dwells with God. The
        God-conscious being takes the Naam as his Support. The God-conscious
        being has the Naam as his Family. The God-conscious being is awake
        and aware, forever and ever. The God-conscious being renounces
        his proud ego. In the mind of the God-conscious being, there is
        supreme bliss. In the home of the God-conscious being, there is
        everlasting bliss. The God-conscious being dwells in peaceful
        ease. O Nanak, the God-conscious being shall never perish.  ||
        5 ||   The God-conscious being knows God. The God-conscious being
        is in love with the One alone. The God-conscious being is carefree.
        Pure are the Teachings of the God-conscious being. The God-conscious
        being is made so by God Himself. The God-conscious being is gloriously
        great. The Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the God-conscious being,
        is obtained by great good fortune. To the God-conscious being,
        I make my life a sacrifice. The God-conscious being is sought
        by the great god Shiva. O Nanak, the God-conscious being is Himself
        the Supreme Lord God.  || 6 ||   The God-conscious being cannot
        be appraised. The God-conscious being has all within his mind.
        Who can know the mystery of the God-conscious being? Forever bow
        to the God-conscious being. The God-conscious being cannot be
        described in words. The God-conscious being is the Lord and Master
        of all. Who can describe the limits of the God-conscious being?
        Only the God-conscious being can know the state of the God-conscious
        being. The God-conscious being has no end or limitation. O Nanak,
        to the God-conscious being, bow forever in reverence.  || 7 ||
        The God-conscious being is the Creator of all the world. The
        God-conscious being lives forever, and does not die. The God-conscious
        being is the Giver of the way of liberation of the soul. The God-conscious
        being is the Perfect Supreme Being, who orchestrates all. The
        God-conscious being is the helper of the helpless. The God-conscious
        being extends his hand to all. The God-conscious being owns the
        entire creation. </p>

      <p> The God-conscious being is himself the Formless Lord. The glory
        of the God-conscious being belongs to the God-conscious being
        alone. O Nanak, the God-conscious being is the Lord of all.  ||
        8 || 8 ||   SHALOK:  One who enshrines the Naam within the heart,
        who sees the Lord God in all, who, each and every moment, bows
        in reverence to the Lord Master  -  O Nanak, such a one is
        the true 'touch-nothing Saint', who emancipates everyone.
        || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  One whose tongue does not touch falsehood;
        whose mind is filled with love for the Blessed Vision of the Pure
        Lord, whose eyes do not gaze upon the beauty of others' wives,
        who serves the Holy and loves the Saints' Congregation, whose
        ears do not listen to slander against anyone, who deems himself
        to be the worst of all, who, by Guru's Grace, renounces corruption,
        who banishes the mind's evil desires from his mind, who conquers
        his sexual instincts and is free of the five sinful passions  - 
        O Nanak, among millions, there is scarcely one such 'touch-nothing
        Saint'.  || 1 ||   The true Vaishnaav, the devotee of Vishnu,
        is the one with whom God is thoroughly pleased. He dwells apart
        from Maya. Performing good deeds, he does not seek rewards. Spotlessly
        pure is the religion of such a Vaishnaav; he has no desire for
        the fruits of his labors. He is absorbed in devotional worship
        and the singing of Kirtan, the songs of the Lord's Glory.
        Within his mind and body, he meditates in remembrance on the Lord
        of the Universe. He is kind to all creatures. He holds fast to
        the Naam, and inspires others to chant it. O Nanak, such a Vaishnaav
        obtains the supreme status.  || 2 ||   The true Bhagaautee, the
        devotee of Adi Shakti, loves the devotional worship of God. He
        forsakes the company of all wicked people. All doubts are removed
        from his mind. He performs devotional service to the Supreme Lord
        God in all. In the Company of the Holy, the filth of sin is washed
        away. The wisdom of such a Bhagaautee becomes supreme. He constantly
        performs the service of the Supreme Lord God. He dedicates his
        mind and body to the Love of God. The Lotus Feet of the Lord abide
        in his heart. O Nanak, such a Bhagaautee attains the Lord God.
        || 3 ||   He is a true Pandit, a religious scholar, who instructs
        his own mind. He searches for the Lord's Name within his
        own soul. He drinks in the Exquisite Nectar of the Lord's
        Name. By that Pandit's teachings, the world lives. He implants
        the Sermon of the Lord in his heart. Such a Pandit is not cast
        into the womb of reincarnation again. He understands the fundamental
        essence of the Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees. In the unmanifest,
        he sees the manifest world to exist. He gives instruction to people
        of all castes and social classes. O Nanak, to such a Pandit, I
        bow in salutation forever.  || 4 ||   The Beej Mantra, the Seed
        Mantra, is spiritual wisdom for everyone. Anyone, from any class,
        may chant the Naam. Whoever chants it, is emancipated. And yet,
        rare are those who attain it, in the Company of the Holy. By His
        Grace, He enshrines it within. Even beasts, ghosts and the stone-hearted
        are saved. The Naam is the panacea, the remedy to cure all ills.
        Singing the Glory of God is the embodiment of bliss and emancipation.
        It cannot be obtained by any religious rituals. O Nanak, he alone
        obtains it, whose karma is so pre-ordained.  || 5 || </p>

      <p> One whose mind is a home for the Supreme Lord God  -  his name
        is truly Ram Das, the Lord's servant. He comes to have the
        Vision of the Lord, the Supreme Soul. Deeming himself to be the
        slave of the Lord's slaves, he obtains it. He knows the Lord
        to be Ever-present, close at hand. Such a servant is honored in
        the Court of the Lord. To His servant, He Himself shows His Mercy.
        Such a servant understands everything. Amidst all, his soul is
        unattached. Such is the way, O Nanak, of the Lord's servant.
        || 6 ||   One who, in his soul, loves the Will of God, is said
        to be Jivan Mukta  -  liberated while yet alive. As is joy,
        so is sorrow to him. He is in eternal bliss, and is not separated
        from God. As is gold, so is dust to him. As is ambrosial nectar,
        so is bitter poison to him. As is honor, so is dishonor. As is
        the beggar, so is the king. Whatever God ordains, that is his
        way. O Nanak, that being is known as Jivan Mukta.  || 7 ||   All
        places belong to the Supreme Lord God. According to the homes
        in which they are placed, so are His creatures named. He Himself
        is the Doer, the Cause of causes. Whatever pleases God, ultimately
        comes to pass. He Himself is All-pervading, in endless waves.
        The playful sport of the Supreme Lord God cannot be known. As
        the understanding is given, so is one enlightened. The Supreme
        Lord God, the Creator, is eternal and everlasting. Forever, forever
        and ever, He is merciful. Remembering Him, remembering Him in
        meditation, O Nanak, one is blessed with ecstasy.  || 8 || 9 ||
        SHALOK:  Many people praise the Lord. He has no end or limitation.
        O Nanak, God created the creation, with its many ways and various
        species.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  Many millions are His devotees.
        Many millions perform religious rituals and worldly duties. Many
        millions become dwellers at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. Many
        millions wander as renunciates in the wilderness. Many millions
        listen to the Vedas. Many millions become austere penitents. Many
        millions enshrine meditation within their souls. Many millions
        of poets contemplate Him through poetry. Many millions meditate
        on His eternally new Naam. O Nanak, none can find the limits of
        the Creator.  || 1 ||   Many millions become self-centered. Many
        millions are blinded by ignorance. Many millions are stone-hearted
        misers. Many millions are heartless, with dry, withered souls.
        Many millions steal the wealth of others. Many millions slander
        others. Many millions struggle in Maya. Many millions wander in
        foreign lands. Whatever God attaches them to  -  with that
        they are engaged. O Nanak, the Creator alone knows the workings
        of His creation.  || 2 ||   Many millions are Siddhas, celibates
        and Yogis. Many millions are kings, enjoying worldly pleasures.
        Many millions of birds and snakes have been created. Many millions
        of stones and trees have been produced. Many millions are the
        winds, waters and fires. Many millions are the countries and realms
        of the world. Many millions are the moons, suns and stars. </p>

      <p> Many millions are the demi-gods, demons and Indras, under their
        regal canopies. He has strung the entire creation upon His thread.
        O Nanak, He emancipates those with whom He is pleased.  || 3 ||
        Many millions abide in heated activity, slothful darkness and
        peaceful light. Many millions are the Vedas, Puraanas, Simritees
        and Shaastras. Many millions are the pearls of the oceans. Many
        millions are the beings of so many descriptions. Many millions
        are made long-lived. Many millions of hills and mountains have
        been made of gold. Many millions are the Yakhshas  -  the servants
        of the god of wealth, the Kinnars  -  the gods of celestial
        music, and the evil spirits of the Pisaach. Many millions are
        the evil nature-spirits, ghosts, pigs and tigers. He is near to
        all, and yet far from all; O Nanak, He Himself remains distinct,
        while yet pervading all.  || 4 ||   Many millions inhabit the
        nether regions. Many millions dwell in heaven and hell. Many millions
        are born, live and die. Many millions are reincarnated, over and
        over again. Many millions eat while sitting at ease. Many millions
        are exhausted by their labors. Many millions are created wealthy.
        Many millions are anxiously involved in Maya. Wherever He wills,
        there He keeps us. O Nanak, everything is in the Hands of God.
        || 5 ||   Many millions become Bairaagees, who renounce the world.
        They have attached themselves to the Lord's Name. Many millions
        are searching for God. Within their souls, they find the Supreme
        Lord God. Many millions thirst for the Blessing of God's
        Darshan. They meet with God, the Eternal. Many millions pray for
        the Society of the Saints. They are imbued with the Love of the
        Supreme Lord God. Those with whom He Himself is pleased, O Nanak,
        are blessed, forever blessed.  || 6 ||   Many millions are the
        fields of creation and the galaxies. Many millions are the etheric
        skies and the solar systems. Many millions are the divine incarnations.
        In so many ways, He has unfolded Himself. So many times, He has
        expanded His expansion. Forever and ever, He is the One, the One
        Universal Creator. Many millions are created in various forms.
        From God they emanate, and into God they merge once again. His
        limits are not known to anyone. Of Himself, and by Himself, O
        Nanak, God exists.  || 7 ||   Many millions are the servants of
        the Supreme Lord God. Their souls are enlightened. Many millions
        know the essence of reality. Their eyes gaze forever on the One
        alone. Many millions drink in the essence of the Naam. They become
        immortal; they live forever and ever. Many millions sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Naam. They are absorbed in intuitive peace and
        pleasure. He remembers His servants with each and every breath.
        O Nanak, they are the beloveds of the Transcendent Lord God. 
        || 8 || 10 ||   SHALOK:  God alone is the Doer of deeds  - 
        there is no other at all. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the One,
        who pervades the waters, the lands, the sky and all space.  ||
        1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  The Doer, the Cause of causes, is potent to
        do anything. That which pleases Him, comes to pass. In an instant,
        He creates and destroys. </p>

      <p> He has no end or limitation. By His Order, He established the
        earth, and He maintains it unsupported. By His Order, the world
        was created; by His Order, it shall merge again into Him. By His
        Order, one's occupation is high or low. By His Order, there
        are so many colors and forms. Having created the Creation, He
        beholds His own greatness. O Nanak, He is pervading in all.  ||
        1 ||   If it pleases God, one attains salvation. If it pleases
        God, then even stones can swim. If it pleases God, the body is
        preserved, even without the breath of life. If it pleases God,
        then one chants the Lord's Glorious Praises. If it pleases
        God, then even sinners are saved. He Himself acts, and He Himself
        contemplates. He Himself is the Master of both worlds. He plays
        and He enjoys; He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
        As He wills, He causes actions to be done. Nanak sees no other
        than Him.  || 2 ||   Tell me  -  what can a mere mortal do?
        Whatever pleases God is what He causes us to do. If it were in
        our hands, we would grab up everything. Whatever pleases God  - 
        that is what He does. Through ignorance, people are engrossed
        in corruption. If they knew better, they would save themselves.
        Deluded by doubt, they wander around in the ten directions. In
        an instant, their minds go around the four corners of the world
        and come back again. Those whom the Lord mercifully blesses with
        His devotional worship  -  O Nanak, they are absorbed into
        the Naam.  || 3 ||   In an instant, the lowly worm is transformed
        into a king. The Supreme Lord God is the Protector of the humble.
        Even one who has never been seen at all, becomes instantly famous
        in the ten directions. And that one upon whom He bestows His blessings
        -  the Lord of the world does not hold him to his account.
        Soul and body are all His property. Each and every heart is illuminated
        by the Perfect Lord God. He Himself fashioned His own handiwork.
        Nanak lives by beholding His greatness.  || 4 ||   There is no
        power in the hands of mortal beings; the Doer, the Cause of causes
        is the Lord of all. The helpless beings are subject to His Command.
        That which pleases Him, ultimately comes to pass. Sometimes, they
        abide in exaltation; sometimes, they are depressed. Sometimes,
        they are sad, and sometimes they laugh with joy and delight. Sometimes,
        they are occupied with slander and anxiety. Sometimes, they are
        high in the Akaashic Ethers, sometimes in the nether regions of
        the underworld. Sometimes, they know the contemplation of God.
        O Nanak, God Himself unites them with Himself.  || 5 ||   Sometimes,
        they dance in various ways. Sometimes, they remain asleep day
        and night. Sometimes, they are awesome, in terrible rage. Sometimes,
        they are the dust of the feet of all. Sometimes, they sit as great
        kings. Sometimes, they wear the coat of a lowly beggar. Sometimes,
        they come to have evil reputations. Sometimes, they are known
        as very, very good. As God keeps them, so they remain. By Guru's
        Grace, O Nanak, the Truth is told.  || 6 ||   Sometimes, as scholars,
        they deliver lectures. Sometimes, they hold to silence in deep
        meditation. Sometimes, they take cleansing baths at places of
        pilgrimage. Sometimes, as Siddhas or seekers, they impart spiritual
        wisdom. Sometimes, they becomes worms, elephants, or moths. They
        may wander and roam through countless incarnations. </p>

      <p> In various costumes, like actors, they appear. As it pleases God,
        they dance. Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass. O Nanak, there
        is no other at all.  || 7 ||   Sometimes, this being attains the
        Company of the Holy. From that place, he does not have to come
        back again. The light of spiritual wisdom dawns within. That place
        does not perish. The mind and body are imbued with the Love of
        the Naam, the Name of the One Lord. He dwells forever with the
        Supreme Lord God. As water comes to blend with water, his light
        blends into the Light. Reincarnation is ended, and eternal peace
        is found. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to God.  || 8 || 11 ||
        SHALOK:  The humble beings abide in peace; subduing egotism,
        they are meek. The very proud and arrogant persons, O Nanak, are
        consumed by their own pride.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  One who has
        the pride of power within, shall dwell in hell, and become a dog.
        One who deems himself to have the beauty of youth, shall become
        a maggot in manure. One who claims to act virtuously, shall live
        and die, wandering through countless reincarnations. One who takes
        pride in wealth and lands is a fool, blind and ignorant. One whose
        heart is mercifully blessed with abiding humility, O Nanak, is
        liberated here, and obtains peace hereafter.  || 1 ||   One who
        becomes wealthy and takes pride in it  -  not even a piece
        of straw shall go along with him. He may place his hopes on a
        large army of men, but he shall vanish in an instant. One who
        deems himself to be the strongest of all, in an instant, shall
        be reduced to ashes. One who thinks of no one else except his
        own prideful self  -  the Righteous Judge of Dharma shall expose
        his disgrace. One who, by Guru's Grace, eliminates his ego,
        O Nanak, becomes acceptable in the Court of the Lord.  || 2 ||
        If someone does millions of good deeds, while acting in ego,
        he shall incur only trouble; all this is in vain. If someone performs
        great penance, while acting in selfishness and conceit, he shall
        be reincarnated into heaven and hell, over and over again. He
        makes all sorts of efforts, but his soul is still not softened
        -  how can he go to the Court of the Lord? One who calls himself
        good  -  goodness shall not draw near him. One whose mind is
        the dust of all  -  says Nanak, his reputation is spotlessly
        pure.  || 3 ||   As long as someone thinks that he is the one
        who acts, he shall have no peace. As long as this mortal thinks
        that he is the one who does things, he shall wander in reincarnation
        through the womb. As long as he considers one an enemy, and another
        a friend, his mind shall not come to rest. As long as he is intoxicated
        with attachment to Maya, the Righteous Judge shall punish him.
        By God's Grace, his bonds are shattered; by Guru's Grace,
        O Nanak, his ego is eliminated.  || 4 || </p>

      <p> Earning a thousand, he runs after a hundred thousand. Satisfaction
        is not obtained by chasing after Maya. He may enjoy all sorts
        of corrupt pleasures, but he is still not satisfied; he indulges
        again and again, wearing himself out, until he dies. Without contentment,
        no one is satisfied. Like the objects in a dream, all his efforts
        are in vain. Through the love of the Naam, all peace is obtained.
        Only a few obtain this, by great good fortune. He Himself is Himself
        the Cause of causes. Forever and ever, O Nanak, chant the Lord's
        Name.  || 5 ||   The Doer, the Cause of causes, is the Creator
        Lord. What deliberations are in the hands of mortal beings? As
        God casts His Glance of Grace, they come to be. God Himself, of
        Himself, is unto Himself. Whatever He created, was by His Own
        Pleasure. He is far from all, and yet with all. He understands,
        He sees, and He passes judgment. He Himself is the One, and He
        Himself is the many. He does not die or perish; He does not come
        or go. O Nanak, He remains forever All-pervading.  || 6 ||   He
        Himself instructs, and He Himself learns. He Himself mingles with
        all. He Himself created His own expanse. All things are His; He
        is the Creator. Without Him, what could be done? In the spaces
        and interspaces, He is the One. In His own play, He Himself is
        the Actor. He produces His plays with infinite variety. He Himself
        is in the mind, and the mind is in Him. O Nanak, His worth cannot
        be estimated.  || 7 ||   True, True, True is God, our Lord and
        Master. By Guru's Grace, some speak of Him. True, True, True
        is the Creator of all. Out of millions, scarcely anyone knows
        Him. Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful is Your Sublime Form. You
        are Exquisitely Beautiful, Infinite and Incomparable. Pure, Pure,
        Pure is the Word of Your Bani, heard in each and every heart,
        spoken to the ears. Holy, Holy, Holy and Sublimely Pure  - 
        chant the Naam, O Nanak, with heart-felt love.  || 8 || 12 ||
        SHALOK:  One who seeks the Sanctuary of the Saints shall be
        saved. One who slanders the Saints, O Nanak, shall be reincarnated
        over and over again.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  Slandering the Saints,
        one's life is cut short. Slandering the Saints, one shall
        not escape the Messenger of Death. Slandering the Saints, all
        happiness vanishes. Slandering the Saints, one falls into hell.
        Slandering the Saints, the intellect is polluted. Slandering the
        Saints, one's reputation is lost. One who is cursed by a
        Saint cannot be saved. Slandering the Saints, one's place
        is defiled. But if the Compassionate Saint shows His Kindness,
        O Nanak, in the Company of the Saints, the slanderer may still
        be saved.  || 1 ||   Slandering the Saints, one becomes a wry-faced
        malcontent. Slandering the Saints, one croaks like a raven. Slandering
        the Saints, one is reincarnated as a snake. Slandering the Saints,
        one is reincarnated as a wiggling worm. Slandering the Saints,
        one burns in the fire of desire. Slandering the Saints, one tries
        to deceive everyone. Slandering the Saints, all one's influence
        vanishes. Slandering the Saints, one becomes the lowest of the
        low. For the slanderer of the Saint, there is no place of rest. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, if it pleases the Saint, even then, he may be saved.
        || 2 ||   The slanderer of the Saint is the worst evil-doer.
        The slanderer of the Saint has not even a moment's rest.
        The slanderer of the Saint is a brutal butcher. The slanderer
        of the Saint is cursed by the Transcendent Lord. The slanderer
        of the Saint has no kingdom. The slanderer of the Saint becomes
        miserable and poor. The slanderer of the Saint contracts all diseases.
        The slanderer of the Saint is forever separated. To slander a
        Saint is the worst sin of sins. O Nanak, if it pleases the Saint,
        then even this one may be liberated.  || 3 ||   The slanderer
        of the Saint is forever impure. The slanderer of the Saint is
        nobody's friend. The slanderer of the Saint shall be punished.
        The slanderer of the Saint is abandoned by all. The slanderer
        of the Saint is totally egocentric. The slanderer of the Saint
        is forever corrupt. The slanderer of the Saint must endure birth
        and death. The slanderer of the Saint is devoid of peace. The
        slanderer of the Saint has no place of rest. O Nanak, if it pleases
        the Saint, then even such a one may merge in union.  || 4 || 
        The slanderer of the Saint breaks down mid-way. The slanderer
        of the Saint cannot accomplish his tasks. The slanderer of the
        Saint wanders in the wilderness. The slanderer of the Saint is
        misled into desolation. The slanderer of the Saint is empty inside,
        like the corpse of a dead man, without the breath of life. The
        slanderer of the Saint has no heritage at all. He himself must
        eat what he has planted. The slanderer of the Saint cannot be
        saved by anyone else. O Nanak, if it pleases the Saint, then even
        he may be saved.  || 5 ||   The slanderer of the Saint bewails
        like this  -  like a fish, out of water, writhing in agony.
        The slanderer of the Saint is hungry and is never satisfied, as
        fire is not satisfied by fuel. The slanderer of the Saint is left
        all alone, like the miserable barren sesame stalk abandoned in
        the field. The slanderer of the Saint is devoid of faith. The
        slanderer of the Saint constantly lies. The fate of the slanderer
        is pre-ordained from the very beginning of time. O Nanak, whatever
        pleases God's Will comes to pass.  || 6 ||   The slanderer
        of the Saint becomes deformed. The slanderer of the Saint receives
        his punishment in the Court of the Lord. The slanderer of the
        Saint is eternally in limbo. He does not die, but he does not
        live either. The hopes of the slanderer of the Saint are not fulfilled.
        The slanderer of the Saint departs disappointed. Slandering the
        Saint, no one attains satisfaction. As it pleases the Lord, so
        do people become; no one can erase their past actions. O Nanak,
        the True Lord alone knows all.  || 7 ||   All hearts are His;
        He is the Creator. Forever and ever, I bow to Him in reverence.
        Praise God, day and night. Meditate on Him with every breath and
        morsel of food. Everything happens as He wills. As He wills, so
        people become. He Himself is the play, and He Himself is the actor.
        Who else can speak or deliberate upon this? </p>

      <p> He Himself gives His Name to those, upon whom He bestows His Mercy.
        Very fortunate, O Nanak, are those people.  || 8 || 13 ||   SHALOK:
        Give up your cleverness, good people  -  remember the Lord
        God, your King! Enshrine in your heart, your hopes in the One
        Lord. O Nanak, your pain, doubt and fear shall depart.  || 1 ||
        ASHTAPADEE:  Reliance on mortals is in vain  -  know this
        well. The Great Giver is the One Lord God. By His gifts, we are
        satisfied, and we suffer from thirst no longer. The One Lord Himself
        destroys and also preserves. Nothing at all is in the hands of
        mortal beings. Understanding His Order, there is peace. So take
        His Name, and wear it as your necklace. Remember, remember, remember
        God in meditation. O Nanak, no obstacle shall stand in your way.
        || 1 ||   Praise the Formless Lord in your mind. O my mind, make
        this your true occupation. Let your tongue become pure, drinking
        in the Ambrosial Nectar. Your soul shall be forever peaceful.
        With your eyes, see the wondrous play of your Lord and Master.
        In the Company of the Holy, all other associations vanish. With
        your feet, walk in the Way of the Lord. Sins are washed away,
        chanting the Lord's Name, even for a moment. So do the Lord's
        Work, and listen to the Lord's Sermon. In the Lord's
        Court, O Nanak, your face shall be radiant.  || 2 ||   Very fortunate
        are those humble beings in this world, who sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, forever and ever. Those who dwell upon the Lord's
        Name, are the most wealthy and prosperous in the world. Those
        who speak of the Supreme Lord in thought, word and deed  - 
        know that they are peaceful and happy, forever and ever. One who
        recognizes the One and only Lord as One, understands this world
        and the next. One whose mind accepts the Company of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, knows the Immaculate Lord.  ||
        3 ||   By Guru's Grace, one understands himself; know that
        then, his thirst is quenched. In the Company of the Holy, one
        chants the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. Such a devotee of the
        Lord is free of all disease. Night and day, sing the Kirtan, the
        Praises of the One Lord. In the midst of your household, remain
        balanced and unattached. One who places his hopes in the One Lord
        -  the noose of Death is cut away from his neck. One whose
        mind hungers for the Supreme Lord God, O Nanak, shall not suffer
        pain.  || 4 ||   One who focuses his conscious mind on the Lord
        God  -  that Saint is at peace; he does not waver. Those unto
        whom God has granted His Grace  -  who do those servants need
        to fear? As God is, so does He appear; in His Own creation, He
        Himself is pervading. Searching, searching, searching, and finally,
        success! By Guru's Grace, the essence of all reality is understood.
        Wherever I look, there I see Him, at the root of all things. O
        Nanak, He is the subtle, and He is also the manifest.  || 5 ||
        Nothing is born, and nothing dies. He Himself stages His own
        drama. Coming and going, seen and unseen, all the world is obedient
        to His Will. </p>

      <p> He Himself is All-in-Himself. In His many ways, He establishes
        and disestablishes. He is Imperishable; nothing can be broken.
        He lends His Support to maintain the Universe. Unfathomable and
        Inscrutable is the Glory of the Lord. As He inspires us to meditate,
        O Nanak, so do we meditate.  || 6 ||   Those who know God are
        glorious. The whole world is redeemed by their teachings. God's
        servants redeem all. God's servants cause sorrows to be forgotten.
        The Merciful Lord unites them with Himself. Chanting the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, they become ecstatic. He alone is committed
        to serve them, upon whom God bestows His Mercy, by great good
        fortune. Those who chant the Naam find their place of rest. O
        Nanak, respect those persons as the most noble.  || 7 ||   Whatever
        you do, do it for the Love of God. Forever and ever, abide with
        the Lord. By its own natural course, whatever will be will be.
        Acknowledge that Creator Lord; God's doings are sweet to
        His humble servant. As He is, so does He appear. From Him we came,
        and into Him we shall merge again. He is the treasure of peace,
        and so does His servant become. Unto His own, He has given His
        honor. O Nanak, know that God and His humble servant are one and
        the same.  || 8 || 14 ||   SHALOK:  God is totally imbued with
        all powers; He is the Knower of our troubles. Meditating in remembrance
        on Him, we are saved; Nanak is a sacrifice to Him.  || 1 ||  
        ASHTAPADEE:  The Lord of the World is the Mender of the broken.
        He Himself cherishes all beings. The cares of all are on His Mind;
        no one is turned away from Him. O my mind, meditate forever on
        the Lord. The Imperishable Lord God is Himself All-in-all. By
        one's own actions, nothing is accomplished, even though the
        mortal may wish it so, hundreds of times. Without Him, nothing
        is of any use to you. Salvation, O Nanak, is attained by chanting
        the Name of the One Lord.  || 1 ||   One who is good-looking should
        not be vain; the Light of God is in all hearts. Why should anyone
        be proud of being rich? All riches are His gifts. One may call
        himself a great hero, but without God's Power, what can anyone
        do? One who brags about giving to charities  -  the Great Giver
        shall judge him to be a fool. One who, by Guru's Grace, is
        cured of the disease of ego  -  O Nanak, that person is forever
        healthy.  || 2 ||   As a palace is supported by its pillars, so
        does the Guru's Word support the mind. As a stone placed
        in a boat can cross over the river, so is the mortal saved, grasping
        hold of the Guru's Feet. As the darkness is illuminated by
        the lamp, so does the mind blossom forth, beholding the Blessed
        Vision of the Guru's Darshan. The path is found through the
        great wilderness by joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, and one's light shines forth. I seek the dust of the
        feet of those Saints; O Lord, fulfill Nanak's longing! || 3 || <br>
