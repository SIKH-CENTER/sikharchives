      <p> Serving the True Guru, I have found the Treasure of Excellence.
        Its value cannot be estimated. The Dear Lord God is my Best Friend.
        In the end, He shall be my Companion and Support.  || 3 ||   In
        this world of my father's home, the Great Giver is the Life
        of the World. The self-willed manmukhs have lost their honor.
        Without the True Guru, no one knows the Way. The blind find no
        place of rest. If the Lord, the Giver of Peace, does not dwell
        within the mind, then they shall depart with regret in the end.
        || 4 ||   In this world of my father's house, through the
        Guru's Teachings, I have cultivated within my mind the Great
        Giver, the Life of the World. Night and day, performing devotional
        worship, day and night, ego and emotional attachment are removed.
        And then, attuned to Him, we become like Him, truly absorbed in
        the True One.  || 5 ||   Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He gives
        us His Love, and we contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        Serving the True Guru, intuitive peace wells up, and ego and desire
        die. The Lord, the Giver of Virtue, dwells forever within the
        minds of those who keep Truth enshrined within their hearts. 
        || 6 ||   My God is forever Immaculate and Pure; with a pure mind,
        He can be found. If the Treasure of the Name of the Lord abides
        within the mind, egotism and pain are totally eliminated. The
        True Guru has instructed me in the Word of the Shabad. I am forever
        a sacrifice to Him.  || 7 ||   Within your own conscious mind,
        you may say anything, but without the Guru, selfishness and conceit
        are not eradicated. The Dear Lord is the Lover of His devotees,
        the Giver of Peace. By His Grace, He abides within the mind. O
        Nanak, God blesses us with the sublime awakening of consciousness;
        He Himself grants glorious greatness to the Gurmukh.  || 8 ||
        1 || 18 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who go around acting
        in egotism are struck down by the Messenger of Death with his
        club. Those who serve the True Guru are uplifted and saved, in
        love with the Lord.  || 1 ||   O mind, become Gurmukh, and meditate
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Those who are so pre-destined
        by the Creator are absorbed into the Naam, through the Guru's
        Teachings.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without the True Guru, faith
        does not come, and love for the Naam is not embraced. Even in
        dreams, they find no peace; they sleep immersed in pain.  || 2
        ||   Even if you chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with great
        longing, your past actions are still not erased. The Lord's
        devotees surrender to His Will; those devotees are accepted at
        His Door.  || 3 ||   The Guru has lovingly implanted the Word
        of His Shabad within me. Without His Grace, it cannot be attained.
        Even if the poisonous plant is watered with ambrosial nectar a
        hundred times, it will still bear poisonous fruit.  || 4 ||  
        Those humble beings who are in love with the True Guru are pure
        and true. They act in harmony with the Will of the True Guru;
        they shed the poison of ego and corruption.  || 5 ||   Acting
        in stubborn-mindedness, no one is saved; go and study the Simritees
        and the Shaastras. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, and practicing the Shabads of the Guru, you shall be saved.
        || 6 ||   The Name of the Lord is the Treasure, which has no
        end or limitation. The Gurmukhs are beauteous; the Creator has
        blessed them with His Mercy.  || 7 ||   O Nanak, the One Lord
        alone is the Giver; there is no other at all. By Guru's Grace,
        He is obtained. </p>

      </p>
      <p> By His Mercy, He is found.  || 8 || 2 || 19 ||   SIREE RAAG, 
        THIRD MEHL:  The soul-bird in the beautiful tree of the body pecks
        at Truth, with love for the Guru. She drinks in the Sublime Essence
        of the Lord, and abides in intuitive ease; she does not fly around
        coming and going. She obtains her home within her own heart; she
        is absorbed into the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   O
        mind, work to serve the Guru. If you walk in harmony with the
        Guru's Will, you shall remain immersed in the Lord's
        Name, night and day.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The birds in the beautiful
        trees fly around in all four directions. The more they fly around,
        the more they suffer; they burn and cry out in pain. Without the
        Guru, they do not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence,
        and they do not obtain the Ambrosial Fruit.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukh
        is like God's tree, always green, blessed with the Sublime
        Love of the True One, with intuitive peace and poise. He cuts
        off the three branches of the three qualities, and embraces love
        for the One Word of the Shabad. The Lord alone is the Ambrosial
        Fruit; He Himself gives it to us to eat.  || 3 ||   The self-willed
        manmukhs stand there and dry up; they do not bear any fruit, and
        they do not provide any shade. Don't even bother to sit near
        them - they have no home or village. They are cut down and
        burnt each day; they have neither the Shabad, nor the Lord's
        Name.  || 4 ||   According to the Lord's Command, people
        perform their actions; they wander around, driven by the karma
        of their past actions. By the Lord's Command, they behold
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Wherever He sends them, there
        they go. By His Command, the Lord, Har, Har, abides within our
        minds; by His Command we merge in Truth.  || 5 ||   The wretched
        fools do not know the Lord's Will; they wander around making
        mistakes. They go about their business stubborn-mindedly; they
        are disgraced forever and ever. Inner peace does not come to them;
        they do not embrace love for the True Lord.  || 6 ||   Beautiful
        are the faces of the Gurmukhs, who bear love and affection for
        the Guru. Through true devotional worship, they are attuned to
        Truth; at the True Door, they are found to be true. Blessed is
        their coming into being; they redeem all their ancestors.  ||
        7 ||   All do their deeds under the Lord's Glance of Grace;
        no one is beyond His Vision. According to the Glance of Grace
        with which the True Lord beholds us, so do we become. O Nanak,
        the Glorious Greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is received
        only by His Mercy.  || 8 || 3 || 20 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:
        The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam; the self-willed manmukhs do
        not understand. The faces of the Gurmukhs are always radiant;
        the Lord has come to dwell within their minds. Through intuitive
        understanding they are at peace, and through intuitive understanding
        they remain absorbed in the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny,
        be the slaves of the Lord's slaves. Service to the Guru is
        worship of the Guru. How rare are those who obtain it!  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The happy soul-bride is always with her Husband Lord,
        if she walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. She attains
        her Eternal, Ever-stable Husband, who never dies or goes away.
        United with the Word of the Shabad, she shall not be separated
        again. She is immersed in the Lap of her Beloved.  || 2 ||   The
        Lord is Immaculate and Radiantly Bright; without the Guru, He
        cannot be found. He cannot be understood by reading scriptures;
        the deceitful pretenders are deluded by doubt. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, the Lord is always found, and the tongue is permeated
        with the Sublime Essence of the Lord.  || 3 || </p>

      <p> Emotional attachment to Maya is shed with intuitive ease, through
        the Guru's Teachings. Without the Shabad, the world wanders
        lost in pain. The self-willed manmukh is consumed. Through the
        Shabad, meditate on the Naam; through the Shabad, you shall merge
        in Truth.  || 4 ||   The Siddhas wander around, deluded by Maya;
        they are not absorbed in the Samaadhi of the Lord's Sublime
        Love. The three worlds are permeated by Maya; they are totally
        covered by it. Without the Guru, liberation is not attained, and
        the double-mindedness of Maya does not go away.  || 5 ||   What
        is called Maya? What does Maya do? These beings are bound by pleasure
        and pain; they do their deeds in egotism. Without the Shabad,
        doubt is not dispelled, and egotism is not eliminated from within.
        || 6 ||   Without love, there is no devotional worship. Without
        the Shabad, no one finds acceptance. Through the Shabad, egotism
        is conquered and subdued, and the illusion of Maya is dispelled.
        The Gurmukh obtains the Treasure of the Naam with intuitive ease.
        || 7 ||   Without the Guru, one's virtues do not shine forth;
        without virtue, there is no devotional worship. The Lord is the
        Lover of His devotees; He abides within their minds. They meet
        that God with intuitive ease. O Nanak, through the Shabad, praise
        the Lord. By His Grace, He is obtained.  || 8 || 4 || 21 ||  
        SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Emotional attachment to Maya is created
        by my God; He Himself misleads us through illusion and doubt.
        The self-willed manmukhs perform their actions, but they do not
        understand; they waste away their lives in vain. Gurbani is the
        Light to illuminate this world; by His Grace, it comes to abide
        within the mind.  || 1 ||   O mind, chant the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, and find peace. Praising the Perfect Guru, you shall
        easily meet with that God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Doubt departs,
        and fear runs away, when you focus your consciousness on the Lord's
        Feet. The Gurmukh practices the Shabad, and the Lord comes to
        dwell within the mind. In the mansion of the home within the self,
        we merge in Truth, and the Messenger of Death cannot devour us.
        || 2 ||   Naam Dayv the printer, and Kabeer the weaver, obtained
        salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize
        His Shabad lose their ego and class consciousness. Their Banis
        are sung by the angelic beings, and no one can erase them, O Siblings
        of Destiny!  || 3 ||   The demon's son Prahlaad had not read
        about religious rituals or ceremonies, austerity or self-discipline;
        he did not know the love of duality. Upon meeting with the True
        Guru, he became pure; night and day, he chanted the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord. He read only of the One and he understood only
        the One Name; he knew no other at all.  || 4 ||   The followers
        of the six different life-styles and world-views, the Yogis and
        the Sanyaasees have gone astray in doubt without the Guru. If
        they serve the True Guru, they find the state of salvation; they
        enshrine the Dear Lord within their minds. They focus their consciousness
        on the True Bani, and their comings and goings in reincarnation
        are over.  || 5 ||   The Pandits, the religious scholars, read
        and argue and stir up controversies, but without the Guru, they
        are deluded by doubt. They wander around the cycle of 8.4 million
        reincarnations; without the Shabad, they do not attain liberation.
        But when they remember the Name, then they attain the state of
        salvation, when the True Guru unites them in Union.  || 6 || </p>

      <p> In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the Name of the Lord
        wells up, when the True Guru unites us in His Sublime Love. I
        offer my mind and body, and I renounce my selfishness and conceit;
        I walk in Harmony with the Will of the True Guru. I am forever
        a sacrifice to my Guru, who has attached my consciousness to the
        Lord.  || 7 ||   He alone is a Brahmin, who knows the Lord Brahma,
        and is attuned to the Love of the Lord. God is close at hand;
        He dwells deep within the hearts of all. How rare are those who,
        as Gurmukh, know Him. O Nanak, through the Naam, greatness is
        obtained; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized.
        || 8 || 5 || 22 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Everyone longs
        to be centered and balanced, but without the Guru, no one can.
        The Pandits and the astrologers read and read until they grow
        weary, while the fanatics are deluded by doubt. Meeting with the
        Guru, intuitive balance is obtained, when God, in His Will, grants
        His Grace.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, without the Guru,
        intuitive balance is not obtained. Through the Word of the Shabad,
        intuitive peace and poise wells up, and that True Lord is obtained.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That which is sung intuitively is acceptable;
        without this intuition, all chanting is useless. In the state
        of intuitive balance, devotion wells up. In intuitive balance,
        love is balanced and detached. In the state of intuitive balance,
        peace and tranquility are produced. Without intuitive balance,
        life is useless.  || 2 ||   In the state of intuitive balance,
        praise the Lord forever and ever. With intuitive ease, embrace
        Samaadhi. In the state of intuitive balance, chant His Glories,
        lovingly absorbed in devotional worship. Through the Shabad, the
        Lord dwells within the mind, and the tongue tastes the Sublime
        Essence of the Lord.  || 3 ||   In the poise of intuitive balance,
        death is destroyed, entering the Sanctuary of the True One. Intuitively
        balanced, the Name of the Lord dwells within the mind, practicing
        the lifestyle of Truth. Those who have found Him are very fortunate;
        they remain intuitively absorbed in Him.  || 4 ||   Within Maya,
        the poise of intuitive balance is not produced. Maya leads to
        the love of duality. The self-willed manmukhs perform religious
        rituals, but they are burnt down by their selfishness and conceit.
        Their births and deaths do not cease; over and over again, they
        come and go in reincarnation.  || 5 ||   In the three qualities,
        intuitive balance is not obtained; the three qualities lead to
        delusion and doubt. What is the point of reading, studying and
        debating, if one loses his roots? In the fourth state, there is
        intuitive balance; the Gurmukhs gather it in.  || 6 ||   The Naam,
        the Name of the Formless Lord, is the treasure. Through intuitive
        balance, understanding is obtained. The virtuous praise the True
        One; their reputation is true. The wayward are united with God
        through intuitive balance; through the Shabad, union is obtained.
        || 7 ||   Without intuitive balance, all are blind. Emotional
        attachment to Maya is utter darkness. In intuitive balance, understanding
        of the True, Infinite Shabad is obtained. Granting forgiveness,
        the Perfect Guru unites us with the Creator.  || 8 ||   In intuitive
        balance, the Unseen is recognized - the Fearless, Luminous,
        Formless Lord. There is only the One Giver of all beings. He blends
        our light with His Light. So praise God through the Perfect Word
        of His Shabad; He has no end or limitation.  || 9 ||   Those who
        are wise take the Naam as their wealth; with intuitive ease, they
        trade with Him. Night and day, they receive the Profit of the
        Lord's Name, which is an inexhaustible and over-flowing treasure. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, when the Great Giver gives, nothing at all is lacking.
        || 10 || 6 || 23 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Meeting with
        the True Guru, you shall not have to go through the cycle of reincarnation
        again; the pains of birth and death will be taken away. Through
        the Perfect Word of the Shabad, all understanding is obtained;
        remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        focus your consciousness on the True Guru. The Immaculate Naam
        itself, ever-fresh, comes to abide within the mind.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   O Dear Lord, please protect and preserve me in Your
        Sanctuary. As You keep me, so do I remain. Through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad, the Gurmukh remains dead while yet alive,
        and swims across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 2 ||   By great
        good fortune, the Name is obtained. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, through the Shabad, you shall be exalted. God, the
        Creator Himself, dwells within the mind; remain absorbed in the
        state of intuitive balance.  || 3 ||   Some are self-willed manmukhs;
        they do not love the Word of the Shabad. Bound in chains, they
        wander lost in reincarnation. Through 8.4 million lifetimes, they
        wander over and over again; they waste away their lives in vain.
        || 4 ||   In the minds of the devotees there is bliss; they are
        attuned to the Love of the True Word of the Shabad. Night and
        day, they constantly sing the Glories of the Immaculate Lord;
        with intuitive ease, they are absorbed into the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 5 ||   The Gurmukhs speak the Ambrosial Bani;
        they recognize the Lord, the Supreme Soul in all. They serve the
        One; they worship and adore the One. The Gurmukhs speak the Unspoken
        Speech.  || 6 ||   The Gurmukhs serve their True Lord and Master,
        who comes to dwell in the mind. They are forever attuned to the
        Love of the True One, who bestows His Mercy and unites them with
        Himself.  || 7 ||   He Himself does, and He Himself causes others
        to do; He wakes some from their sleep. He Himself unites us in
        Union; Nanak is absorbed in the Shabad.  || 8 || 7 || 24 ||  
        SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Serving the True Guru, the mind becomes
        immaculate, and the body becomes pure. The mind obtains bliss
        and eternal peace, meeting with the Deep and Profound Lord. Sitting
        in the Sangat, the True Congregation, the mind is comforted and
        consoled by the True Name.  || 1 ||   O mind, serve the True Guru
        without hesitation. Serving the True Guru, the Lord abides within
        the mind, and no trace of filth shall attach itself to you.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   From the True Word of the Shabad comes honor.
        True is the Name of the True One. I am a sacrifice to those who
        conquer their ego and recognize the Lord. The self-willed manmukhs
        do not know the True One; they find no shelter, and no place of
        rest anywhere.  || 2 ||   Those who take the Truth as their food
        and the Truth as their clothing, have their home in the True One.
        They constantly praise the True One, and in the True Word of the
        Shabad they have their dwelling. They recognize the Lord, the
        Supreme Soul in all, and through the Guru's Teachings they
        dwell in the home of their own inner self.  || 3 ||   They see
        the Truth, and they speak the Truth; their bodies and minds are
        True. True are their teachings, and True are their instructions;
        True are the reputations of the true ones. Those who have forgotten
        the True One are miserable - they depart weeping and wailing.
        || 4 ||   Those who have not served the True Guru - why did
        they even bother to come into the world? They are bound and gagged
        and beaten at Death's door, but no one hears their shrieks
        and cries. </p>

      <p> They waste their lives uselessly; they die and are reincarnated
        over and over again.  || 5 ||   Seeing this world on fire, I rushed
        to the Sanctuary of the True Guru. The True Guru has implanted
        the Truth within me; I dwell steadfastly in Truth and self-restraint.
        The True Guru is the Boat of Truth; in the Word of the Shabad,
        we cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  || 6 ||   People continue
        wandering through the cycle of 8.4 million incarnations; without
        the True Guru, liberation is not obtained. Reading and studying,
        the Pandits and the silent sages have grown weary, but attached
        to the love of duality, they have lost their honor. The True Guru
        teaches the Word of the Shabad; without the True One, there is
        no other at all.  || 7 ||   Those who are linked by the True One
        are linked to Truth. They always act in Truth. They attain their
        dwelling in the home of their own inner being, and they abide
        in the Mansion of Truth. O Nanak, the devotees are happy and peaceful
        forever. They are absorbed in the True Name.  || 8 || 17 || 8
        || 25 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  When you are confronted with
        terrible hardships, and no one offers you any support, when your
        friends turn into enemies, and even your relatives have deserted
        you, and when all support has given way, and all hope has been
        lost - if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, even
        the hot wind shall not touch you.  || 1 ||   Our Lord and Master
        is the Power of the powerless. He does not come or go; He is Eternal
        and Permanent. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He
        is known as True.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If you are weakened by
        the pains of hunger and poverty, with no money in your pockets,
        and no one will give you any comfort, and no one will satisfy
        your hopes and desires, and none of your works is accomplished - if
        you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you shall obtain
        the eternal kingdom.  || 2 ||   When you are plagued by great
        and excessive anxiety, and diseases of the body; when you are
        wrapped up in the attachments of household and family, sometimes
        feeling joy, and then other times sorrow; when you are wandering
        around in all four directions, and you cannot sit or sleep even
        for a moment - if you come to remember the Supreme Lord God,
        then your body and mind shall be cooled and soothed.  || 3 ||
        When you are under the power of sexual desire, anger and worldly
        attachment, or a greedy miser in love with your wealth; if you
        have committed the four great sins and other mistakes; even if
        you are a murderous fiend who has never taken the time to listen
        to sacred books, hymns and poetry - if you then come to remember
        the Supreme Lord God, and contemplate Him, even for a moment,
        you shall be saved.  || 4 ||   People may recite by heart the
        Shaastras, the Simritees and the four Vedas; they may be ascetics,
        great, self-disciplined Yogis; they may visit sacred shrines of
        pilgrimage and perform the six ceremonial rituals, over and over
        again, performing worship services and ritual bathings. Even so,
        if they have not embraced love for the Supreme Lord God, then
        they shall surely go to hell.  || 5 ||   You may possess empires,
        vast estates, authority over others, and the enjoyment of myriads
        of pleasures; you may have delightful and beautiful gardens, and
        issue unquestioned commands; you may have enjoyments and entertainments
        of all sorts and kinds, and continue to enjoy exciting pleasures - and
        yet, if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you
        shall be reincarnated as a snake.  || 6 ||   You may possess vast
        riches, maintain virtuous conduct, have a spotless reputation
        and observe religious customs; you may have the loving affections
        of mother, father, children, siblings and friends; you may have
        armies well-equipped with weapons, and all may salute you with
        respect; </p>

      </p>
      <p> But still, if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God,
        then you shall be taken and consigned to the most hideous hell!
        || 7 ||   You may have a body free of disease and deformity,
        and have no worries or grief at all; you may be unmindful of death,
        and night and day revel in pleasures; you may take everything
        as your own, and have no fear in your mind at all; but still,
        if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you shall
        fall under the power of the Messenger of Death.  || 8 ||   The
        Supreme Lord showers His Mercy, and we find the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. The more time we spend there, the more
        we come to love the Lord. The Lord is the Master of both worlds;
        there is no other place of rest. When the True Guru is pleased
        and satisfied, O Nanak, the True Name is obtained.  || 9 || 1
        || 26 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL,  FIFTH HOUSE:  I do not know
        what pleases my Lord. O mind, seek out the way!  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The meditatives practice meditation, and the wise practice
        spiritual wisdom, but how rare are those who know God!  || 1 ||
        The worshipper of Bhagaauti practices self-discipline, the Yogi
        speaks of liberation, and the ascetic is absorbed in asceticism.
        || 2 ||   The men of silence observe silence, the Sanyaasees
        observe celibacy, and the Udaasees abide in detachment.  || 3
        ||   There are nine forms of devotional worship. The Pandits recite
        the Vedas. The householders assert their faith in family life.
        || 4 ||   Those who utter only One Word, those who take many
        forms, the naked renunciates, the wearers of patched coats, the
        magicians, those who remain always awake, and those who bathe
        at holy places of pilgrimage -   || 5 ||   Those who go without
        food, those who never touch others, the hermits who never show
        themselves, and those who are wise in their own minds -   ||
        6 ||   Of these, no one admits to any deficiency; all say that
        they have found the Lord. But he alone is a devotee, whom the
        Lord has united with Himself.  || 7 ||   Abandoning all devices
        and contrivances, I have sought His Sanctuary. Nanak has fallen
        at the Feet of the Guru.  || 8 || 2 || 27 || </p>

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,  THIRD HOUSE: </p>
      </center>
      <p> Among Yogis, You are the Yogi; among pleasure seekers, You are
        the Pleasure Seeker. Your limits are not known to any of the beings
        in the heavens, in this world, or in the nether regions of the
        underworld.  || 1 ||   I am devoted, dedicated, a sacrifice to
        Your Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You created the world, and assigned
        tasks to one and all. You watch over Your Creation, and through
        Your All-powerful Creative Potency, You cast the dice.  || 2 ||
        You are manifest in the Expanse of Your Workshop. Everyone longs
        for Your Name, but without the Guru, no one finds You. All are
        enticed and trapped by Maya.  || 3 ||   I am a sacrifice to the
        True Guru. Meeting Him, the supreme status is obtained. </p>

      <p> The angelic beings and the silent sages long for Him; the True
        Guru has given me this understanding.  || 4 ||   How is the Society
        of the Saints to be known? There, the Name of the One Lord is
        chanted. The One Name is the Lord's Command; O Nanak, the
        True Guru has given me this understanding.  || 5 ||   This world
        has been deluded by doubt. You Yourself, Lord, have led it astray.
        The discarded soul-brides suffer in terrible agony; they have
        no luck at all.  || 6 ||   What are the signs of the discarded
        brides? They miss their Husband Lord, and they wander around in
        dishonor. The clothes of those brides are filthy - they pass
        their life-night in agony.  || 7 ||   What actions have the happy
        soul-brides performed? They have obtained the fruit of their pre-ordained
        destiny. Casting His Glance of Grace, the Lord unites them with
        Himself.  || 8 ||   Those, whom God causes to abide by His Will,
        have the Shabad of His Word abiding deep within. They are the
        true soul-brides, who embrace love for their Husband Lord.  ||
        9 ||   Those who take pleasure in God's Will remove doubt
        from within. O Nanak, know Him as the True Guru, who unites all
        with the Lord.  || 10 ||   Meeting with the True Guru, they receive
        the fruits of their destiny, and egotism is driven out from within.
        The pain of evil-mindedness is eliminated; good fortune comes
        and shines radiantly from their foreheads.  || 11 ||   The Bani
        of Your Word is Ambrosial Nectar. It permeates the hearts of Your
        devotees. Serving You, peace is obtained; granting Your Mercy,
        You bestow salvation.  || 12 ||   Meeting with the True Guru,
        one comes to know; by this meeting, one comes to chant the Name.
        Without the True Guru, God is not found; all have grown weary
        of performing religious rituals.  || 13 ||   I am a sacrifice
        to the True Guru; I was wandering in doubt, and He has set me
        on the right path. If the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, He unites
        us with Himself.  || 14 ||   You, Lord, are pervading in all,
        and yet, the Creator keeps Himself concealed. O Nanak, the Creator
        is revealed to the Gurmukh, within whom He has infused His Light.
        || 15 ||   The Master Himself bestows honor. He creates and bestows
        body and soul. He Himself preserves the honor of His servants;
        He places both His Hands upon their foreheads.  || 16 ||   All
        strict rituals are just clever contrivances. My God knows everything.
        He has made His Glory manifest, and all people celebrate Him.
        || 17 ||   He has not considered my merits and demerits; this
        is God's Own Nature. Hugging me close in His Embrace, He
        protects me, and now, even the hot wind does not touch me.  ||
        18 ||   Within my mind and body, I meditate on God. I have obtained
        the fruits of my soul's desire. You are the Supreme Lord
        and Master, above the heads of kings. </p>

      <p> Nanak lives by chanting Your Name.  || 19 ||   You Yourself created
        the Universe; You created the play of duality, and staged it.
        The Truest of the True is pervading everywhere; He instructs those
        with whom He is pleased.  || 20 ||   By Guru's Grace, I have
        found God. By His Grace, I have shed emotional attachment to Maya.
        Showering His Mercy, He has blended me into Himself.  || 21 ||
        You are the Gopis, the milk-maids of Krishna; You are the sacred
        river Jamunaa; You are Krishna, the herdsman. You Yourself support
        the world. By Your Command, human beings are fashioned. You Yourself
        embellish them, and then again destroy them.  || 22 ||   Those
        who have focused their consciousness on the True Guru have rid
        themselves of the love of duality. The light of those mortal beings
        is immaculate. They depart after redeeming their lives.  || 23
        ||   Forever and ever, night and day, I praise the Greatness of
        Your Goodness. You bestow Your Gifts, even if we do not ask for
        them. Says Nanak, contemplate the True Lord.  || 24 || 1 ||  
        SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  I fall at His Feet to please and appease
        Him. The True Guru has united me with the Lord, the Primal Being.
        There is no other as great as He.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord
        of the Universe is my Sweet Beloved. He is sweeter than my mother
        or father. Among all sisters and brothers and friends, there is
        no one like You.  || 1 ||   By Your Command, the month of Saawan
        has come. I have hooked up the plow of Truth, and I plant the
        seed of the Name in hopes that the Lord, in His Generosity, will
        bestow a bountiful harvest.  || 2 ||   Meeting with the Guru,
        I recognize only the One Lord. In my consciousness, I do not know
        of any other account. The Lord has assigned one task to me; as
        it pleases Him, I perform it.  || 3 ||   Enjoy yourselves and
        eat, O Siblings of Destiny. In the Guru's Court, He has blessed
        me with the Robe of Honor. I have become the Master of my body-village;
        I have taken the five rivals as prisoners.  || 4 ||   I have come
        to Your Sanctuary. The five farm-hands have become my tenants;
        none dare to raise their heads against me. O Nanak, my village
        is populous and prosperous.  || 5 ||   I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice
        to You. I meditate on You continually. The village was in ruins,
        but You have re-populated it. I am a sacrifice to You.  || 6 ||
        O Beloved Lord, I meditate on You continually; I obtain the
        fruits of my mind's desires. All my affairs are arranged,
        and the hunger of my mind is appeased.  || 7 ||   I have forsaken
        all my entanglements; I serve the True Lord of the Universe. I
        have firmly attached the Name, the Home of the Nine Treasures
        to my robe.  || 8 ||   I have obtained the comfort of comforts.
        The Guru has implanted the Word of the Shabad deep within me.
        The True Guru has shown me my Husband Lord; He has placed His
        Hand upon my forehead.  || 9 ||   I have established the Temple
        of Truth. I sought out the Guru's Sikhs, and brought them
        into it. I wash their feet, and wave the fan over them. </p>

      <p> Bowing low, I fall at their feet.  || 10 ||   I heard of the Guru,
        and so I went to Him. He instilled within me the Naam, the goodness
        of charity and true cleansing. All the world is liberated, O Nanak,
        by embarking upon the Boat of Truth.  || 11 ||   The whole Universe
        serves You, day and night. Please hear my prayer, O Dear Lord.
        I have thoroughly tested and seen all - You alone, by Your
        Pleasure, can save us.  || 12 ||   Now, the Merciful Lord has
        issued His Command. Let no one chase after and attack anyone else.
        Let all abide in peace, under this Benevolent Rule.  || 13 ||
        Softly and gently, drop by drop, the Ambrosial Nectar trickles
        down. I speak as my Lord and Master causes me to speak. I place
        all my faith in You; please accept me.  || 14 ||   Your devotees
        are forever hungry for You. O Lord, please fulfill my desires.
        Grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Giver of Peace.
        Please, take me into Your Embrace.  || 15 ||   I have not found
        any other as Great as You. You pervade the continents, the worlds
        and the nether regions; You are permeating all places and interspaces.
        Nanak: You are the True Support of Your devotees.  || 16 ||  
        I am a wrestler; I belong to the Lord of the World. I met with
        the Guru, and I have tied a tall, plumed turban. All have gathered
        to watch the wrestling match, and the Merciful Lord Himself is
        seated to behold it.  || 17 ||   The bugles play and the drums
        beat. The wrestlers enter the arena and circle around. I have
        thrown the five challengers to the ground, and the Guru has patted
        me on the back.  || 18 ||   All have gathered together, but we
        shall return home by different routes. The Gurmukhs reap their
        profits and leave, while the self-willed manmukhs lose their investment
        and depart.  || 19 ||   You are without color or mark. The Lord
        is seen to be manifest and present. Hearing of Your Glories again
        and again, Your devotees meditate on You; they are attuned to
        You, O Lord, Treasure of Excellence.  || 20 ||   Through age after
        age, I am the servant of the Merciful Lord. The Guru has cut away
        my bonds. I shall not have to dance in the wrestling arena of
        life again. Nanak has searched, and found this opportunity.  ||

      <p> In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you were
        cast into the womb, by the Lord's Command. Upside-down, within
        the womb, you performed penance, O my merchant friend, and you
        prayed to your Lord and Master. You uttered prayers to your Lord
        and Master, while upside-down, and you meditated on Him with deep
        love and affection. You came into this Dark Age of Kali Yuga naked,
