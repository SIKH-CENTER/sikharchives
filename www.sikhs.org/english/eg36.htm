      <p> He does not die, so I do not fear. He does not perish, so I do
        not grieve. He is not poor, so I do not hunger. He is not in pain,
        so I do not suffer.  || 1 ||   There is no other Destroyer than
        Him. He is my very life, the Giver of life.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        He is not bound, so I am not in bondage. He has no occupation,
        so I have no entanglements. He has no impurities, so I have no
        impurities. He is in ecstasy, so I am always happy.  || 2 || 
        He has no anxiety, so I have no cares. He has no stain, so I
        have no pollution. He has no hunger, so I have no thirst. Since
        He is immaculately pure, I correspond to Him.  || 3 ||   I am
        nothing; He is the One and only. Before and after, He alone exists.
        O Nanak, the Guru has taken away my doubts and mistakes; He and
        I, joining together, are of the same color.  || 4 || 32 || 83
        ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Serve Him in many different ways; Dedicate
        your soul, your breath of life and your wealth to Him. Carry water
        for Him, and wave the fan over Him  -  renounce your ego. Make
        yourself a sacrifice to Him, time and time again.  || 1 ||   She
        alone is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to God. In her
        company, I may meet Him, O my mother.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I
        am the water-carrier of the slaves of His slaves. I treasure in
        my soul the dust of their feet. By that good destiny inscribed
        upon my forehead, I obtain their society. Through His Love, the
        Lord Master meets me.  || 2 ||   I dedicate all to Him  - 
        chanting and meditation, austerity and religious observances.
        I offer all to Him  -  good actions, righteous conduct and
        incense burning. Renouncing pride and attachment, I become the
        dust of the feet of the Saints. In their society, I behold God
        with my eyes.  || 3 ||   Each and every moment, I contemplate
        and adore Him. Day and night, I serve Him like this. The Lord
        of the Universe, the Cherisher of the World, has become merciful;
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, He forgives
        us.  || 4 || 33 || 84 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the Love of
        God, eternal peace is obtained. In the Love of God, one is not
        touched by pain. In the Love of God, the filth of ego is washed
        away. In the Love of God, one becomes forever immaculate.  ||
        1 ||   Listen, O friend: show such love and affection to God,
        the Support of the soul, the breath of life, of each and every
        heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Love of God, all treasures
        are obtained. In the Love of God, the Immaculate Naam fills the
        heart. In the Love of God, one is eternally embellished. In the
        Love of God, all anxiety is ended.  || 2 ||   In the Love of God,
        one crosses over this terrible world-ocean. In the Love of God,
        one does not fear death. In the Love of God, all are saved. The
        Love of God shall go along with you.  || 3 ||   By himself, no
        one is united, and no one goes astray. One who is blessed by God's
        Mercy, joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Says Nanak,
        I am a sacrifice to You. O God, You are the Support and the Strength
        of the Saints.  || 4 || 34 || 85 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Becoming
        a king, the mortal wields his royal authority; oppressing the
        people, he gathers wealth. </p>
      <p>

      <p> Gathering it and collecting it, he fills his bags. But God takes
        it away from him, and gives it to another.  || 1 ||   The mortal
        is like an unbaked clay pot in water; indulging in pride and egotism,
        he crumbles down and dissolves.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Being fearless,
        he becomes unrestrained. He does not think of the Creator, who
        is ever with him. He raises armies, and collects arms. But when
        the breath leaves him, he turns to ashes.  || 2 ||   He has lofty
        palaces, mansions and queens, elephants and pairs of horses, delighting
        the mind; he is blessed with a great family of sons and daughters.
        But, engrossed in attachment, the blind fool wastes away to death.
        || 3 ||   The One who created him destroys him. Enjoyments and
        pleasures are like just a dream. He alone is liberated, and possesses
        regal power and wealth, O Nanak, whom the Lord Master blesses
        with His Mercy.  || 4 || 35 || 86 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        mortal is in love with this, but the more he has, the more he
        longs for more. It hangs around his neck, and does not leave him.
        But falling at the feet of the True Guru, he is saved.  || 1 ||
        I have renounced and discarded Maya, the Enticer of the world.
        I have met the Absolute Lord, and congratulations are pouring
        in.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   She is so beautiful, she captivates
        the mind. On the road, and the beach, at home, in the forest and
        in the wilderness, she touches us. She seems so sweet to the mind
        and body. But by Guru's Grace, I have seen her to be deceptive.
        || 2 ||   Her courtiers are also great deceivers. They do not
        spare even their fathers or mothers. They have enslaved their
        companions. By Guru's Grace, I have subjugated them all.
        || 3 ||   Now, my mind is filled with bliss; my fear is gone,
        and the noose is cut away. Says Nanak, when I met the True Guru,
        I came to dwell within my home in absolute peace.  || 4 || 36
        || 87 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Twenty-four hours a day, he knows
        the Lord to be near at hand; he surrenders to the Sweet Will of
        God. The One Name is the Support of the Saints; they remain the
        dust of the feet of all.  || 1 ||   Listen, to the way of life
        of the Saints, O my Siblings of Destiny; their praises cannot
        be described.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Their occupation is the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. The Kirtan, the Praise of the Lord, the
        embodiment of bliss, is their rest. Friends and enemies are one
        and the same to them. They know of no other than God.  || 2 ||
        They erase millions upon millions of sins. They dispel suffering;
        they are givers of the life of the soul. They are so brave; they
        are men of their word. The Saints have enticed Maya herself. 
        || 3 ||   Their company is cherished even by the gods and the
        angels. Blessed is their Darshan, and fruitful is their service.
        With his palms pressed together, Nanak offers his prayer: O Lord,
        Treasure of Excellence, please bless me with the service of the
        Saints.  || 4 || 37 || 88 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  All peace
        and comforts are in the meditation of the One Name. All righteous
        actions of Dharma are in the singing of the Lord's Glorious
        Praises. </p>

      <p> The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is so very pure and
        sacred. Meeting with them, love for God is embraced.  || 1 ||
        By Guru's Grace, bliss is obtained. Meditating upon Him
        in remembrance, the mind is illumined; his state and condition
        cannot be described.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Fasts, religious vows,
        cleansing baths, and worship to Him; listening to the Vedas, Puraanas,
        and Shaastras. Extremely pure is he, and immaculate is his place,
        who meditates upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh
        Sangat.  || 2 ||   That humble being becomes renowned all over
        the world. Even sinners are purified, by the dust of his feet.
        One who has met the Lord, the Lord our King, his condition and
        state cannot be described.  || 3 ||   Twenty-four hours a day,
        with palms pressed together, I meditate; I yearn to obtain the
        Blessed Vision of the Darshan of those Holy Saints. Merge me,
        the poor one, with You, O Lord; Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary.
        || 4 || 38 || 89 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Twenty-four hours
        a day, he takes his cleansing bath in water; he makes continual
        offerings to the Lord; he is a true man of wisdom. He never leaves
        anything uselessly. Again and again, he falls at the Lord's
        Feet.  || 1 ||   Such is the Saalagraam, the stone idol, which
        I serve; such is my worship, flower-offerings and divine adoration
        as well.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   His bell resounds to the four corners
        of the world. His seat is forever in heaven. His chauri, his fly-brush,
        waves over all. His incense is ever-fragrant.  || 2 ||   He is
        treasured in each and every heart. The Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, is His Eternal Court. His Aartee, his lamp-lit worship
        service, is the Kirtan of His Praises, which brings lasting bliss.
        His Greatness is so beautiful, and ever limitless.  || 3 ||  
        He alone obtains it, who is so pre-ordained; he takes to the Sanctuary
        of the Saints' Feet. I hold in my hands the Saalagraam of
        the Lord. Says Nanak, the Guru has given me this Gift.  || 4 ||
        39 || 90 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  PANCH-PADAS:  That highway,
        upon which the water-carrier is plundered  -  that way is far
        removed from the Saints.  || 1 ||   The True Guru has spoken the
        Truth. Your Name, O Lord, is the Way to Salvation; the road of
        the Messenger of Death is far away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That
        place, where the greedy toll-collector dwells  -  that path
        remains far removed from the Lord's humble servant.  || 2
        ||   There, where so very many caravans of men are caught, the
        Holy Saints remain with the Supreme Lord.  || 3 ||   Chitra and
        Gupat, the recording angels of the conscious and the unconscious,
        write the accounts of all mortal beings, but they cannot even
        see the Lord's humble devotees.  || 4 ||   Says Nanak, one
        whose True Guru is Perfect  -  the unblown bugles of ecstasy
        vibrate for him.  || 5 || 40 || 91 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  DU-PADAS
        1:  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Naam is
        learned; all desires and tasks are fulfilled. My thirst has been
        quenched, and I am satiated with the Lord's Praise. I live
        by chanting and meditating upon the Lord, the Sustainer of the
        earth.  || 1 ||   I have entered the Sanctuary of the Creator,
        the Cause of all causes. By Guru's Grace, I have entered
        the home of celestial bliss. Darkness is dispelled, and the moon
        of wisdom has risen.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> My treasure-house is overflowing with rubies and jewels; I meditate
        on the Formless Lord, and so they never run short. How rare is
        that humble being, who drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Word
        of the Shabad. O Nanak, he attains the state of highest dignity.
        || 2 || 41 || 92 ||   AASAA,  SEVENTH HOUSE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate
        continually on the Name of the Lord within your heart. Thus you
        shall save all your companions and associates.  || 1 ||   My Guru
        is always with me, near at hand. Meditating, meditating in remembrance
        on Him, I cherish Him forever.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your actions
        seem so sweet to me. Nanak begs for the treasure of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 2 || 42 || 93 ||  AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The world is saved by the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
        The Name of the Lord is the Support of the mind.  || 1 ||   The
        Saints worship and adore the Lotus Feet of the Divine Guru; they
        love the Beloved Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   She who has such
        good destiny written upon her forehead, says Nanak, is blessed
        with the eternal happy marriage with the Lord.  || 2 || 43 ||
        94 ||  AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Order of my Husband Lord seems
        so sweet to me. My Husband Lord has driven out the one who was
        my rival. My Beloved Husband has decorated me, His happy soul-bride.
        He has quieted the burning thirst of my mind.  || 1 ||   It is
        good that I submitted to the Will of my Beloved Lord. I have realized
        celestial peace and poise within this home of mine.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   I am the hand-maiden, the attendant of my Beloved
        Lord. He is eternal and imperishable, inaccessible and infinite.
        Holding the fan, sitting at His Feet, I wave it over my Beloved.
        The five demons who tortured me have run away.  || 2 ||   I am
        not from a noble family, and I am not beautiful. What do I know?
        Why am I pleasing to my Beloved? I am a poor orphan, destitute
        and dishonored. My Husband took me in, and made me His queen.
        || 3 ||   When I saw my Beloved's face before me, I became
        so happy and peaceful; my married life was blessed. Says Nanak,
        my desires are fulfilled. The True Guru has united me with God,
        the treasure of excellence.  || 4 || 1 || 95 ||  AASAA,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  A frown creases her forehead, and her look is evil. Her
        speech is bitter, and her tongue is rude. She is always hungry,
        and she believes her Husband to be far away.  || 1 ||   Such is
        Maya, the woman, which the One Lord has created. She is devouring
        the whole world, but the Guru has saved me, O my Siblings of Destiny.
        ||  Pause  ||   Administering her poisons, she has overcome the
        whole world. She has bewitched Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Only
        those Gurmukhs who are attuned to the Naam are blessed.  || 2
        ||   Performing fasts, religious observances and atonements, the
        mortals have grown weary. They wander over the entire planet,
        on pilgrimages to the banks of sacred rivers. But they alone are
        saved, who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru.  || 3 ||   Attached
        to Maya, the whole world is in bondage. The foolish self-willed
        manmukhs are consumed by their egotism. Taking me by the arm,
        Guru Nanak has saved me.  || 4 || 2 || 96 ||  AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Everything is painful, when one forgets the Lord Master. Here
        and hereafter, such a mortal is useless.  || 1 ||   The Saints
        are satisfied, meditating on the Lord, Har, Har. </p>

      <p> Bestowing Your Mercy, God, You attach us to Your Name; all peace
        comes by Your Will.  ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is Ever-present;
        one who deems Him to be far away, dies again and again, repenting.
        || 2 ||   The mortals do not remember the One, who has given
        them everything. Engrossed in such terrible corruption, their
        days and nights waste away.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, meditate in
        remembrance of the One Lord God. Salvation is obtained, in the
        Shelter of the Perfect Guru.  || 4 || 3 || 97 ||  AASAA,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind
        and body are totally rejuvenated. All sins and sorrows are washed
        away.  || 1 ||   How blessed is that day, O my Siblings of Destiny,
        when the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung, and the supreme
        status is obtained.  ||  Pause  ||   Worshipping the feet of the
        Holy Saints, troubles and hatred are eliminated from the mind.
        || 2 ||   Meeting with the Perfect Guru, conflict is ended, and
        the five demons are totally subdued.  || 3 ||   One whose mind
        is filled with the Name of the Lord, O Nanak  -  I am a sacrifice
        to him.  || 4 || 4 || 98 ||  AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  O singer, sing
        of the One, who is the Support of the soul, the body and the breath
        of life. Serving Him, all peace is obtained. You shall no longer
        go to any other.  || 1 ||   My Blissful Lord Master is forever
        in bliss; meditate continually and forever, on the Lord, the treasure
        of excellence. I am a sacrifice to the Beloved Saints; by their
        kind favor, God comes to dwell in the mind.  ||  Pause  ||   His
        gifts are never exhausted. In His subtle way, He easily absorbs
        all. His benevolence cannot be erased. So enshrine that True Lord
        within your mind.  || 2 ||   His house is filled with all sorts
        of articles; God's servants never suffer pain. Holding to
        His Support, the state of fearless dignity is obtained. With each
        and every breath, sing of the Lord, the treasure of excellence.
        || 3 ||   He is not far from us, wherever we go. When He shows
        His Mercy, we obtain the Lord, Har, Har. I offer this prayer to
        the Perfect Guru. Nanak begs for the treasure of the Lord's
        Name.  || 4 || 5 || 99 ||  AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  First, the pains
        of the body vanish; then, the mind becomes totally peaceful. In
        His Mercy, the Guru bestows the Lord's Name. I am a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice to that True Guru.  || 1 ||   I have obtained the
        Perfect Guru, O my Siblings of Destiny. All illness, sorrows and
        sufferings are dispelled, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru. 
        ||  Pause  ||   The feet of the Guru abide within my heart; I
        have received all the fruits of my heart's desires. The fire
        is extinguished, and I am totally peaceful. Showering His Mercy,
        the Guru has given this gift.  || 2 ||   The Guru has given shelter
        to the shelterless. The Guru has given honor to the dishonored.
        Shattering his bonds, the Guru has saved His servant. I taste
        with my tongue the Ambrosial Bani of His Word.  || 3 ||   By great
        good fortune, I worship the Guru's feet. Forsaking everything,
        I have obtained God's Sanctuary. </p>

      <p> That humble being, O Nanak, unto whom the Guru grants His Mercy,
        is forever enraptured.  || 4 || 6 || 100 ||  AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The True Guru has truly given a child. The long-lived one has
        been born to this destiny. He came to acquire a home in the womb,
        and his mother's heart is so very glad.  || 1 ||   A son
        is born  -  a devotee of the Lord of the Universe. This pre-ordained
        destiny has been revealed to all.  ||  Pause  ||   In the tenth
        month, by the Lord's Order, the baby has been born. Sorrow
        is dispelled, and great joy has ensued. The companions blissfully
        sing the songs of the Guru's Bani. This is pleasing to the
        Lord Master.  || 2 ||   The vine has grown, and shall last for
        many generations. The Power of the Dharma has been firmly established
        by the Lord. That which my mind wishes for, the True Guru has
        granted. I have become carefree, and I fix my attention on the
        One Lord.  || 3 ||   As the child places so much faith in his
        father, I speak as it pleases the Guru to have me speak. This
        is not a hidden secret; Guru Nanak, greatly pleased, has bestowed
        this gift.  || 4 || 7 || 101 ||  AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Giving His
        Hand, the Perfect Guru has protected the child. The glory of His
        servant has become manifest.  || 1 ||   I contemplate the Guru,
        the Guru; I meditate on the Guru, the Guru. I offer my heart-felt
        prayer to the Guru, and it is answered.  ||  Pause  ||   I have
        taken to the Sanctuary of the True Divine Guru. The service of
        His servant has been fulfilled.  || 2 ||   He has preserved my
        soul, body, youth and breath of life. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice
        to the Guru.  || 3 || 8 || 102 || </p>

        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> I am Your purchased slave, O True Lord Master. My soul and body,
        and all of this, everything is Yours.  || 1 ||   You are the honor
        of the dishonored. O Master, in You I place my trust. Without
        the True One, any other support is false  -  know this well.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your Command is infinite; no one can find
        its limit. One who meets with the Perfect Guru, walks in the Way
        of the Lord's Will.  || 2 ||   Cunning and cleverness are
        of no use. That which the Lord Master gives, by the Pleasure of
        His Will  -  that is pleasing to me.  || 3 ||   One may perform
        tens of thousands of actions, but attachment to things is not
        satisfied. Servant Nanak has made the Naam his Support. He has
        renounced other entanglements.  || 4 || 1 || 103 ||   AASAA, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  I have pursued all pleasures, but none is as great
        as the Lord. By the Pleasure of the Guru's Will, the True
        Lord Master is obtained.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to my Guru;
        I am forever and ever a sacrifice to Him. Please, grant me this
        one blessing, that I may never, even for an instant, forget Your
        Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   How very fortunate are those who have
        the wealth of the Lord deep within the heart. </p>

      <p> They escape from the great noose of death; they are permeated
        with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 2 ||   How can I
        chant the Glorious Praises of the Guru? The Guru is the ocean
        of Truth and clear understanding. He is the Perfect Transcendent
        Lord, from the very beginning, and throughout the ages.  || 3
        ||   Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, forever and
        ever, my mind is filled with the Love of the Lord, Har, Har. The
        Guru is my soul, my breath of life, and wealth; O Nanak, He is
        with me forever.  || 4 || 2 || 104 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  If
        the Invisible and Infinite Lord dwells within my mind, even for
        a moment, then all my pains, troubles, and diseases vanish.  ||
        1 ||   I am a sacrifice to my Lord Master. Meditating on Him,
        a great joy wells up within my mind and body.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I have heard only a little bit of news about the True Lord
        Master. I have obtained the peace of all peace, O my mother; I
        cannot estimate its worth.  || 2 ||   He is so beautiful to my
        eyes; beholding Him, I have been bewitched. I am worthless, O
        my mother; He Himself has attached me to the hem of His robe.
        || 3 ||   He is beyond the world of the Vedas, the Koran and
        the Bible. The Supreme King of Nanak is immanent and manifest.
        || 4 || 3 || 105 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Tens of thousands
        of devotees worship and adore You, chanting, &quot;Beloved, Beloved.&quot;
        How shall You unite me, the worthless and corrupt soul, with
        Yourself.  || 1 ||   You are my Support, O Merciful God, Lord
        of the Universe, Sustainer of the World. You are the Master of
        all; the entire creation is Yours.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are
        the constant help and support of the Saints, who behold You Ever-present.
        Those who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, shall die, engulfed
        in sorrow and pain.  || 2 ||   Those servants, who lovingly perform
        the Lord's service, are freed from the cycle of reincarnation.
        What shall be the fate of those who forget the Naam?  || 3 ||
        As are the cattle which have strayed, so is the entire world.
        O God, please cut away Nanak's bonds, and unite him with
        Yourself.  || 4 || 4 || 106 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Forget all
        other things, and dwell upon the Lord alone. Lay aside your false
        pride, and dedicate your mind and body to Him.  || 1 ||   Twenty-four
        hours a day, praise the Creator Lord. I live by Your bountiful
        gifts  -  please, shower me with Your Mercy!  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   So, do that work, by which your face shall be made radiant.
        He alone becomes attached to the Truth, O Lord, unto whom You
        give it.  || 2 ||   So build and adorn that house, which shall
        never be destroyed. Enshrine the One Lord within your consciousness;
        He shall never die.  || 3 ||   The Lord is dear to those, who
        are pleasing to the Will of God. By Guru's Grace, Nanak describes
        the indescribable.  || 4 || 5 || 107 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        What are they like  -  those who do not forget the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord? Know that there is absolutely no difference;
        they are exactly like the Lord.  || 1 ||   The mind and body are
        enraptured, meeting with You, O Lord. Peace is obtained, by the
        favor of the Lord's humble servant; all pains are taken away.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As many as are the continents of the world,
        so many have been saved. Those, in whose minds You Yourself dwell,

        person is known everywhere.  || 3 ||   Day and night, to worship
        and adore the Lord, the King  -  please, O True Supreme King,
        fulfill this, Nanak's desire.  || 4 || 6 || 108 ||   AASAA,
        FIFTH MEHL:  He, my Lord Master, is fully pervading all places.
        He is the One Lord Master, the roof over our heads; there is no
        other than Him.  || 1 ||   As it pleases Your Will, please save
        me, O Savior Lord. Without You, my eyes see no other at all. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God Himself is the Cherisher; He takes care
        of each and every heart. That person, within whose mind You Yourself
        dwell, never forgets You.  || 2 ||   He does that which is pleasing
        to Himself. He is known as the help and support of His devotees,
        throughout the ages.  || 3 ||   Chanting and meditating up the
        Lord's Name, the mortal never comes to regret anything. O
        Nanak, I thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; please,
        fulfill my desire, O Lord.  || 4 || 7 || 109 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Why are you sleeping, and forgetting the Name, O careless
        and foolish mortal? So many have been washed away and carried
        off by this river of life.  || 1 ||   O mortal, get aboard the
        boat of the Lord's Lotus Feet, and cross over. Twenty-four
        hours a day, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You may
        enjoy various pleasures, but they are useless without the Name.
        Without devotion to the Lord, you shall die in sorrow, again and
        again.  || 2 ||   You may dress and eat and apply scented oils
        to your body, but without the meditative remembrance of the Lord,
        your body shall surely turn to dust, and you shall have to depart.
        || 3 ||   How very treacherous is this world-ocean; how very
        few realize this! Salvation rests in the Lord's Sanctuary;
        O Nanak, this is your pre-ordained destiny.  || 4 || 8 || 110
        ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  No one is anyone's companion; why
        take any pride in others? With the Support of the One Name, this
        terrible world-ocean is crossed over.  || 1 ||   You are the True
        Support of me, the poor mortal, O my Perfect True Guru. Gazing
        upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, my mind is encouraged.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Royal powers, wealth, and worldly involvements
        are of no use at all. The Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is
        my Support; this wealth is everlasting.  || 2 ||   As many as
        are the pleasures of Maya, so many are the shadows they leave.
        The Gurmukhs sing of the Naam, the treasure of peace.  || 3 ||
        You are the True Lord, the treasure of excellence; O God, You
        are deep and unfathomable. The Lord Master is the hope and support
        of Nanak's mind.  || 4 || 9 || 111 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Remembering Him, suffering is removed, and celestial peace is
        obtained. Night and day, with your palms pressed together, meditate
        on the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   He alone is Nanak's God,
        unto whom all beings belong. He is totally pervading everywhere,
        the Truest of the True.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Inwardly and outwardly,
        He is my companion and my helper; He is the One to be realized.
        Adoring Him, my mind is cured of all its ailments.  || 2 ||

        it in meditation, the inner fire is quenched.  || 3 ||   Peace,
        poise, and immense bliss, O Nanak, are obtained, when one becomes
        the dust of the feet of the humble servants of the Lord. All of
        one's affairs are perfectly resolved, meeting with the Perfect
        Guru.  || 4 || 10 || 112 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord of
        the Universe is the treasure of excellence; He is known only to
        the Gurmukh. When He shows His Mercy and Kindness, we revel in
        the Lord's Love.  || 1 ||   Come, O Saints  -  let us
        join together and speak the Sermon of the Lord. Night and day,
        meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and ignore the criticism
        of others.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I live by chanting and meditating
        on the Naam, and so I obtain immense bliss. Attachment to the
        world is useless and vain; it is false, and perishes in the end.
        || 2 ||   How rare are those who embrace love for the Lord's
        Lotus Feet. Blessed and beautiful is that mouth, which meditates
        on the Lord.  || 3 ||   The pains of birth, death and reincarnation
        are erased by meditating on the Lord. That alone is Nanak's
        joy, which is pleasing to God.  || 4 || 11 || 113 ||   AASAA,

        all the tastes and flavors. Let us join together and chant the
        Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and so wipe away our sins.
        || 1 ||   Reflect upon the essence of reality, O Saintly beings,
        and no troubles shall afflict you. All of the thieves shall be
        destroyed, as the Gurmukhs remain wakeful.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Take wisdom and humility as your supplies, and burn away the
        poison of pride. True is that shop, and perfect the transaction;
        deal only in the merchandise of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   They alone are accepted and approved, who dedicate
        their souls, bodies and wealth. Those who are pleasing to their
        God, celebrate in happiness.  || 3 ||   Those fools, who drink
        in the wine of evil-mindedness, become the husbands of prostitutes.
        But those who are imbued with the sublime essence of the Lord,
        O Nanak, are intoxicated with the Truth.  || 4 || 12 || 114 ||
        AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  I made the effort; I did it, and made a
        beginning. I live by chanting and meditating on the Naam. The
        Guru has implanted this Mantra within me.  || 1 ||   I fall at
        the Feet of the True Guru, who has dispelled my doubts. Bestowing
        His Mercy, God has dressed me, and decorated me with the Truth.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Taking me by the hand, He made me His own,
        through the True Order of His Command. That gift which God gave
        to me, is perfect greatness.  || 2 ||   Forever and ever, sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and chant the Name of the Destroyer
        of ego. My vows have been honored, by the Grace of God and the
        True Guru, who has showered His Mercy.  || 3 ||   The Perfect
        Guru has given the wealth of the Naam, and the profit of singing
        the Lord's Glorious Praises. The Saints are the traders,
        O Nanak, and the Infinite Lord God is their Banker.  || 4 || 13
        || 115 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who has You as His Master,
        O God, is blessed with great destiny. He is happy, and forever
        at peace; his doubts and fears are all dispelled.  || 1 ||   I
        am the slave of the Lord of the Universe; my Master is the greatest
        of all. He is the Creator, the Cause of causes; He is my True

        and accepted.  || 3 ||   How rare is that person who drinks in
        the Ambrosial Essence of the Lord's Kirtan. Nanak has obtained
        the commodity of the One Name; he lives by chanting and meditating
        on it within his heart.  || 4 || 14 || 116 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH

        understanding within me. Serve the Holy Saints lovingly, and find

        Master, and all call Him their own. She alone dwells in peace,
        O Nanak, whom the Lord adorns.  || 4 || 15 || 117 ||   AASAA,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Become the servant of the Saints, and learn this
        way of life. Of all virtues, the most sublime virtue is to see
        your Husband Lord near at hand.  || 1 ||   So, dye this mind of
        yours with the color of the Lord's Love. Renounce cleverness
        and cunning, and know that the Sustainer of the world is with
        you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever your Husband Lord says, accept
        that, and make it your decoration. Forget the love of duality,
        and chew upon this betel leaf.  || 2 ||   Make the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad your lamp, and let your bed be Truth. Twenty-four
        hours a day, stand with your palms pressed together, and the Lord,
        your King, shall meet you.  || 3 ||   She alone is cultured and
        embellished, and she alone is of incomparable beauty. She alone
        is the happy soul-bride, O Nanak, who is pleasing to the Creator
        Lord.  || 4 || 16 || 118 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  As long as
        there are doubts in the mind, the mortal staggers and falls. The
        Guru removed my doubts, and I have obtained my place of rest.
        || 1 ||   Those quarrelsome enemies have been overcome, through
        the Guru. I have now escaped from them, and they have run away
        from me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is concerned with 'mine
        and yours', and so he is held in bondage. When the Guru dispelled
        my ignorance, then the noose of death was cut away from my neck.
        || 2 ||   As long as he does not understand the Command of God's
        Will, he remains miserable. Meeting with the Guru, he comes to
        recognize God's Will, and then, he becomes happy.  || 3 ||
        I have no enemies and no adversaries; no one is wicked to me.
        That servant, who performs the Lord's service, O Nanak, is
        the slave of the Lord Master.  || 4 || 17 || 119 ||   AASAA, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  Peace, celestial poise and absolute bliss are obtained,

        affect those who do not keep the Lord in the mind. The Messenger
        of Death does not approach those who are pleasing to the Lord
        God.  || 2 ||   Donations to charity, meditation and penance  - 
        above all of them is the Naam. One who chants with his tongue
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har  -  his works are brought to
        perfect completion.  || 3 ||   His fears are removed, and his
        doubts and attachments are gone; he sees none other than God.

        is the Supreme King of all; who else is equal to Him?  || 1 ||

        Him. I search and search for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
        Even Brahma and the sages Sanak, Sanandan, Sanaatan and Sanat
        Kumar, find it difficult to obtain the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence.  || 2 ||   He is unapproachable and unfathomable; His
        wisdom is deep and profound; His value cannot be appraised. I
        have taken to the Sanctuary of the True Lord, the Primal Being,
        and I meditate on the True Guru.  || 3 ||   God, the Lord Master,
        has become kind and compassionate; He has cut the noose of death

        again.  || 4 || 1 || 121 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Inwardly, I
        sing His Praises, and outwardly, I sing His Praises; I sing His
        Praises while awake and asleep. I am a trader in the Name of the
        Lord of the Universe; He has given it to me as my supplies, to
        carry with me.  || 1 ||   I have forgotten and forsaken other
        things. The Perfect Guru has given me the Gift of the Naam; this
        alone is my Support.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I sing His Praises
        while suffering, and I sing His Praises while I am at peace as

        quenched.  || 2 ||   I sing His Praises during the day, and I
