      <p> Whatever is planted in the farm of the body, shall come and stand
        before them in the end. Nanak offers this prayer: O Lord God,
        please forgive me, and unite me with Yourself.  || 41 ||   The
        mortal being does not understand the comings and goings of reincarnation;
        he does not see the Court of the Lord. He is wrapped up in emotional
        attachment and Maya, and within his being is the darkness of ignorance.
        The sleeping person wakes, only when he is hit on the head by
        a heavy club. The Gurmukhs dwell upon the Lord; they find the
        door of salvation. O Nanak, they themselves are saved, and all
        their relatives are carried across as well.  || 42 ||   Whoever
        dies in the Word of the Shabad, is known to be truly dead. By
        Guru's Grace, the mortal is satisfied by the sublime essence
        of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he
        is recognized in the Court of the Lord. Without the Shabad, everyone
        is dead. The self-willed manmukh dies; his life is wasted. Those
        who do not remember the Name of the Lord, shall cry in pain in
        the end. O Nanak, whatever the Creator Lord does, comes to pass.
        || 43 ||   The Gurmukhs never grow old; within them is intuitive
        understanding and spiritual wisdom. They chant the Praises of
        the Lord, forever and ever; deep within, they intuitively meditate
        on the Lord. They dwell forever in blissful knowledge of the Lord;
        they look upon pain and pleasure as one and the same. They see
        the One Lord in all, and realize the Lord, the Supreme Soul of
        all.  || 44 ||   The self-willed manmukhs are like stupid children;
        they do not keep the Lord in their thoughts. They do all their
        deeds in egotism, and they must answer to the Righteous Judge
        of Dharma. The Gurmukhs are good and immaculately pure; they are
        embellished and exalted with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        Not even a tiny bit of filth sticks to them; they walk in harmony
        with the Will of the True Guru. The filth of the manmukhs is not
        washed away, even if they wash hundreds of times. O Nanak, the
        Gurmukhs are united with the Lord; they merge into the Guru's
        Being.  || 45 ||   How can someone do bad things, and still live
        with himself? By his own anger, he only burns himself. The self-willed
        manmukh drives himself crazy with worries and stubborn struggles.
        But those who become Gurmukh understand everything. O Nanak, the
        Gurmukh struggles with his own mind.  || 46 ||   Those who do
        not serve the True Guru, the Primal Being, and do not reflect
        upon the Word of the Shabad - do not call them human beings;
        they are just animals and stupid beasts. They have no spiritual
        wisdom or meditation within their beings; they are not in love
        with the Lord. The self-willed manmukhs die in evil and corruption;
        they die and are reborn, again and again. They alone live, who
        join with the living; enshrine the Lord, the Lord of Life, within
        your heart. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs look beautiful in that Court
        of the True Lord.  || 47 ||   The Lord built the Harimandir, the
        Temple of the Lord; the Lord dwells within it. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, I have found the Lord; my emotional attachment to Maya
        has been burnt away. Countless things are in the Harimandir, the
        Temple of the Lord; contemplate the Naam, and the nine treasures
        will be yours. Blessed is that happy soul-bride, O Nanak, who,
        as Gurmukh, seeks and finds the Lord. By great good fortune, one
        searches the temple of the body-fortress, and finds the Lord within
        the heart.  || 48 ||   The self-willed manmukhs wander lost in
        the ten directions, led by intense desire, greed and corruption. <br>

      <p> Their attachment to Maya does not cease; they die, only to be
        reborn, over and over again. Serving the True Guru, peace is found;
        intense desire and corruption are discarded. The pains of death
        and birth are taken away; servant Nanak reflects upon the Word
        of the Shabad.  || 49 ||   Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, O mortal being, and you shall be honored in the Court of
        the Lord. All your sins and terrible mistakes shall be taken away,
        and you shall be rid of your pride and egotism. The heart-lotus
        of the Gurmukh blossoms forth, realizing God, the Soul of all.
        O Lord God, please shower Your Mercy upon servant Nanak, that
        he may chant the Name of the Lord.  || 50 ||   In Dhanaasaree,
        the soul-bride is known to be wealthy, O Siblings of Destiny,
        when she works for the True Guru. She surrenders her body, mind
        and soul, O Siblings of Destiny, and lives according to the Hukam
        of His Command. I sit where He wishes me to sit, O Siblings of
        Destiny; wherever He sends me, I go. There is no other wealth
        as great, O Siblings of Destiny; such is the greatness of the
        True Name. I sing forever the Glorious Praises of the True Lord;
        I shall remain with the True One forever. So wear the clothes
        of His Glorious Virtues and goodness, O Siblings of Destiny; eat
        and enjoy the flavor of your own honor. How can I praise Him,
        O Siblings of Destiny? I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision
        of His Darshan. Great is the Glorious Greatness of the True Guru,
        O Siblings of Destiny; if one is blessed with good karma, He is
        found. Some do not know how to submit to the Hukam of His Command,
        O Siblings of Destiny; they wander around lost in the love of
        duality. They find no place of rest in the Sangat, O Siblings
        of Destiny; they find no place to sit. Nanak: they alone submit
        to His Command, O Siblings of Destiny, who are pre-destined to
        live the Name. I am a sacrifice to them, O Siblings of Destiny,
        I am forever a sacrifice to them.  || 51 ||   Those beards are
        true, which brush the feet of the True Guru. Those who serve their
        Guru night and day, live in bliss, night and day. O Nanak, their
        faces appear beautiful in the Court of the True Lord.  || 52 ||
        True are the faces and true are the beards, of those who speak
        the Truth and live the Truth. The True Word of the Shabad abides
        in their minds; they are absorbed in the True Guru. True is their
        capital, and true is their wealth; they are blessed with the ultimate
        status. They hear the Truth, they believe in the Truth; they act
        and work in the Truth. They are given a place in the Court of
        the True Lord; they are absorbed in the True Lord. O Nanak, without
        the True Guru, the True Lord is not found. The self-willed manmukhs
        leave, wandering around lost.  || 53 ||   The sparrow-hawk cries,
  &quot;Pri-o! Pri-o! Beloved! Beloved!&quot; She is in love
        with the treasure, the water. Meeting with the Guru, the cooling,
        soothing water is obtained, and all pain is taken away. My thirst
        has been quenched, and intuitive peace and poise have welled up;
        my cries and screams of anguish are past. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs
        are peaceful and tranquil; they enshrine the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, within their hearts.  || 54 ||   O sparrow-hawk, chirp
        the True Name, and let yourself be attuned to the True Lord. Your
        word shall be accepted and approved, if you speak as Gurmukh.
        Remember the Shabad, and your thirst shall be relieved; surrender
        to the Will of the Lord. <br>

      <p> The clouds are heavy, hanging low, and the rain is pouring down
        on all sides; the rain-drop is received, with natural ease. From
        water, everything is produced; without water, thirst is not quenched.
        O Nanak, whoever drinks in the Water of the Lord, shall never
        feel hunger again.  || 55 ||   O sparrow-hawk, speak the Shabad,
        the True Word of God, with natural peace and poise. Everything
        is with you; the True Guru will show you this. So understand your
        own self, and meet your Beloved; His Grace shall rain down in
        torrents. Drop by drop, the Ambrosial Nectar rains down softly
        and gently; thirst and hunger are completely gone. Your cries
        and screams of anguish have ceased; your light shall merge into
        the Light. O Nanak, the happy soul-brides sleep in peace; they
        are absorbed in the True Name.  || 56 ||   The Primal Lord and
        Master has sent out the True Hukam of His Command. Indra mercifully
        sends forth the rain, which falls in torrents. The body and mind
        of the sparrow-hawk are happy. only when the rain-drop falls into
        its mouth. The corn grows high, wealth increases, and the earth
        is embellished with beauty. Night and day, people worship the
        Lord with devotion, and are absorbed in the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. The True Lord Himself forgives them, and showering them
        with His Mercy, He leads them to walk in His Will. O brides, sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and be absorbed in the True
        Word of His Shabad. Let the Fear of God be your decoration, and
        remain lovingly attuned to the True Lord. O Nanak, the Naam abides
        in the mind, and the mortal is saved in the Court of the Lord.
        || 57 ||   The sparrow-hawk wanders all over the earth, soaring
        high through the skies. But it obtains the drop of water, only
        when it meets the True Guru, and then, its hunger and thirst are
        relieved. Soul and body and all belong to Him; everything is His.
        He knows everything, without being told; unto whom should we offer
        our prayers? O Nanak, the One Lord is prevading and permeating
        each and every heart; the Word of the Shabad brings illumination.
        || 58 ||   O Nanak, the season of spring comes to one who serves
        the True Guru. The Lord rains His Mercy down upon him, and his
        mind and body totally blossom forth; the entire world becomes
        green and rejuvenated.  || 59 ||   The Word of the Shabad brings
        eternal spring; it rejuvenates the mind and body. O Nanak, do
        not forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, which has created everyone.
        || 60 ||   O Nanak, it is the spring season, for those Gurmukhs,
        within whose minds the Lord abides. When the Lord showers His
        Mercy, the mind and body blossom forth, and all the world turns
        green and lush.  || 61 ||   In the early hours of the morning,
        whose name should we chant? Chant the Name of the Transcendent
        Lord, who is All-powerful to create and destroy.  || 62 ||   The
        Persian wheel also cries out, &quot;Too! Too! You! You!&quot;,
        with sweet and sublime sounds. Our Lord and Master is always present;
        why do you cry out to Him in such a loud voice? I am a sacrifice
        to that Lord who created the world, and who loves it. Give up
        your selfishness, and then you shall meet your Husband Lord. Consider
        this Truth. Speaking in shallow egotism, no one understands the
        Ways of God. The forests and fields, and all the three worlds
        meditate on You, O Lord; this is the way they pass their days
        and nights forever. <br>

      <p> Without the True Guru, no one finds the Lord. People have grown
        weary of thinking about it. But if the Lord casts His Glance of
        Grace, then He Himself embellishes us. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs meditate
        on the Lord; blessed and approved is their coming into the world.
        || 63 ||   Yoga is not obtained by wearing saffron robes; Yoga
        is not obtained by wearing dirty robes. O Nanak, Yoga is obtained
        even while sitting in your own home, by following the Teachings
        of the True Guru.  || 64 ||   You may wander in all four directions,
        and read the Vedas throughout the four ages. O Nanak, if you meet
        with the True Guru, the Lord shall come to dwell within your mind,
        and you shall find the door of salvation.  || 65 ||   O Nanak,
        the Hukam, the Command of your Lord and Master, is prevailing.
        The intellectually confused person wanders around lost, misled
        by his fickle consciousness. If you make friends with the self-willed
        manmukhs, O friend, who can you ask for peace? Make friends with
        the Gurmukhs, and focus your consciousness on the True Guru. The
        root of birth and death will be cut away, and then, you shall
        find peace, O friend.  || 66 ||   The Lord Himself instructs those
        who are misguided, when He casts His Glance of Grace. O Nanak,
        those who are not blessed by His Glance of Grace, cry and weep
        and wail.  || 67 || <br>

        soul-brides who, as Gurmukh, meet their Sovereign Lord King. The
        Light of God shines within them; O Nanak, they are absorbed in
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Waaho! Waaho! Blessed
        and Great is the True Guru, the Primal Being, who has realized
        the True Lord. Meeting Him, thirst is quenched, and the body and
        mind are cooled and soothed. Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is
        the True Guru, the True Primal Being, who looks upon all alike.
        Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the True Guru, who has no hatred;
        slander and praise are all the same to Him. Waaho! Waaho! Blessed
        and Great is the All-knowing True Guru, who has realized God within.
        Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the Formless True Guru, who
        has no end or limitation. Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the
        True Guru, who implants the Truth within. O Nanak, Blessed and
        Great is the True Guru, through whom the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is received.  || 2 ||   For the Gurmukh, the true Song of
        Praise is to chant the Name of the Lord God. Chanting the Praises
        of the Lord, their minds are in ecstasy. By great good fortune,
        they find the Lord, the Embodiment of perfect, supreme bliss.
        Servant Nanak praises the Naam, the Name of the Lord; no obstacle
        will block his mind or body.  || 3 ||   I am in love with my Beloved;
        how can I meet my Dear Friend? I seek that friend, who is embellished
        with Truth. The True Guru is my Friend; if I meet Him, I will
        offer this mind as a sacrifice to Him. He has shown me my Beloved
        Lord, my Friend, the Creator. O Nanak, I was searching for my
        Beloved; the True Guru has shown me that He has been with me all
        the time.  || 4 ||   I stand by the side of the road, waiting
        for You; O my Friend, I hope that You will come. If only someone
        would come today and unite me in Union with my Beloved. <br>

      <p> I would cut my living body into four pieces for anyone who shows
        me my Beloved. O Nanak, when the Lord becomes merciful, then He
        leads us to meet the Perfect Guru.  || 5 ||   The power of egotism
        prevails within, and the body is controlled by Maya; the false
        ones come and go in reincarnation. If someone does not obey the
        Command of the True Guru, he cannot cross over the treacherous
        world-ocean. Whoever is blessed with the Lord's Glance
        of Grace, walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. The
        Blessed Vision of the True Guru's Darshan is fruitful;
        through it, one obtains the fruits of his desires. I touch the
        feet of those who believe in and obey the True Guru. Nanak is
        the slave of those who, night and day, remain lovingly attuned
        to the Lord.  || 6 ||   Those who are in love with their Beloved
        - how can they find satisfaction without His Darshan? O
        Nanak, the Gurmukhs meet Him with ease, and this mind blossoms
        forth in joy.  || 7 ||   Those who are in love with their Beloved
        - how can they live without Him? When they see their Husband
        Lord, O Nanak, they are rejuvenated.  || 8 ||   Those Gurmukhs
        who are filled with love for You, my True Beloved, O Nanak, remain
        immersed in the Lord's Love, night and day.  || 9 ||  
        The love of the Gurmukh is true; through it, the True Beloved
        is attained. Night and day, remain in bliss, O Nanak, immersed
        in intuitive peace and poise.  || 10 ||   True love and affection
        are obtained from the Perfect Guru. They never break, O Nanak,
        if one sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 11 ||   How
        can those who have true love within them live without their Husband
        Lord? The Lord unites the Gurmukhs with Himself, O Nanak; they
        were separated from Him for such a long time.  || 12 ||   You
        grant Your Grace to those whom You Yourself bless with love and
        affection. O Lord, please let Nanak meet with You; please bless
        this beggar with Your Name.  || 13 ||   The Gurmukh laughs, and
        the Gurmukh cries. Whatever the Gurmukh does, is devotional worship.
        Whoever becomes Gurmukh contemplates the Lord. The Gurmukh, O
        Nanak, crosses over to the other shore.  || 14 ||   Those who
        have the Naam within, contemplate the Word of the Guru's
        Bani. Their faces are always radiant in the Court of the True
        Lord. Sitting down and standing up, they never forget the Creator,
        who forgives them. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are united with the Lord.
        Those united by the Creator Lord, shall never be separated again.
        || 15 ||   To work for the Guru, or a spiritual teacher, is terribly
        difficult, but it brings the most excellent peace. The Lord casts
        His Glance of Grace, and inspires love and affection. Joined to
        the service of the True Guru, the mortal being crosses over the
        terrifying world-ocean. The fruits of the mind's desires
        are obtained, with clear contemplation and discriminating understanding
        within. O Nanak, meeting the True Guru, God is found; He is the
        Eradicator of all sorrow.  || 16 ||   The self-willed manmukh
        may perform service, but his consciousness is attached to the
        love of duality. Through Maya, his emotional attachment to children,
        spouse and relatives increases. <br>

      <p> He shall be called to account in the Court of the Lord, and in
        the end, no one will be able to save him. Without the Lord's
        Name, all is pain. Attachment to Maya is agonizingly painful.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukh comes to see, that attachment to Maya separates
        all from the Lord.  || 17 ||   The Gurmukh obeys the Order of
        her Husband Lord God; through the Hukam of His Command, she finds
        peace. In His Will, she serves; in His Will, she worship and adores
        Him. In His Will, she merges in absorption. His Will is her fast,
        vow, purity and self-discipline; through it, she obtains the fruits
        of her mind's desires. She is always and forever the happy,
        pure soul-bride, who realizes His Will; she serves the True Guru,
        inspired by loving absorption. O Nanak, those upon whom the Lord
        showers His Mercy, are merged and immersed in His Will.  || 18
        ||   The wretched, self-willed manmukhs do not realize His Will;
        they continually act in ego. By ritualistic fasts, vows, purities,
        self-disciplines and worship ceremonies, they still cannot get
        rid of their hypocrisy and doubt. Inwardly, they are impure, pierced
        through by attachment to Maya; they are like elephants, who throw
        dirt all over themselves right after their bath. They do not even
        think of the One who created them. Without thinking of Him, they
        cannot find peace. O Nanak, the Primal Creator has made the drama
        of the Universe; all act as they are pre-ordained.  || 19 || 
        The Gurmukh has faith; his mind is contented and satisfied. Night
        and day, he serves the Lord, absorbed in Him. The Guru, the True
        Guru, is within; all worship and adore Him. Everyone comes to
        see the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. So believe in the True
        Guru, the supreme sublime Contemplator. Meeting with Him, hunger
        and thirst are completely relieved. I am forever a sacrifice to
        my Guru, who leads me to meet the True Lord God. O Nanak, those
        who come and fall at the Feet of the Guru are blessed with the
        karma of Truth.  || 20 ||   That Beloved, with whom I am in love,
        that Friend of mine is with me. I wander around inside and outside,
        but I always keep Him enshrined within my heart.  || 21 ||   Those
        who meditate on the Lord single-mindedly, with one-pointed concentration,
        link their consciousness to the True Guru. They are rid of pain,
        hunger, and the great illness of egotism; lovingly attuned to
        the Lord, they become free of pain. They sing His Praises, and
        chant His Praises; in His Glorious Praises, they sleep in absorption.
        O Nanak, through the Perfect Guru, they come to meet God with
        intuitive peace and poise.  || 22 ||   The self-willed manmukhs
        are emotionally attached to Maya; they are not in love with the
        Naam. They practice falsehood, gather falsehood, and eat the food
        of falsehood. Gathering the poisonous wealth and property of Maya,
        they die; in the end, they are all reduced to ashes. They perform
        religious rituals of purity and self-discipline, but they are
        filled with greed, evil and corruption. O Nanak, the actions of
        the self-willed manmukhs are not accepted; in the Court of the
        Lord, they are miserable.  || 23 ||   Among all Ragas, that one
        is sublime, O Siblings of Destiny, by which the Lord comes to
        abide in the mind. Those Ragas which are in the Sound-current
        of the Naad are totally true; their value cannot be expressed.
        Those Ragas which are not in the Sound-current of the Naad -
        by these, the Lord's Will cannot be understood. O Nanak,
        they alone are right, who understand the Will of the True Guru. <br>

      <p> Everything happens as He wills.  || 24 ||   The Ambrosial Nectar
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within the True Guru. Following
        the Guru's Teachings, one meditates on the Immaculate Naam,
        the Pure and Holy Naam. The Ambrosial Word of His Bani is the
        true essence. It comes to abide in the mind of the Gurmukh. The
        heart-lotus blossoms forth, and one's light merges in the
        Light. O Nanak, they alone meet with the True Guru, who have such
        pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon their foreheads.  || 25 ||
        Within the self-willed manmukhs is the fire of desire; their
        hunger does not depart. Emotional attachments to relatives are
        totally false; they remain engrossed in falsehood. Night and day,
        they are troubled by anxiety; bound to anxiety, they depart. Their
        comings and goings in reincarnation never end; they do their deeds
        in egotism. But in the Guru's Sanctuary, they are saved,
        O Nanak, and set free.  || 26 ||   The True Guru meditates on
        the Lord, the Primal Being. The Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
        loves the True Guru. Those who join the Sat Sangat, and serve
        the True Guru - the Guru unites them in the Lord's
        Union. This world, this universe, is a terrifying ocean. On the
        Boat of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Guru carries us across.
        The Sikhs of the Guru accept and obey the Lord's Will;
        the Perfect Guru carries them across. O Lord, please bless me
        with the dust of the feet of the Guru's Sikhs. I am a sinner
        - please save me. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny
        written upon their foreheads by the Lord God, come to meet Guru
        Nanak. The Messenger of Death is beaten and driven away; we are
        saved in the Court of the Lord. Blessed and celebrated are the
        Sikhs of the Guru; in His Pleasure, the Lord unites them in His
        Union.  || 27 ||   The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord's
        Name within me; it has dispelled my doubts from within. Singing
        the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord's Name, the Lord's
        path is illuminated and shown to His Sikhs. Conquering my egotism,
        I remain lovingly attuned to the One Lord; the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, dwells within me. I follow the Guru's Teachings,
        and so the Messenger of Death cannot even see me; I am immersed
        in the True Name. The Creator Himself is All-pervading; as He
        pleases, He links us to His Name. Servant Nanak lives, chanting
        the Name. Without the Name, he dies in an instant.  || 28 || 
        Within the minds of the faithless cynics is the disease of egotism;
        these evil people wander around lost, deluded by doubt. O Nanak,
        this disease is eradicated only by meeting with the True Guru,
        the Holy Friend.  || 29 ||   Following the Guru's Teachings,
        chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Attracted by the Lord's
        Love, day and night, the body-robe is imbued with the Lord's
        Love. I have not found any being like the Lord, although I have
        searched and looked all over the world. The Guru, the True Guru,
        has implanted the Naam within; now, my mind does not waver or
        wander anywhere else. Servant Nanak is the slave of the Lord,
        the slave of the slaves of the Guru, the True Guru.  || 30 || <br>

        not turn their faces away from Him - they realize Him.
        The false, immature lovers do not know the way of love, and so
        they fall.  || 1 ||   Without my Master, I will burn my silk and
        satin clothes in the fire. Even rolling in the dust, I look beautiful,
        O Nanak, if my Husband Lord is with me.  || 2 ||   Through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, I worship and adore the Naam,
        with love and balanced detachment. When the five enemies are overcome,
        O Nanak, this musical measure of Raga Maru becomes frtuiful. 
        || 3 ||   When I have the One Lord, I have tens of thousands.
        Otherwise, people like me beg from door to door. O Brahmin, your
        life has passed away uselessly; you have forgotten the One who
        created you.  || 4 ||   In Raga Sorat'h, drink in this
        sublime essence, which never loses its taste. O Nanak, singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name, one's reputation
        is immaculate in the Court of the Lord.  || 5 ||   No one can
        kill those whom God Himself protects. The treasure of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, is within them. They cherish His Glorious
        Virtues forever. They take the Support of the One, the Inaccessible
        Lord; they enshrine God in their mind and body. They are imbued
        with the Love of the Infinite Lord, and no one can wipe it away.
        The Gurmukhs sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; they obtain
        the most excellent celestial peace and poise. O Nanak, they enshrine
        the treasure of the Naam in their hearts.  || 6 ||   Whatever
        God does, accept that as good; leave behind all other judgements.
        He shall cast His Glance of Grace, and attach you to Himself.
        Instruct yourself with the Teachings, and doubt will depart from
        within. Everyone does that which is pre-ordained by destiny. Everything
        is under His control; there is no other place at all. Nanak is
        in peace and bliss, accepting the Will of God.  || 7 ||   Those
        who meditate in remembrance on the Perfect Guru, are exalted and
        uplifted. O Nanak, dwelling on the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        all affairs are resolved.  || 8 ||   The sinners act, and generate
        bad karma, and then they weep and wail. O Nanak, just as the churning
        stick churns the butter, so does the Righteous Judge of Dharma
        churn them.  || 9 ||   Meditating on the Naam, O friend, the treasure
        of life is won. O Nanak, speaking in Righteousness, one's
        world becomes sanctified.  || 10 ||   I am stuck in an evil place,
        trusting the sweet words of an evil advisor. O Nanak, they alone
        are saved, who have such good destiny inscribed upon their foreheads.
        || 11 ||   They alone sleep and dream in peace, who are imbued
        with the Love of their Husband Lord. Those who have been separated
        from the Love of their Master, scream and cry twenty-four hours
        a day.  || 12 ||   Millions are asleep, in the false illusion
        of Maya. O Nanak, they alone are awake and aware, who chant the
        Naam with their tongues.  || 13 ||   Seeing the mirage, the optical
        illusion, the people are confused and deluded. Those who worship
        and adore the True Lord, O Nanak, their minds and bodies are beautiful.

      <p> The All-powerful Supreme Lord God, the Infinite Primal Being,
        is the Saving Grace of sinners. Those whom He saves, meditate
        in remembrance on the Creator Lord.  || 15 ||   Forsake duality
        and the ways of evil; focus your consciousness on the One Lord.
        In the love of duality, O Nanak, the mortals are being washed
        downstream.  || 16 ||   In the markets and bazaars of the three
        qualities, the merchants make their deals. Those who load the
        true merchandise are the true traders.  || 17 ||   Those who do
        not know the way of love are foolish; they wander lost and confused.
        O Nanak, forgetting the Lord, they fall into the deep, dark pit
        of hell.  || 18 ||   In his mind, the mortal does not forget Maya;
        he begs for more and more wealth. That God does not even come
        into his consciousness; O Nanak, it is not in his karma.  || 19
        ||   The mortal does not run out of capital, as long as the Lord
        Himself is merciful. The Word of the Shabad is Guru Nanak's
        inexhaustible treasure; this wealth and capital never runs out,
        no matter how much it is spent and consumed.  || 20 ||   If I
        could find wings for sale, I would buy them with an equal weight
        of my flesh. I would attach them to my body, and seek out and
        find my Friend.  || 21 ||   My Friend is the True Supreme King,
        the King over the heads of kings. Sitting by His side, we are

        || 1 ||   Why are you engrossed in sin and corruption? You are

        wealth, property, peace and beautiful mansions. Says Nanak, listen,

        is made up of the five elements; you are clever and wise -

        Dear Lord abides in each and every heart; the Saints proclaim

        is not touched by pleasure or pain, greed, emotional attachment
        and egotistical pride - says Nanak, listen, mind: he is
        the very image of God.  || 13 ||   One who is beyond praise and
        slander, who looks upon gold and iron alike - says Nanak,
        listen, mind: know that such a person is liberated.  || 14 ||
        One who is not affected by pleasure or pain, who looks upon
        friend and enemy alike - says Nanak, listen, mind: know
        that such a person is liberated.  || 15 ||   One who does not
        frighten anyone, and who is not afraid of anyone else -
        says Nanak, listen, mind: call him spiritually wise.  || 16 ||
        One who has forsaken all sin and corruption, who wears the robes
        of neutral detachment - says Nanak, listen, mind: good
        destiny is written on his forehead.  || 17 ||   One who renounces
        Maya and possessiveness and is detached from everything -
        says Nanak, listen, mind: God abides in his heart.  || 18 || 
        That mortal, who forsakes egotism, and realizes the Creator Lord
        - says Nanak, that person is liberated; O mind, know this
        as true.  || 19 ||   In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Name of
        the Lord is the Destroyer of fear, the Eradicator of evil-mindedness.
        Night and day, O Nanak, whoever vibrates and meditates on the
        Lord's Name, sees all of his works brought to fruition.
        || 20 ||   Vibrate with your tongue the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord of the Universe; with your ears, hear the Lord's Name.
        Says Nanak, listen, man: you shall not have to go to the house
        of Death.  || 21 ||   That mortal who renounces possessiveness,
        greed, emotional attachment and egotism - says Nanak, he
        himself is saved, and he saves many others as well.  || 22 ||
        Like a dream and a show, so is this world, you must know. None
        of this is true, O Nanak, without God.  || 23 ||   Night and day,

        O Nanak, there is scarcely anyone, who keeps the Lord in his consciousness.

        26 ||   If you yearn for eternal peace, then seek the Sanctuary
        of the Lord. Says Nanak, listen, mind: this human body is difficult
        to obtain.  || 27 ||   For the sake of Maya, the fools and ignorant
        people run all around. Says Nanak, without meditating on the Lord,

        there is no one at all. Says Nanak, vibrate, and meditate on the
        Lord; He shall be your only Help and Support in the end.  || 32
        ||   Mortals wander lost and confused through countless lifetimes;
        their fear of death is never removed. Says Nanak, vibrate and
        meditate on the Lord, and you shall dwell in the Fearless Lord.
        || 33 ||   I have tried so many things, but the pride of my mind
        has not been dispelled. I am engrossed in evil-mindedness, Nanak.
        O God, please save me!  || 34 ||   Childhood, youth and old age
        - know these as the three stages of life. Says Nanak, without
        meditating on the Lord, everything is useless; you must appreciate
        this.  || 35 ||   You have not done what you should have done;
        you are entangled in the web of greed. Nanak, your time is past
        and gone; why are you crying now, you blind fool?  || 36 ||  
        The mind is absorbed in Maya - it cannot escape it, my
        friend. Nanak, it is like a picture painted on the wall -
        it cannot leave it.  || 37 ||   The man wishes for something,
        but something different happens. He plots to deceive others, O
        Nanak, but he places the noose around his own neck instead.  ||
        38 ||   People make all sorts of efforts to find peace and pleasure,
        but no one tries to earn pain. Says Nanak, listen, mind: whatever
        pleases God comes to pass.  || 39 ||   The world wanders around
        begging, but the Lord is the Giver of all. Says Nanak, meditate
        in remembrance on Him, and all your works will be successful.
        || 40 ||   Why do you take such false pride in yourself? You
        must know that the world is just a dream. None of this is yours;
        Nanak proclaims this truth.  || 41 ||   You are so proud of your
        body; it shall perish in an instant, my friend. That mortal who
        chants the Praises of the Lord, O Nanak, conquers the world. 
        || 42 ||   That person, who meditates in remembrance on the Lord
        in his heart, is liberated - know this well. There is no
        difference between that person and the Lord: O Nanak, accept this
        as the Truth.  || 43 ||   That person, who does not feel devotion
        to God in his mind - O Nanak, know that his body is like
        that of a pig, or a dog.  || 44 ||   A dog never abandons the
        home of his master. O Nanak, in just the same way, vibrate, and
        meditate on the Lord, single-mindedly, with one-pointed consciousness.
        || 45 ||   Those who make pilgrimages to sacred shrines, observe
        ritualistic fasts and make donations to charity while still taking
        pride in their minds - O Nanak, their actions are useless,
        like the elephant, who takes a bath, and then rolls in the dust.
        || 46 ||   The head shakes, the feet stagger, and the eyes become
        dull and weak. Says Nanak, this is your condition. <br>

      <p> And even now, you have not savored the sublime essence of the
        Lord.  || 47 ||   I had looked upon the world as my own, but no
        one belongs to anyone else. O Nanak, only devotional worship of
        the Lord is permanent; enshrine this in your mind.  || 48 || 
        The world and its affairs are totally false; know this well,
        my friend. Says Nanak, it is like a wall of sand; it shall not
        endure.  || 49 ||   Raam Chand passed away, as did Raawan, even
        though he had lots of relatives. Says Nanak, nothing lasts forever;
        the world is like a dream.  || 50 ||   People become anxious,
        when something unexpected happens. This is the way of the world,
        O Nanak; nothing is stable or permanent.  || 51 ||   Whatever
        has been created shall be destroyed; everyone shall perish, today
        or tomorrow. O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and
        give up all other entanglements.  || 52 ||   DOHRAA:  My strength
        is exhausted, and I am in bondage; I cannot do anything at all.
        Says Nanak, now, the Lord is my Support; He will help me, as He
        did the elephant.  || 53 ||   My strength has been restored, and
        my bonds have been broken; now, I can do everything. Nanak: everything
        is in Your hands, Lord; You are my Helper and Support.  || 54
        ||   My associates and companions have all deserted me; no one
        remains with me. Says Nanak, in this tragedy, the Lord alone is
        my Support.  || 55 ||   The Naam remains; the Holy Saints remain;
        the Guru, the Lord of the Universe, remains. Says Nanak, how rare
        are those who chant the Guru's Mantra in this world.  ||
        56 ||   I have enshrined the Lord's Name within my heart;
        there is nothing equal to it. Meditating in remembrance on it,
        my troubles are taken away; I have received the Blessed Vision
        of Your Darshan.  || 57 || 1 || <br>

        Truth, Contentment and Contemplation. The Ambrosial Nectar of
        the Naam, the Name of our Lord and Master, has been placed upon
        it as well; it is the Support of all. One who eats it and enjoys
        it shall be saved. This thing can never be forsaken; keep this
        always and forever in your mind. The dark world-ocean is crossed
        over, by grasping the Feet of the Lord; O Nanak, it is all the
        extension of God.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have not
        appreciated what You have done for me, Lord; only You can make
        me worthy. I am unworthy - I have no worth or virtues at
        all. You have taken pity on me. You took pity on me, and blessed
        me with Your Mercy, and I have met the True Guru, my Friend. O
        Nanak, if I am blessed with the Naam, I live, and my body and
        mind blossom forth.  || 1 || <br>

      <p> It is accompanied by the voices of its five Raaginis: First is
        Bhairavee, then Bilaavalee; then the songs of Punni-aakee and
        Bangalee; and then comes Asalaykhee. Then, there are the eight
        sons of Bhairao: the sounds of Pancham, Harakh and Disaakh; the
        songs of Bangaalam, Madh and Maadhav. Lalat and Bilaaval -
        each gives out its own melody, in the hands of those who make
        music.  || 1 ||   In the second family is Maalakausak, who brings
        his five Raaginis: Gondakaree and Dayv Gandhaaree, the voices
        of Gandhaaree and Seehutee, and the fifth song of Dhanaasaree.
        This chain of Maalakausak brings along Maaroo, Masta-ang and Mayvaaraa,
        Prabal, Chandakausak, Khau, Khat and Bauraanad singing. These
        are the eight sons of Maalakausak.  || 1 ||   Then comes Hindol
        with his five wives and eight sons; it rises in waves when the
        sweet-voiced chorus sings.  || 1 ||   There come Taylangee and
        Darvakaree; Basantee and Sandoor follow; then Aheeree, the finest
        of women. She is also embellished with sons: Surmaanand and Bhaaskar
        come, Chandrabinb and Mangalan follow. Sarasbaan and Binodaa then
        come, and the thrilling songs of Basant and Kamodaa. These are
        the eight sons I have listed. Then comes the turn of Deepak. 
        || 1 ||   Kachhaylee, Patamanjaree and Todee are there; Kaamodee
        and Goojaree accompany Deepak.  || 1 ||   Kaalankaa, Kuntal and
        Raamaa, Kamalakusam and Champak are their names; Gauraa, Kaanaraa
        and Kaylaanaa; these are the eight sons of Deepak.  || 1 ||  
        All join together and sing Siree Raag, which also has five women:
        Bairaaree and Karnaatee, the songs of Gawree and Aasaavaree; then
        follows Sindhavee. These are the five wives of Siree Raag.  ||
        1 ||   Saaloo, Saarang, Saagaraa, Gond and Gambheer - the
        eight sons of Siree Raag - Gund, Kumb and Hameer.  || 1
        ||   In the sixth place, Maygh Raag is sung, with his five wives
        in accompaniment: Sorat'h, Gond, and the melody of Malaaree;
        then the harmonies of Aasaa are sung. And finally comes Soohau.
        These are the five with Maygh Raag.  || 1 ||   Bairaadhar, Gajadhar,
        Kaydaaraa, Jabaleedhar, Nat and Jaladhaaraa. Then come the songs
        of Shankar and Shi-aamaa. These are the names of the sons of Maygh
        Raag. So all together, they sing the six Raagas and the thirty
        Raaginis, and all the forty-eight sons of the Raagas.  || 1 ||
