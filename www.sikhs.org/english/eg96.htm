      <p> <font color="#000000">SHALOK:  O my Friend, I shall forever remain
        the dust of Your feet. Nanak seeks Your protection, and beholds
        You ever-present, here and now.  || 1 ||   SHABAD:  Those who
        receive the call in the last hours of the night, chant the Name
        of their Lord and Master. Tents, canopies, pavilions and carriages
        are prepared and made ready for them. You send out the call, Lord,
        to those who meditate on Your Name.  || 1 ||   Father, I am unfortunate,
        a fraud. I have not found Your Name; my mind is blind and deluded
        by doubt.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have enjoyed the tastes, and
        now my pains have come to fruition; such is my pre-ordained destiny,
        O my mother. Now my joys are few, and my pains are many. In utter
        agony, I pass my life.  || 2 ||   What separation could be worse
        than separation from the Lord? For those who are united with Him,
        what other union can there be? Praise the Lord and Master, who,
        having created this play, beholds it.  || 3 ||   By good destiny,
        this union comes about; this body enjoys its pleasures. Those
        who have lost their destiny, suffer separation from this union.
        O Nanak, they may still be united once again!  || 4 || 1 ||  
        MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  The union of the mother and father brings
        the body into being. The Creator inscribes upon it the inscription
        of its destiny. According to this inscription, gifts, light and
        glorious greatness are received. Joining with Maya, the spiritual
        consciousness is lost.  || 1 ||   O foolish mind, why are you
        so proud? You shall have to arise and depart when it pleases your
        Lord and Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Abandon the tastes of the
        world, and find intuitive peace. All must abandon their worldly
        homes; no one remains here forever. Eat some, and save the rest,
        if you are destined to return to the world again.  || 2 ||   He
        adorns his body and ress in silk robes. He issues all sorts of
        commands. Preparing his comfortable bed, he sleeps. When he falls
        into the hands of the Messenger of Death, what good does it do
        to cry out?  || 3 || <br>

      <p> Household affairs are whirlpools of entanglements, O Siblings
        of Destiny. Sin is a stone which does not float. So let the Fear
        of God be the boat to carry your soul across. Says Nanak, rare
        are those who are blessed with this Boat.  || 4 || 2 ||   MARU,
        FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:  Actions are the paper, and the mind
        is the ink; good and bad are both recorded upon it. As their past
        actions drive them, so are mortals driven. There is no end to
        Your Glorious Virtues, Lord.  || 1 ||   Why do you not keep Him
        in your consciousness, you mad man? Forgetting the Lord, your
        own virtues shall rot away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Th enight is
        a net, and the day is a net; there are as many traps as there
        are moments. With relish and delight, you continually bite at
        the bait; you are trapped, you fool - how will you ever
        escape?  || 2 ||   The body is a furnace, and the mind is the
        iron within it; the five fires are heating it. Sin is the charcoal
        placed upon it, which burns the mind; the tongs are anxiety and
        worry.  || 3 ||   What was turned to slag is again transformed
        into gold, if one meets with the Guru. He blesses the mortal with
        the Ambrosial Name of the One Lord, and then, O Nanak, the body
        is held steady.  || 4 || 3 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  In the pure,
        immaculate waters, both the lotus and the slimy scum are found.
        The lotus flower is with the scum and the water, but it remains
        untouched by any pollution.  || 1 ||   You frog, you will never
        understand. You eat the dirt, while you dwell in the immaculate
        waters. You know nothing of the ambrosial nectar there.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   You dwell continually in the water; the bumble
        bee does not dwell there, but it is intoxicated with its fragrance
        from afar. Intuitively sensing the moon in the distance, the lotus
        bows its head.  || 2 ||   The realms of nectar are irrigated with
        milk and honey; you think you are clever to live in the water.
        You can never escape your own inner tendencies, like the love
        of the flea for blood.  || 3 ||   The fool may live with the Pandit,
        the religious scholar, and listen to the Vedas and the Shaastras.
        You can never escape your own inner tendencies, like the crooked
        tail of the dog.  || 4 ||   Some are hypocrites; they do not merge
        with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Some are absorbed in the
        Feet of the Lord, Har, Har. The mortals obtain what they are predestined
        to receive; O Nanak, with your tongue, chant the Naam.  || 5 ||
        4 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL,  SHALOK:  Countless sinners are sanctified,
        attaching their minds to the Feet of the Lord. The merits of the
        sixty-eight places of pilgrimage are found in God's Name,
        O Nanak, when such destiny is inscribed upon one's forehead.
        || 1 ||   SHABAD:  O friends and companions, so puffed up with
        pride, listen to this one joyous story of your Husband Lord. 
        || 1 ||   Who can I tell about my pain, O my mother? Without the
        Lord, my soul cannot survive; how can I comfort it, O my mother?
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am a dejected, discarded bride, totally
        miserable. I have lost my youth; I regret and repent.  || 2 ||
        You are my wise Lord and Master, above my head. I serve You
        as Your humble slave. Nanak humbly prays, this is my only concern:
        without the Blessed Vision of my Beloved, how can I enjoy Him?

      <p> MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  I am Your slave, Your bonded servant, and
        so I am called fortunate. I sold myself at Your store in exchange
        for the Guru's Word; whatever You link me to, to that I
        am linked.  || 1 ||   What cleverness can Your servant try with
        You? O my Lord and Master, I cannot carry out the Hukam of Your
        Command.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My mother is Your slave, and my
        father is Your slave; I am the child of Your slaves. My slave
        mother dances, and my slave father sings; I practice devotional
        worship to You, O my Sovereign Lord.  || 2 ||   If You wish to
        drink, then I shall get water for You; if You wish to eat, I shall
        grind the corn for You. I wave the fan over You, and wash Your
        feet, and continue to chant Your Name.  || 3 ||   I have been
        untrue to myself, but Nanak is Your slave; please forgive him,
        by Your glorious greatness. Since the very beginning of time,
        and throughout the ages, You have been the merciful and generous
        Lord. Without You, liberation cannot be attained.  || 4 || 6 ||
        MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  Some call him a ghost; some say that he
        is a demon. Some call him a mere mortal; O, poor Nanak!  || 1
        ||   Crazy Nanak has gone insane, after his Lord, the King. I
        know of none other than the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He alone
        is known to be insane, when he goes insane with the Fear of God.
        He recognizes none other than the One Lord and Master.  || 2 ||
        He alone is known to be insane, if he works for the One Lord.
        Recognizing the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master, what
        other cleverness is there?  || 3 ||   He alone is known to be
        insane, when he falls in love with his Lord and Master. He sees
        himself as bad, and all the rest of the world as good.  || 4 ||
        7 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  This wealth is all-pervading, permeating
        all. The self-willed manmukh wanders around, thinking that it
        is far away.  || 1 ||   That commodity, the wealth of the Naam,
        is within my heart. Whoever You bless with it, is emancipated.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This wealth does not burn; it cannot be
        stolen by a thief. This wealth does not drown, and its owner is
        never punished.  || 2 ||   Gaze upon the glorious greatness of
        this wealth, and your nights and days will pass, imbued with celestial
        peace.  || 3 ||   Listen to this incomparably beautiful story,
        O my brothers, O Siblings of Destiny. Tell me, without this wealth,
        who has ever obtained the supreme status?  || 4 ||   Nanak humbly
        prays, I proclaim the Unspoken Speech of the Lord. If one meets
        the True Guru, then this wealth is obtained.  || 5 || 8 ||   MARU,
        FIRST MEHL:  Heat up the sun energy of the right nostril, and
        cool down the moon energy of the left nostril; practicing this
        breath-control, bring them into perfect balance. In this way,
        the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul
        shall not fly away, and the body-wall will not crumble.  || 1
        ||   You fool, why are you deluded by doubt? You do not remember
        the detached Lord of supreme bliss.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Seize
        and burn the unbearable; seize and kill the imperishable; leave
        behind your doubts, and then, you shall drink in the Nectar. In
        this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the
        swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall shall not crumble.
        || 2 ||   Nanak humbly prays, if the Lord's humble servant
        dwells upon Him, in his mind of minds, with his every breath,
        then he drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. <br>

      <p> In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady;
        the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall shall not
        crumble.  || 3 || 9 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  Maya is not conquered,
        and the mind is not subdued; the waves of desire in the world-ocean
        are intoxicating wine. The boat crosses over the water, carrying
        the true merchandise. The jewel within the mind subdues the mind;
        attached to the Truth, it is not broken. The king is seated upon
        the throne, imbued with the Fear of God and the five qualities.
        || 1 ||   O Baba, do not see your True Lord and Master as being
        far away. He is the Light of all, the Life of the world; The True
        Lord writes His Inscription on each and every head.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Brahma and Vishnu, the Rishis and the silent sages,
        Shiva and Indra, penitents and beggars - whoever obeys
        the Hukam of the Lord's Command, looks beautiful in the
        Court of the True Lord, while the stubborn rebels die. The wandering
        beggars, warriors, celibates and Sannyaasee hermits - through
        the Perfect Guru, consider this: without selfless service, no
        one ever receives the fruits of their rewards. Serving the Lord
        is the most excellent action.  || 2 ||   You are the wealth of
        the poor, the Guru of the guru-less, the honor of the dishonored.
        I am blind; I have grasped hold of the jewel, the Guru. You are
        the strength of the weak. He is not known through burnt offerings
        and ritual chanting; the True Lord is known through the Guru's
        Teachings. Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one finds
        shelter in the Court of the Lord; the false come and go in reincarnation.
        || 3 ||   So praise the True Name, and through the True Name,
        you will find satisfaction. When the mind is cleaned with the
        jewel of spiritual wisdom, it does not become dirty again. As
        long as the Lord and Master dwells in the mind, no obstacles are
        encountered. O Nanak, giving one's head, one is emancipated,
        and the mind and body become true.  || 4 || 10 ||   MARU,  FIRST
        MEHL:  The Yogi who is joined to the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is pure; he is not stained by even a particle of dirt. The True
        Lord, his Beloved, is always with him; the rounds of birth and
        death are ended for him.  || 1 ||   O Lord of the Universe, what
        is Your Name, and what is it like? If You summon me into the Mansion
        of Your Presence, I will ask You, how I can become one with You.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He alone is a Brahmin, who takes his cleansing
        bath in the spiritual wisdom of God, and whose leaf-offerings
        in worship are the Glorious Praises of the Lord. The One Name,
        the One Lord, and His One Light pervade the three worlds.  ||
        2 ||   My tongue is the balance of the scale, and this heart of
        mine is the pan of the scale; I weigh the immeasurable Naam. There
        is one store, and one banker above all; the merchants deal in
        the one commodity.  || 3 ||   The True Guru saves us at both ends;
        he alone understands, who is lovingly focused on the One Lord;
        his inner being remains free of doubt. The Word of the Shabad
        abides within, and doubt is ended, for those who constantly serve,
        day and night.  || 4 ||   Above is the sky of the mind, and beyond
        this sky is the Lord, the Protector of the World; the Inaccessible
        Lord God; the Guru abides there as well. According to the Word
        of the Guru's Teachings, what is outside is the same as
        what is inside the home of the self. Nanak has become a detached
        renunciate.  || 5 || 11 || <br>

        pain of separation from God. My body is pierced through with the
        arrow of love. How can any physician know the cure?  || 1 || 
        Rare is that one, who as Gurmukh, understands, and whom the True
        Lord links to His Praise. He alone appreciates the value of the
        Ambsosial Nectar, who deals in this Ambrosia.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The soul-bride is in love with her Husband Lord; the focuses
        her consciousness on the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The
        soul-bride is joyously embellished with intuitive ease; her hunger
        and thirst are taken away.  || 2 ||   Tear down skepticism and
        dispel your doubt; with your intuition, draw the bow of the Praise
        of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, conquer
        and subdue your mind; take the support of Yoga - Union
        with the beautiful Lord.  || 3 ||   Burnt by egotism, one forgets
        the Lord from his mind. In the City of Death, he is attacked with
        massive swords. Then, even if he asks for it, he will not receive
        the Lord's Name; O soul, you shall suffer terrible punishment.
        || 4 ||   You are distracted by thoughts of Maya and worldly
        attachment. In the City of Death, you will be caught by the noose
        of the Messenger of Death. You cannot break free from the bondage
        of loving attachment, and so the Messenger of Death will torture
        you.  || 5 ||   I have done nothing; I am doing nothing now. The
        True Guru has blessed me with the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam.
        What other efforts can anyone make, when You bestow Your blessing?

        the true commodity.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All serve the One True
        Lord; through pre-ordained destiny, they meet Him. The Gurmukhs
        merge with Him, and will not be separated from Him again; they
        attain the True Lord.  || 2 ||   Some do not appreciate the value
        of devotional worship; the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by
        doubt. They are fillled with self-conceit; they cannot accomplish
        anything.  || 3 ||   Stand and offer your prayer, to the One who
        cannot be moved by force. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        abides within the mind of the Gurmukh; hearing his prayer, the
        Lord applauds him.  || 4 || 4 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  He transforms
        the burning desert into a cool oasis; he transmutes rusted iron
        into gold. So praise the True Lord; there is none other as great
        as He is.  || 1 ||   O my mind, night and day, meditate on the
        Lord's Name. Contemplate the Word of the Guru's
        Teachings, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and
        day.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As Gurmukh, one comes to know the One
        Lord, when the True Guru instructs him. Praise the True Guru,
        who imparts this understanding.  || 2 ||   Those who forsake the
        True Guru, and attach themselves to duality - what will
        they do when they go to the world hereafter? Bound and gagged
        in the City of Death, they will be beaten. <br>

        following the Guru's Teachings, they sought the Sanctuary
        of the Lord, Har, Har. God met Sudama and removed his poverty;
        through loving devotional worship, he crossed over. God is the

        showers His Mercy on the Gurmukhs.  || 1 ||   O my mind, chanting
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you will be saved. Dhroo, Prahlaad
        and Bidar the slave-girl's son, became Gurmukh, and through
        the Naam, crossed over.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In this Dark Age
        of Kali Yuga, the Naam is the supreme wealth; it saves the humble
        devotees. All the faults of Naam Dayv, Jai Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan
        and Ravi Daas the leather-worker were covered. Those who become
        Gurmukh, and remain attached to the Naam, are saved; all their
        sinful residues are washed off.  || 2 ||   Whoever chants the
        Naam, all his sins and mistakes are taken away. Ajaamal, who had
        sex with prostitites, was saved, by chanting the Name of the Lord.
        Chanting the Naam, Ugar Sain obtained salvation; his bonds were
        broken, and he was liberated.  || 3 ||   God Himself takes pity
        on His humble servants, and makes them His own. My Lord of the
        Universe saves the honor of His servants; those who seek His Sanctuary
        are saved. The Lord has showered servant Nanak with His Mercy;
        he has enshrined the Lord's Name within his heart.  ||
        4 || 1 ||   MARU,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Siddhas in Samaadhi meditate
        on Him; they are lovingly focused on Him. The seekers and the
        silent sages meditate on Him as well. The celibates, the true
        and contented beings meditate on Him; Indra and the other gods
        chant His Name with their mouths. Those who seek His Sanctuary
        meditate on Him; they become Gurmukh and swim across.  || 1 ||
        O my mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and cross over.
        Dhanna the farmer, and Balmik the highway robber, became Gurmukh,
        and crossed over.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Angels, men, heavenly
        heralds and celestial singers meditate on Him; even the humble
        Rishis sing of the Lord. Shiva, Brahma and the goddess Lakhshmi,
        meditate, and chant with their mouths the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har. Those whose minds are drenched with the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, as Gurmukh, cross over.  || 2 ||   Millions and millions,
        thirty-three million gods meditate on Him; there is no end to
        those who meditate on the Lord. The Vedas, the Puraanas and the
        Simritees meditate on the Lord; the Pandits, the religious scholars,
        sing the Lord's Praises as well. Those whose minds are
        filled with the Naam, the source of nectar - as Gurmukh,
        they cross over.  || 3 ||   Those who chant the Naam in endless
        waves - I cannot even count their number. The Lord of the
        Universe bestows His Mercy, and those who are pleasing to the
        Mind of the Lord God, find their place. The Guru, granting His
        Grace, implants the Lord's Name within; servant Nanak chants
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 2 || <br>

        O Lord, Life of the World, please shower me with Your Mercy; grant
        me the Sanctuary of the Guru, the True Guru. The Dear Lord, becoming

        make myself a sacrifice to that one who leads me to meet my Lord
        God. I am filled with the Love of my Beloved; how can I meet my
        Friend, and merge with Him?  || 1 ||   O my beloved friend, my
        mind, I take the wealth, the capital of the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har. The Perfect Guru has implanted the Naam within me; the
        Lord is my support - I celebrate the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   O my Guru, please unite me with the Lord, Har, Har; show
        me the wealth, the capital of the Lord. Without the Guru, love
        does not well up; see this, and know it in your mind. The Lord
        has installed Himself within the Guru; so praise the Guru, who
        unites us with the Lord.  || 2 ||   The ocean, the treasure of
        devotional worship of the Lord, rests with the Perfect True Guru.
        When it pleases the True Guru, He opens the treasure, and and
        the Gurmukhs are illuminated by the Lord's Light. The unfortunate
        self-willed manmukhs die of thirst, on the very bank of the river.
        || 3 ||   The Guru is the Great Giver; I beg for this gift from
        the Guru, that He may unite me with God, from whom I was separated

        God is enshrined within the Sangat, the Holy Congregation. The

        of the Lord, their life is cursed; the manmukhs are stuck in manure.
        They come and go, and are consigned to wander through uncounted
        incarnations, eating stinking rot.  || 3 ||   Begging, imploring,
        I seek Your Sanctuary; Lord, shower me with Your Mercy, and save
        me, God. Lead me to join the Society of the Saints, and bless
        me with the honor and glory of the Lord's Name. I have
        obtained the wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; servant

        Har, one is carried across.  || 4 ||   You are everywhere; all
        are Yours. Whatever You do, God, that alone comes to pass. Poor
        servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; as it pleases
        the Lord, He bestows His approval.  || 5 || 1 || 7 ||   MARU,
        FOURTH MEHL:  Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind.
        The Lord shall eradicate all your sinful residues. Treasure the
        Lord's wealth, and gather in the Lord's wealth;
        when you depart in the end, the Lord shall go along with you as
        your only friend and companion.  || 1 ||   He alone meditates
        on the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace. He continually chants
        the Lord's Chant; meditating on the Lord, one finds peace.
        By Guru's Grace, the sublime essence of the Lord is obtained.
        Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, one is carried across.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The fearless, formless Lord - the Name
        is Truth. To chant it is the most sublime and exalted activity
        in this world. Doing so, the Messenger of Death, the evil enemy,
        is killed. Death does not even approach the Lord's servant.
        || 2 ||   One whose mind is satisfied with the Lord -
        that servant is known throughout the four ages, in all four directions.
        If some sinner speaks evil of him, the Messenger of Death chews
        him up.  || 3 ||   The One Pure Creator Lord is in all. He stages
        all His wondrous plays, and watches them. Who can kill that person,
        whom the Lord has saved? The Creator Lord Himself delivers him.
        || 4 ||   I chant the Name of the Creator Lord, night and day.
        He saves all His servants and devotees. Consult the eighteen Puraanas
        and the four Vedas; O servant Nanak, only the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, will deliver you.  || 5 || 2 || 8 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The earth, the Akaashic ethers and the stars
        abide in the Fear of God. The almighty Order of the Lord is over
        the heads of all. Wind, water and fire abide in the Fear of God;
        poor Indra abides in the Fear of God as well.  || 1 ||   I have
        heard one thing, that the One Lord alone is fearless. He alone
        is at peace, and he alone is embellished forever, who meets with
        the Guru, and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The embodied and the divine beings abide in the Fear
        of God. The Siddhas and seekers die in the Fear of God. The 8.4
        millions species of beings die, and die again, and are born over
        and over again. <br>

      <p> They are consigned to reincarnation.  || 2 ||   Those who embody
        the energies of sattva-white light, raajas-red passion,
        and taamas-black darkness, abide in the Fear of God, along
        with the many created forms. This miserable deceiver Maya abides
        in the Fear of God; the Righteous Judge of Dharma is utterly afraid
        of Him as well. The entire expanse of the Universe is in the Fear
        of God; only the Creator Lord is without this Fear. Says Nanak,
        God is the companion of His devotees; His devotees look beautiful
        in the Court of the Lord.  || 4 || 1 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        The five year old orphan boy Dhroo, by meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord, became stationary and permanent. For the sake of
        his son, Ajaamal called out, &quot;O Lord, Naaraayan&quot;,
        who struck down and killed the Messenger of Death.  || 1 ||  
        My Lord and Master has saved many, countless beings. I am meek,
        with little or no understanding, and unworthy; I seek protection
        at the Lord's Door.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Baalmeek the
        outcaste was saved, and the poor hunter was saved as well. The
        elephant remembered the Lord in his mind for an instant, and so
        was carried across.  || 2 ||   He saved His devotee Prahlaad,
        and tore Harnaakhash with his nails. Bidar, the son of a slave-girl,
        was purified, and all his generations were redeemed.  || 3 ||
        What sins of mine should I speak of? I am intoxicated with false
        emotional attachment. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord;
        please, reach out and take me into Your embrace.  || 4 || 2 ||
        MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  For the sake of riches, I wandered around
        in so many ways; I rushed around, making all sorts of efforts.
        The deeds I did in egotism and pride, have all been done in vain.
        || 1 ||   Other days are of no use to me; please bless me with
        those days, O Dear God, on which I may sing the Lord's
        Praises.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Gazing upon children, spouse, household
        and possessions, one is entangled in these. Tasting the wine of
        Maya, one is intoxicated, and never sings of the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 2 ||   In this way, I have examined lots of methods, but without
        the Saints, it is not found. You are the Great Giver, the great
        and almighty God; I have come to beg a gift from You.  || 3 ||
        Abandoning all pride and self-importance, I have sought the
        Sanctuary of the dust of the feet of the Lord's slave.
        Says Nanak, meeting with the Lord, I have become one with Him;
        I have found supreme bliss and peace.  || 4 || 3 ||   MARU,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  In what place is the Name established? Where does egotism
        dwell? What injury have you suffered, listening to abuse from
        someone else's mouth?  || 1 ||   Listen: who are you, and
        where did you come from? You don't even know how long you
        will stay here; you have no hint of when you shall leave.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Wind and water have patience and tolerance;
        the earth has compassion and forgiveness, no doubt. The union
        of the five tattvas - the five elements - has brought
        you into being. Which of these is evil?  || 2 ||   The Primal
        Lord, the Architect of Destiny, formed your form; He also burdened
        you with egotism. He alone is born and dies; He alone comes and
        goes.  || 3 ||   Nothing of the color and the form of the creation
        shall remain; the entire expanse is transitory. <br>
