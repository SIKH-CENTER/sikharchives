      <p> The One Lord of the Universe is the Support of His humble servants.
        They love the One Lord; their minds are filled with love for the
        Lord. The Name of the Lord is all treasures for them.  || 3 ||
        They are in love with the Supreme Lord God; their actions are
        pure, and their lifestyle is true. The Perfect Guru has dispelled
        the darkness. Nanak's God is Incomparable and Infinite. 
        || 4 || 24 || 93 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those whose
        minds are filled with the Lord, swim across. Those who have the
        blessing of good karma, meet with the Lord. Pain, disease and
        fear do not affect them at all. They meditate on the Ambrosial
        Name of the Lord within their hearts.  || 1 ||   Meditate on the
        Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord. From the Perfect Guru,
        this understanding is obtained.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Merciful
        Lord is the Doer, the Cause of causes. He cherishes and nurtures
        all beings and creatures. He is Inaccessible, Incomprehensible,
        Eternal and Infinite. Meditate on Him, O my mind, through the
        Teachings of the Perfect Guru.  || 2 ||   Serving Him, all treasures
        are obtained. Worshipping God, honor is obtained. Working for
        Him is never in vain; forever and ever, sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Show Mercy to me, O God, O Searcher of
        hearts. The Unseen Lord and Master is the Treasure of Peace. All
        beings and creatures seek Your Sanctuary; Nanak is blessed to
        receive the greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4
        || 25 || 94 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Our way of life
        is in His Hands; remember Him, the Master of the masterless. When
        God comes to mind, all pains depart. All fears are dispelled through
        the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Why do you fear any other than
        the Lord? Forgetting the Lord, why do you pretend to be at peace?
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He established the many worlds and skies.
        The soul is illumined with His Light; no one can revoke His Blessing.
        Meditate, meditate in remembrance on God, and become fearless.
        || 2 ||   Twenty-four hours a day, meditate in remembrance on
        God's Name. In it are the many sacred shrines of pilgrimage
        and cleansing baths. Seek the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God.
        Millions of mistakes shall be erased in an instant.  || 3 || 
        The Perfect King is self-sufficient. God's servant has true
        faith in Him. Giving him His Hand, the Perfect Guru protects him.
        O Nanak, the Supreme Lord God is All-powerful.  || 4 || 26 ||
        95 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  By Guru's Grace,
        my mind is attached to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Asleep
        for so many incarnations, it is now awakened. I chant the Ambrosial
        Bani, the Glorious Praises of God. The Pure Teachings of the Perfect
        Guru have been revealed to me.  || 1 ||   Meditating in remembrance
        on God, I have found total peace. Within my home, and outside
        as well, there is peace and poise all around.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I have recognized the One who created me. Showing His Mercy,
        God has blended me with Himself. Taking me by the arm, He has
        made me His Own. I continually chant and meditate on the Sermon
        of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 2 ||   Mantras, tantras, all-curing
        medicines and acts of atonement, are all in the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, the Support of the soul and the breath of life. </p>

      </p>
      <p> I have obtained the true wealth of the Lord's Love. I have
        crossed over the treacherous world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy.  || 3 ||   Sit in peace, O Saints, with
        the family of friends. Earn the wealth of the Lord, which is beyond
        estimation. He alone obtains it, unto whom the Guru has bestowed
        it. O Nanak, no one shall go away empty-handed.  || 4 || 27 ||
        96 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The hands are sanctified
        instantly, and the entanglements of Maya are dispelled. Repeat
        constantly with your tongue the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        and you shall find peace, O my friends, O Siblings of Destiny.
        || 1 ||   With pen and ink, write upon your paper the Name of
        the Lord, the Ambrosial Word of the Lord's Bani.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   By this act, your sins shall be washed away. Remembering
        the Lord in meditation, you shall not be punished by the Messenger
        of Death. The couriers of the Righteous Judge of Dharma shall
        not touch you. The intoxication of Maya shall not entice you at
        all.  || 2 ||   You shall be redeemed, and through you, the whole
        world shall be saved, if you chant the Name of the One and Only
        Lord. Practice this yourself, and teach others; instill the Lord's
        Name in your heart.  || 3 ||   That person, who has this treasure
        upon his forehead  -  that person meditates on God. Twenty-four
        hours a day, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.
        Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to Him.  || 4 || 28 || 97 || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <center>
        RAAG GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL,  CHAU-PADAS,  DU-PADAS:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> That which belongs to another  -  he claims as his own. That
        which he must abandon  -  to that, his mind is attracted. 
        || 1 ||   Tell me, how can he meet the Lord of the World? That
        which is forbidden  -  with that, he is in love.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   That which is false  -  he deems as true. That
        which is true  -  his mind is not attached to that at all.
        || 2 ||   He takes the crooked path of the unrighteous way; leaving
        the straight and narrow path, he weaves his way backwards.  ||
        3 ||   God is the Lord and Master of both worlds. He, whom the
        Lord unites with Himself, O Nanak, is liberated.  || 4 || 29 ||
        98 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the Dark Age of Kali
        Yuga, they come together through destiny. As long as the Lord
        commands, they enjoy their pleasures.  || 1 ||   By burning oneself,
        the Beloved Lord is not obtained. Only by the actions of destiny
        does she rise up and burn herself, as a 'satee'.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Imitating what she sees, with her stubborn mind-set,
        she goes into the fire. She does not obtain the Company of her
        Beloved Lord, and she wanders through countless incarnations.
        || 2 ||   With pure conduct and self-restraint, she surrenders
        to her Husband Lord's Will; that woman shall not suffer pain
        at the hands of the Messenger of Death.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak,
        she who looks upon the Transcendent Lord as her Husband, is the
        blessed 'satee'; she is received with honor in the Court
        of the Lord.  || 4 || 30 || 99 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  I am prosperous and fortunate, for I have received the
        True Name. </p>

      <p> I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, with natural, intuitive
        ease.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When I opened it up and gazed upon
        the treasures of my father and grandfather, then my mind became
        very happy.  || 1 ||   The storehouse is inexhaustible and immeasurable,
        overflowing with priceless jewels and rubies.  || 2 ||   The Siblings
        of Destiny meet together, and eat and spend, but these resources
        do not diminish; they continue to increase.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak,
        one who has such destiny written on his forehead, becomes a partner
        in these treasures.  || 4 || 31 || 100 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        I was scared, scared to death, when I thought that He was far
        away. But my fear was removed, when I saw that He is pervading
        everywhere.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to my True Guru. He shall
        not abandon me; He shall surely carry me across.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Pain, disease and sorrow come when one forgets the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Eternal bliss comes when one sings the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord.  || 2 ||   Do not say that anyone is good
        or bad. Renounce your arrogant pride, and grasp the Feet of the
        Lord.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, remember the GurMantra; you shall
        find peace at the True Court.  || 4 || 32 || 101 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Those who have the Lord as their Friend and Companion
        -  tell me, what else do they need?  || 1 ||   Those who are
        in love with the Lord of the Universe  -  pain, suffering and
        doubt run away from them.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who have
        enjoyed the flavor of the Lord's sublime essence are not
        attracted to any other pleasures.  || 2 ||   Those whose speech
        is accepted in the Court of the Lord  -  what do they care
        about anything else?  || 3 ||   Those who belong to the One, unto
        whom all things belong  -  O Nanak, they find a lasting peace.
        || 4 || 33 || 102 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those who look alike
        upon pleasure and pain  -  how can anxiety touch them?  ||
        1 ||   The Lord's Holy Saints abide in celestial bliss. They
        remain obedient to the Lord, the Sovereign Lord King.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Those who have the Carefree Lord abiding in their
        minds  -  no cares will ever bother them.  || 2 ||   Those
        who have banished doubt from their minds are not afraid of death
        at all.  || 3 ||   Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord's
        Name by the Guru  -  says Nanak, all treasures come to them.
        || 4 || 34 || 103 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord of Unfathomable
        Form has His Place in the mind. By Guru's Grace, a rare few
        come to understand this.  || 1 ||   The Ambrosial Pools of the
        celestial sermon  -  those who find them, drink them in.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The unstruck melody of the Guru's Bani
        vibrates in that most special place. The Lord of the World is
        fascinated with this melody.  || 2 ||   The numerous, countless
        places of celestial peace  -  there, the Saints dwell, in the
        Company of the Supreme Lord God.  || 3 ||   There is infinite
        joy, and no sorrow or duality. The Guru has blessed Nanak with
        this home.  || 4 || 35 || 104 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  What
        form of Yours should I worship and adore? What Yoga should I practice
        to control my body?  || 1 || </p>
      <p>

      <p> What is that virtue, by which I may sing of You? What is that
        speech, by which I may please the Supreme Lord God?  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   What worship service shall I perform for You? How
        can I cross over the terrifying world-ocean?  || 2 ||   What is
        that penance, by which I may become a penitent? What is that Name,
        by which the filth of egotism may be washed away?  || 3 ||   Virtue,
        worship, spiritual wisdom, meditation and all service, O Nanak,
        are obtained from the True Guru, when, in His Mercy and Kindness,
        He meets us.  || 4 ||   They alone receive this merit, and they
        alone know God, who are approved by the Giver of peace.  || 1
        ||  Second Pause  || 36 || 105 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        body which you are so proud of, does not belong to you. Power,
        property and wealth are not yours.  || 1 ||   They are not yours,
        so why do you cling to them? Only the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is yours; it is received from the True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Children, spouse and siblings are not yours. Dear friends,
        mother and father are not yours.  || 2 ||   Gold, silver and money
        are not yours. Fine horses and magnificent elephants are of no
        use to you.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, those whom the Guru forgives,
        meet with the Lord. Everything belongs to those who have the Lord
        as their King.  || 4 || 37 || 106 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I
        place the Guru's Feet on my forehead, and all my pains are
        gone.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to my True Guru. I have come
        to understand my soul, and I enjoy supreme bliss.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I have applied the dust of the Guru's Feet to my face,
        which has removed all my arrogant intellect.  || 2 ||   The Word
        of the Guru's Shabad has become sweet to my mind, and I behold
        the Supreme Lord God.  || 3 ||   The Guru is the Giver of peace;
        the Guru is the Creator. O Nanak, the Guru is the Support of the
        breath of life and the soul.  || 4 || 38 || 107 ||   GAUREE, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  O my mind, seek the One who lacks nothing.  || 1
        ||   Make the Beloved Lord your friend. Keep Him constantly in
        your mind; He is the Support of the breath of life.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   O my mind, serve Him; He is the Primal Being, the
        Infinite Divine Lord.  || 2 ||   Place your hopes in the One who
        is the Support of all beings, from the very beginning of time,
        and throughout the ages.  || 3 ||   His Love brings eternal peace;
        meeting the Guru, Nanak sings His Glorious Praises.  || 4 || 39
        || 108 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Whatever my Friend does, I accept.
        My Friend's actions are pleasing to me.  || 1 ||   Within
        my conscious mind, the One Lord is my only Support. One who does
        this is my Friend.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My Friend is Carefree.
        By Guru's Grace, I give my love to Him.  || 2 ||   My Friend
        is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. He is the All-powerful
        Being, the Supreme Lord and Master.  || 3 || </p>

        and glory are Yours, God.  || 4 || 40 || 109 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Those who have You on their side, O All-powerful Lord  - 
        no black stain can stick to them.  || 1 ||   O Lord of wealth,
        those who place their hopes in You  -  nothing of the world
        can touch them at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those whose hearts
        are filled with their Lord and Master  -  no anxiety can affect
        them.  || 2 ||   Those, unto whom You give Your consolation, God
        -  pain does not even approach them.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak,
        I have found that Guru, who has shown me the Perfect, Supreme
        Lord God.  || 4 || 41 || 110 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  This human
        body is so difficult to obtain; it is only obtained by great good
        fortune. Those who do not meditate on the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, are murderers of the soul.  || 1 ||   Those who forget the
        Lord might just as well die. Without the Naam, of what use are
        their lives?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Eating, drinking, playing,
        laughing and showing off  -  what use are the ostentatious
        displays of the dead?  || 2 ||   Those who do not listen to the
        Praises of the Lord of supreme bliss, are worse off than beasts,
        birds or creeping creatures.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, the GurMantra
        has been implanted within me; the Name alone is contained within
        my heart.  || 4 || 42 || 111 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Whose
        mother is this? Whose father is this? They are relatives in name
        only  -  they are all false.  || 1 ||   Why are you screaming
        and shouting, you fool? By good destiny and the Lord's Order,
        you have come into the world.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There is the
        one dust, the one light, the one praanic wind. Why are you crying?
        For whom do you cry?  || 2 ||   People weep and cry out, &quot;Mine,
        mine!&quot; This soul is not perishable.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak,
        the Guru has opened my shutters; I am liberated, and my doubts
        have been dispelled.  || 4 || 43 || 112 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Those who seem to be great and powerful, are afflicted by the
        disease of anxiety.  || 1 ||   Who is great by the greatness of
        Maya? They alone are great, who are lovingly attached to the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The landlord fights over his land each day.
        He shall have to leave it in the end, and yet his desire is still
        not satisfied.  || 2 ||   Says Nanak, this is the essence of Truth:
        without the Lord's meditation, there is no salvation.  ||
        3 || 44 || 113 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Perfect is the path;
        perfect is the cleansing bath. Everything is perfect, if the Naam
        is in the heart.  || 1 ||   One's honor remains perfect,
        when the Perfect Lord preserves it. His servant takes to the Sanctuary
        of the Supreme Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Perfect is the
        peace; perfect is the contentment. Perfect is the penance; perfect
        is the Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success.  || 2 ||
        On the Lord's Path, sinners are purified. Perfect is their
        glory; perfect is their humanity.  || 3 ||   They dwell forever
        in the Presence of the Creator Lord. Says Nanak, my True Guru
        is Perfect.  || 4 || 45 || 114 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Millions
        of sins are wiped away by the dust of the feet of the Saints. </p>

      <p> By the Grace of the Saints, one is released from birth and death.
        || 1 ||   The Blessed Vision of the Saints is the perfect cleansing
        bath. By the Grace of the Saints, one comes to chant the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Society of
        the Saints, egotism is shed, and the One Lord is seen everywhere.
        || 2 ||   By the pleasure of the Saints, the five passions are
        overpowered, and the heart is irrigated with the Ambrosial Naam.
        || 3 ||   Says Nanak, one whose karma is perfect, touches the
        feet of the Holy.  || 4 || 46 || 115 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Meditating on the Glories of the Lord, the heart-lotus blossoms
        radiantly. Remembering the Lord in meditation, all fears are dispelled.
        || 1 ||   Perfect is that intellect, by which the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord are sung. By great good fortune, one finds the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the
        Saadh Sangat, the treasure of the Name is obtained. In the Saadh
        Sangat, all one's works are brought to fruition.  || 2 ||
        Through devotion to the Lord, one's life is approved. By
        Guru's Grace, one chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 3 ||   Says Nanak, that humble being is accepted, within whose
        heart the Lord God abides.  || 4 || 47 || 116 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Those whose minds are imbued with the One Lord, forget
        to feel jealous of others.  || 1 ||   They see none other than
        the Lord of the Universe. The Creator is the Doer, the Cause of
        causes.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who work willingly, and chant
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har  -  they do not waver, here
        or hereafter.  || 2 ||   Those who possess the wealth of the Lord
        are the true bankers. The Perfect Guru has established their line
        of credit.  || 3 ||   The Giver of life, the Sovereign Lord King
        meets them. Says Nanak, they attain the supreme status.  || 4
        || 48 || 117 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, is the Support of the breath of life of His devotees.
        The Naam is their wealth, the Naam is their occupation.  || 1
        ||   By the greatness of the Naam, His humble servants are blessed
        with glory. The Lord Himself bestows it, in His Mercy.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The Naam is the home of peace of His devotees. Attuned
        to the Naam, His devotees are approved.  || 2 ||   The Name of
        the Lord is the support of His humble servants. With each and
        every breath, they remember the Naam.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, those
        who have perfect destiny  -  their minds are attached to the
        Naam.  || 4 || 49 || 118 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  By the Grace
        of the Saints, I meditated on the Name of the Lord. Since then,
        my restless mind has been satisfied.  || 1 ||   I have obtained
        the home of peace, singing His Glorious Praises. My troubles have
        ended, and the demon has been destroyed.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        Worship and adore the Lotus Feet of the Lord God. Meditating
        in remembrance on the Lord, my anxiety has come to an end.  ||
        2 ||   I have renounced all  -  I am an orphan. I have come
        to the Sanctuary of the One Lord. Since then, I have found the
        highest celestial home.  || 3 ||   My pains, troubles, doubts
        and fears are gone. The Creator Lord abides in Nanak's mind.
        || 4 || 50 || 119 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  With my hands I
        do His work; with my tongue I sing His Glorious Praises. </p>

      <p> With my feet, I walk on the Path of my Lord and Master.  || 1
        ||   It is a good time, when I remember Him in meditation. Meditating
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I cross over the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   With your eyes, behold the
        Blessed Vision of the Saints. Record the Immortal Lord God within
        your mind.  || 2 ||   Listen to the Kirtan of His Praises, at
        the Feet of the Holy. Your fears of birth and death shall depart.
        || 3 ||   Enshrine the Lotus Feet of your Lord and Master within
        your heart. Thus this human life, so difficult to obtain, shall
        be redeemed.  || 4 || 51 || 120 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those,
        upon whom the Lord Himself showers His Mercy, chant the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, with their tongues.  || 1 ||   Forgetting
        the Lord, superstition and sorrow shall overtake you. Meditating
        on the Naam, doubt and fear shall depart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Listening to the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and singing
        the Lord's Kirtan, misfortune shall not even come near you.
        || 2 ||   Working for the Lord, His humble servants look beautiful.
        The fire of Maya does not touch them.  || 3 ||   Within their
        minds, bodies and mouths, is the Name of the Merciful Lord. Nanak
        has renounced other entanglements.  || 4 || 52 || 121 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Renounce your cleverness, and your cunning tricks.
        Seek the Support of the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||   Your pain shall
        depart, and in peace, you shall sing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord. Meeting the Perfect Guru, let yourself be absorbed in the
        Lord's Love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru has given me
        the Mantra of the Name of the Lord. My worries are forgotten,
        and my anxiety is gone.  || 2 ||   Meeting with the Merciful Guru,
        I am in ecstasy. Showering His Mercy, He has cut away the noose
        of the Messenger of Death.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, I have found
        the Perfect Guru; Maya shall no longer harass me.  || 4 || 53
        || 122 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Perfect Guru Himself has
        saved me. The self-willed manmukhs are afflicted with misfortune.
        || 1 ||   Chant and meditate on the Guru, the Guru, O my friend.
        Your face shall be radiant in the Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Enshrine the Feet of the Guru within your heart;
        your pains, enemies and bad luck shall be destroyed.  || 2 ||
        The Word of the Guru's Shabad is your Companion and Helper.
        O Siblings of Destiny, all beings shall be kind to you.  || 3
        ||   When the Perfect Guru granted His Grace, says Nanak, I was
        totally, completely fulfilled.  || 4 || 54 || 123 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Like beasts, they consume all sorts of tasty treats.
        With the rope of emotional attachment, they are bound and gagged
        like thieves.  || 1 ||   Their bodies are corpses, without the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. They come and go in reincarnation,
        and are destroyed by pain.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They wear all
        sorts of beautiful robes, but they are still just scarecrows in
        the field, frightening away the birds.  || 2 ||   All bodies are
        of some use, but those who do not meditate on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, are totally useless.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, those
        unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful, join the Saadh Sangat, and
        meditate on the Lord of the Universe.  || 4 || 55 || 124 ||

      <p> The Word of the Guru's Shabad quiets worries and troubles.
        Coming and going ceases, and all comforts are obtained.  || 1
        ||   Fear is dispelled, meditating on the Fearless Lord. In the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I chant the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have enshrined the Lotus
        Feet of the Lord within my heart. The Guru has carried me across
        the ocean of fire.  || 2 ||   I was sinking down, and the Perfect
        Guru pulled me out. I was cut off from the Lord for countless
        incarnations, and now the Guru united me with Him again.  || 3
        ||   Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru; meeting Him, I
        have been saved.  || 4 || 56 || 125 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, seek His Sanctuary.
        Place your mind and body in offering before Him.  || 1 ||   Drink
        in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Name, O my Siblings of Destiny.
        Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the fire of
        desire is totally quenched.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Renounce your
        arrogant pride, and end the cycle of birth and death. Bow in humility
        to the feet of the Lord's slave.  || 2 ||   Remember God
        in your mind, with each and every breath. Gather only that wealth,
        which shall go with you.  || 3 ||   He alone obtains it, upon
        whose forehead such destiny is written. Says Nanak, fall at the
        Feet of that Lord.  || 4 || 57 || 126 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The dried branches are made green again in an instant. His Ambrosial
        Glance irrigates and revives them.  || 1 ||   The Perfect Divine
        Guru has removed my sorrow. He blesses His servant with His service.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Anxiety is removed, and the desires of the
        mind are fulfilled, when the True Guru, the Treasure of Excellence,
        shows His Kindness.  || 2 ||   Pain is driven far away, and peace
        comes in its place; there is no delay, when the Guru gives the
        Order.  || 3 ||   Desires are fulfilled, when one meets the True
        Guru; O Nanak, His humble servant is fruitful and prosperous.
        || 4 || 58 || 127 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The fever has departed;
        God has showered us with peace and tranquility. A cooling peace
        prevails; God has granted this gift.  || 1 ||   By God's
        Grace, we have become comfortable. Separated from Him for countless
        incarnations, we are now reunited with Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God's Name, the
        dwelling of all disease is destroyed.  || 2 ||   In intuitive
        peace and poise, chant the Word of the Lord's Bani. Twenty-four
        hours a day, O mortal, meditate on God.  || 3 ||   Pain, suffering
        and the Messenger of Death do not even approach that one, says
        Nanak, who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 4 || 59
        || 128 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Auspicious is the day, and auspicious
        is the chance, which brought me to the Supreme Lord God, the Unjoined,
        Unlimited One.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to that time, when
        my mind chants the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Blessed
        is that moment, and blessed is that time, when my tongue chants
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Haree.  || 2 ||   Blessed is that forehead,
        which bows in humility to the Saints. Sacred are those feet, which
        walk on the Lord's Path.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, auspicious
        is my karma, which has led me to touch the Feet of the Holy.

      <p> GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Keep the Word of the Guru's Shabad
        in your mind. Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, all anxiety is removed.  || 1 ||   Without the Lord
        God, there is no one else at all. He alone preserves and destroys.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Enshrine the Guru's Feet in your heart.
        Meditate on Him and cross over the ocean of fire.  || 2 ||   Focus
        your meditation on the Guru's Sublime Form. Here and hereafter,
        you shall be honored.  || 3 ||   Renouncing everything, I have
        come to the Guru's Sanctuary. My anxieties are over  - 
        O Nanak, I have found peace.  || 4 || 61 || 130 ||   GAUREE, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  Remembering Him in meditation, all pains are gone.
        The jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell in
        the mind.  || 1 ||   O my mind, chant the Bani, the Hymns of the
        Lord of the Universe. The Holy People chant the Lord's Name
        with their tongues.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without the One Lord,
        there is no other at all. By His Glance of Grace, eternal peace
        is obtained.  || 2 ||   Make the One Lord your friend, intimate
        and companion. Write in your mind the Word of the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 3 ||   The Lord Master is totally pervading everywhere. Nanak
        sings the Praises of the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
        || 4 || 62 || 131 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The whole world
        is engrossed in fear. Those who have the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, as their Support, feel no fear.  || 1 ||   Fear does not
        affect those who take to Your Sanctuary. You do whatever You please.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In pleasure and in pain, the world is coming
        and going in reincarnation. Those who are pleasing to God, find
        peace.  || 2 ||   Maya pervades the awesome ocean of fire. Those
        who have found the True Guru are calm and cool.  || 3 ||   Please
        preserve me, O God, O Great Preserver! Says Nanak, what a helpless
        creature I am!  || 4 || 63 || 132 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  By
        Your Grace, I chant Your Name. By Your Grace, I obtain a seat
        in Your Court.  || 1 ||   Without You, O Supreme Lord God, there
        is no one. By Your Grace, everlasting peace is obtained.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   If You abide in the mind, we do not suffer in
        sorrow. By Your Grace, doubt and fear run away.  || 2 ||   O Supreme
        Lord God, Infinite Lord and Master, You are the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of all hearts.  || 3 ||   I offer this prayer to
        the True Guru: O Nanak, may I be blessed with the treasure of
        the True Name.  || 4 || 64 || 133 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  As
        the husk is empty without the grain, so is the mouth empty without
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O mortal, chant continually
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Without the Naam, cursed is the
        body, which shall be taken back by Death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Without the Naam, no one's face shows good fortune. Without
        the Husband, where is the marriage?  || 2 ||   Forgetting the
        Naam, and attached to other tastes, no desires are fulfilled.
        || 3 ||   O God, grant Your Grace, and give me this gift. </p>

        the Searcher of hearts.  || 1 ||   The Perfect Supreme Lord God
        is the Support of His humble servant. Millions are saved in Your
        Sanctuary.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As many creatures as there are
        -  they are all Yours. By Your Grace, all sorts of comforts
        are obtained.  || 2 ||   Whatever happens, is all according to
        Your Will. One who understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command,
        is absorbed in the True Lord.  || 3 ||   Please grant Your Grace,

        the treasure of the Naam.  || 4 || 66 || 135 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan
        is obtained, by those who are lovingly absorbed in the Lord's
        Name.  || 1 ||   Those whose minds are filled with the Lord, do
        not suffer pain, even in dreams.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All treasures
        have been placed within the minds of His humble servants. In their
        company, sinful mistakes and sorrows are taken away.  || 2 ||
        The Glories of the Lord's humble servants cannot be described.
        The servants of the Supreme Lord God remain absorbed in Him. 
        || 3 ||   Grant Your Grace, God, and hear my prayer: please bless
        Nanak with the dust of the feet of Your slave.  || 4 || 67 ||
        136 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Remembering the Lord in meditation,
        your misfortune shall be taken away, and all joy shall come to
        abide in your mind.  || 1 ||   Meditate, O my mind, on the One
        Name. It alone shall be of use to your soul.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Night and day, sing the Glorious Praises of the Infinite
        Lord, through the Pure Mantra of the Perfect Guru.  || 2 ||  
        Give up other efforts, and place your faith in the Support of
        the One Lord. Taste the Ambrosial Essence of this, the greatest
        treasure.  || 3 ||   They alone cross over the treacherous world-ocean,
        O Nanak, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace.  || 4 ||
        68 || 137 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have enshrined the Lotus
        Feet of God within my heart. Meeting the Perfect True Guru, I
        am emancipated.  || 1 ||   Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
        of the Universe, O my Siblings of Destiny. Joining the Holy Saints,
        meditate on the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This human
        body, so difficult to obtain, is redeemed when one receives the
        banner of the Naam from the True Guru.  || 2 ||   Meditating in
        remembrance on the Lord, the state of perfection is attained.
        In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, fear and doubt depart.
        || 3 ||   Wherever I look, there I see the Lord pervading. Slave
        Nanak has entered the Lord's Sanctuary.  || 4 || 69 || 138

        of the True Guru, I live.  || 1 ||   O Supreme Lord God, O Perfect
        Divine Guru, show mercy to me, and commit me to Your service.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I enshrine His Lotus Feet within my heart.
        I offer my mind, body and wealth to the Guru, the Support of the
        breath of life.  || 2 ||   My life is prosperous, fruitful and
        approved; I know that the Guru, the Supreme Lord God, is near

        || 4 || 70 || 139 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  They do their evil
        deeds, and pretend otherwise; but in the Court of the Lord, they
        shall be bound and gagged like thieves.  || 1 ||   Those who remember
        the Lord belong to the Lord. The One Lord is contained in the
        water, the land and the sky.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Their inner
        beings are filled with poison, and yet with their mouths, they
        preach words of Ambrosial Nectar. Bound and gagged in the City
        of Death, they are punished and beaten.  || 2 ||   Hiding behind
        many screens, they commit acts of corruption, but in an instant,
        they are revealed to all the world.  || 3 ||   Those whose inner
        beings are true, who are attuned to the ambrosial essence of the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord  -  O Nanak, the Lord, the Architect

        1 ||   One whose mind is attuned to the Lord's Love is true.
        The Love of the Beloved, the Architect of Destiny, is perfect.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sitting in the Society of the Saints, sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. The color of His Love shall
        never fade away.  || 2 ||   Without meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord, peace is not found. All the other loves and tastes
        of Maya are bland and insipid.  || 3 ||   Those who are imbued
        with love by the Guru become happy. Says Nanak, the Guru has become
        merciful to them.  || 4 || 72 || 141 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Meditating in remembrance on the Lord Master, sinful mistakes
        are erased, and one comes to abide in peace, celestial joy and
        bliss.  || 1 ||   The Lord's humble servants place their
        faith in the Lord. Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all
        anxieties are dispelled.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, there is no fear or doubt. The Glorious
        Praises of the Lord are sung there, day and night.  || 2 ||  
        Granting His Grace, God has released me from bondage. He has given
        me the Support of His Lotus Feet.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, faith
        comes into the mind of His servant, who continually drinks in
        the Immaculate Praises of the Lord.  || 4 || 73 || 142 ||   GAUREE,
