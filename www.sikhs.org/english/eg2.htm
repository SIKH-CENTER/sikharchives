        <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD. </b>
        <p> <b>BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU: </b> </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> RAAG SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> If I had a palace made of pearls, inlaid with jewels, scented
        with musk, saffron and sandalwood, a sheer delight to behold - seeing
        this, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not
        enter into my mind.  || 1 ||   Without the Lord, my soul is scorched
        and burnt. I consulted my Guru, and now I see that there is no
        other place at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If the floor of this
        palace was a mosaic of diamonds and rubies, and if my bed was
        encased with rubies, and if heavenly beauties, their faces adorned
        with emeralds, tried to entice me with sensual gestures of love - seeing
        these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not
        enter into my mind.  || 2 ||   If I were to become a Siddha, and
        work miracles, summon wealth and become invisible and visible
        at will, so that people would hold me in awe - seeing these,
        I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter
        into my mind.  || 3 ||   If I were to become an emperor and raise
        a huge army, and sit on a throne, issuing commands and collecting
        taxes - O Nanak, all of this could pass away like a puff of
        wind. Seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your
        Name would not enter into my mind.  || 4 || 1 ||   SIREE RAAG,
        FIRST MEHL:  If I could live for millions and millions of years,
        and if the air was my food and drink, and if I lived in a cave
        and never saw either the sun or the moon, and if I never slept,
        even in dreams - even so, I could not estimate Your Value.
        How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name?  || 1 ||   The
        True Lord, the Formless One, is Himself in His Own Place. I have
        heard, over and over again, and so I tell the tale; as it pleases
        You, Lord, please instill within me the yearning for You.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   If I was slashed and cut into pieces, over and
        over again, and put into the mill and ground into flour, burnt
        by fire and mixed with ashes - even then, I could not estimate
        Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name?  ||
        2 ||   If I was a bird, soaring and flying through hundreds of
        heavens, and if I was invisible, neither eating nor drinking anything - even
        so, I could not estimate Your Value. </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name?  || 3 ||   O Nanak,
        if I had hundreds of thousands of stacks of paper, and if ink
        were never to fail me, and if my pen were able to move like the
        wind, and if I were to read and recite and embrace love for the
        Lord - even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I
        describe the Greatness of Your Name?  || 4 || 2 ||   SIREE RAAG,
        FIRST MEHL:  As it is pre-ordained, people speak their words.
        As it is pre-ordained, they consume their food. As it is pre-ordained,
        they walk along the way. As it is pre-ordained, they see and hear.
        As it is pre-ordained, they draw their breath. Why should I go
        and ask the scholars about this?  || 1 ||   O Baba, the splendor
        of Maya is deceptive. The blind man has forgotten the Name; he
        is in limbo, neither here nor there.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Life
        and death come to all who are born. Everything here gets devoured
        by Death. He sits and examines the accounts, there where no one
        goes along with anyone. Those who weep and wail might just as
        well all tie bundles of straw.  || 2 ||   Everyone says that God
        is the Greatest of the Great. No one calls Him any less. No one
        can estimate His Worth. By speaking of Him, His Greatness is not
        increased. You are the One True Lord and Master of all the other
        beings, of so many worlds.  || 3 ||   Nanak seeks the company
        of the lowest of the low class, the very lowest of the low. Why
        should he try to compete with the great? In that place where the
        lowly are cared for - there, the Blessings of Your Glance of
        Grace rain down.  || 4 || 3 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  Greed
        is a dog; falsehood is a filthy street-sweeper. Cheating is eating
        a rotting carcass. Slandering others is putting the filth of others
        into your own mouth. The fire of anger is the outcaste who burns
        dead bodies at the crematorium. I am caught in these tastes and
        flavors, and in self-conceited praise. These are my actions, O
        my Creator!  || 1 ||   O Baba, speak only that which will bring
        you honor. They alone are good, who are judged good at the Lord's
        Door. Those with bad karma can only sit and weep.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The pleasures of gold and silver, the pleasures of women,
        the pleasure of the fragrance of sandalwood, the pleasure of horses,
        the pleasure of a soft bed in a palace, the pleasure of sweet
        treats and the pleasure of hearty meals - these pleasures of
        the human body are so numerous; how can the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, find its dwelling in the heart?  || 2 ||   Those words
        are acceptable, which, when spoken, bring honor. Harsh words bring
        only grief. Listen, O foolish and ignorant mind! Those who are
        pleasing to Him are good. What else is there to be said?  || 3
        ||   Wisdom, honor and wealth are in the laps of those whose hearts
        remain permeated with the Lord. What praise can be offered to
        them? What other adornments can be bestowed upon them? O Nanak,
        those who lack the Lord's Glance of Grace cherish neither
        charity nor the Lord's Name.  || 4 || 4 ||   SIREE RAAG,
        FIRST MEHL:  The Great Giver has given the intoxicating drug
        of falsehood. The people are intoxicated; they have forgotten
        death, and they have fun for a few days. Those who do not use
        intoxicants are true; they dwell in the Court of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||   O Nanak, know the True Lord as True. Serving Him, peace
        is obtained; you shall go to His Court with honor.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Wine of Truth is not fermented from molasses. </p>

      </p>
      <p> The True Name is contained within it. I am a sacrifice to those
        who hear and chant the True Name. Only one who obtains a room
        in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is deemed to be truly
        intoxicated.  || 2 ||   Bathe in the waters of Goodness and apply
        the scented oil of Truth to your body, and your face shall become
        radiant. This is the gift of 100,000 gifts. Tell your troubles
        to the One who is the Source of all comfort.  || 3 ||   How can
        you forget the One who created your soul, and the praanaa, the
        breath of life? Without Him, all that we wear and eat is impure.
        Everything else is false. Whatever pleases Your Will is acceptable.
        || 4 || 5 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  Burn emotional attachment,
        and grind it into ink. Transform your intelligence into the purest
        of paper. Make the love of the Lord your pen, and let your consciousness
        be the scribe. Then, seek the Guru's Instructions, and record
        these deliberations. Write the Praises of the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord; write over and over again that He has no end or limitation.
        || 1 ||   O Baba, write such an account, that when it is asked
        for, it will bring the Mark of Truth.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There,
        where greatness, eternal peace and everlasting joy are bestowed,
        the faces of those whose minds are attuned to the True Name are
        anointed with the Mark of Grace. If one receives God's Grace,
        then such honors are received, and not by mere words.  || 2 ||
        Some come, and some arise and depart. They give themselves lofty
        names. Some are born beggars, and some hold vast courts. Going
        to the world hereafter, everyone shall realize that without the
        Name, it is all useless.  || 3 ||   I am terrified by the Fear
        of You, God. Bothered and bewildered, my body is wasting away.
        Those who are known as sultans and emperors shall be reduced to
        dust in the end. O Nanak, arising and departing, all false attachments
        are cut away.  || 4 || 6 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  Believing,
        all tastes are sweet. Hearing, the salty flavors are tasted; chanting
        with one's mouth, the spicy flavors are savored. All these
        spices have been made from the Sound-current of the Naad. The
        thirty-six flavors of ambrosial nectar are in the Love of the
        One Lord; they are tasted only by one who is blessed by His Glance
        of Grace.  || 1 ||   O Baba, the pleasures of other foods are
        false. Eating them, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption
        enter into the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My mind is imbued with
        the Lord's Love; it is dyed a deep crimson. Truth and charity
        are my white clothes. The blackness of sin is erased by my wearing
        of blue clothes, and meditation on the Lord's Lotus Feet
        is my robe of honor. Contentment is my cummerbund, Your Name is
        my wealth and youth.  || 2 ||   O Baba, the pleasures of other
        clothes are false. Wearing them, the body is ruined, and wickedness
        and corruption enter into the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        understanding of Your Way, Lord, is horses, saddles and bags of
        gold for me. The pursuit of virtue is my bow and arrow, my quiver,
        sword and scabbard. To be distinguished with honor is my drum
        and banner. Your Mercy is my social status.  || 3 ||   O Baba,
        the pleasures of other rides are false. By such rides, the body
        is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the pleasure
        of houses and mansions. Your Glance of Grace is my family, Lord. </p>

      <p> The Hukam of Your Command is the pleasure of Your Will, Lord.
        To say anything else is far beyond anyone's reach. O Nanak,
        the True King does not seek advice from anyone else in His decisions.
        || 4 ||   O Baba, the pleasure of other sleep is false. By such
        sleep, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter
        into the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 4 || 7 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST
        MEHL:  With the body of saffron, and the tongue a jewel, and the
        breath of the body pure fragrant incense; with the face anointed
        at the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, and the heart illuminated
        with wisdom - with that wisdom, chant the Praises of the True
        Name, the Treasure of Excellence.  || 1 ||   O Baba, other wisdom
        is useless and irrelevant. If falsehood is practiced a hundred
        times, it is still false in its effects.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        You may be worshipped and adored as a Pir (a spiritual teacher);
        you may be welcomed by all the world; you may adopt a lofty name,
        and be known to have supernatural spiritual powers - even so,
        if you are not accepted in the Court of the Lord, then all this
        adoration is false.  || 2 ||   No one can overthrow those who
        have been established by the True Guru. The Treasure of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, is within them, and through the Naam, they
        are radiant and famous. They worship the Naam, and they believe
        in the Naam. The True One is forever Intact and Unbroken.  ||
        3 ||   When the body mingles with dust, what happens to the soul?
        All clever tricks are burnt away, and you shall depart crying.
        O Nanak, those who forget the Naam - what will happen when
        they go to the Court of the Lord?  || 4 || 8 ||   SIREE RAAG,
        FIRST MEHL:  The virtuous wife exudes virtue; the unvirtuous
        suffer in misery. If you long for your Husband Lord, O soul-bride,
        you must know that He is not met by falsehood. No boat or raft
        can take you to Him. Your Husband Lord is far away.  || 1 || 
        My Lord and Master is Perfect; His Throne is Eternal and Immovable.
        One who attains perfection as Gurmukh, obtains the Immeasurable
        True Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Palace of the Lord God is
        so beautiful. Within it, there are gems, rubies, pearls and flawless
        diamonds. A fortress of gold surrounds this Source of Nectar.
        How can I climb up to the Fortress without a ladder? By meditating
        on the Lord, through the Guru, I am blessed and exalted.  || 2
        ||   The Guru is the Ladder, the Guru is the Boat, and the Guru
        is the Raft to take me to the Lord's Name. The Guru is the
        Boat to carry me across the world-ocean; the Guru is the Sacred
        Shrine of Pilgrimage, the Guru is the Holy River. If it pleases
        Him, I bathe in the Pool of Truth, and become radiant and pure.
        || 3 ||   He is called the Most Perfect of the Perfect. He sits
        upon His Perfect Throne. He looks so Beautiful in His Perfect
        Place. He fulfills the hopes of the hopeless. O Nanak, if one
        obtains the Perfect Lord, how can his virtues decrease?  || 4
        || 9 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  Come, my dear sisters and
        spiritual companions; hug me close in your embrace. Let's
        join together, and tell stories of our All-powerful Husband Lord.
        All Virtues are in our True Lord and Master; we are utterly without
        virtue.  || 1 ||   O Creator Lord, all are in Your Power. I dwell
        upon the One Word of the Shabad. You are mine - what else do
        I need?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Go, and ask the happy soul-brides,
  &quot;By what virtuous qualities do you enjoy your Husband Lord?&quot;
        &quot;We are adorned with intuitive ease, contentment and sweet
        words. </p>
      <p>

          <b><a name="p18" id="p18">Page 18</a></b>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> We meet with our Beloved, the Source of Joy, when we listen to
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad.&quot;  || 2 ||   You have
        so many Creative Powers, Lord; Your Bountiful Blessings are so
        Great. So many of Your beings and creatures praise You day and
        night. You have so many forms and colors, so many classes, high
        and low.  || 3 ||   Meeting the True One, Truth wells up. The
        truthful are absorbed into the True Lord. Intuitive understanding
        is obtained and one is welcomed with honor, through the Guru's
        Word, filled with the Fear of God. O Nanak, the True King absorbs
        us into Himself.  || 4 || 10 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  It
        all worked out - I was saved, and the egotism within my heart
        was subdued. The evil energies have been made to serve me, since
        I placed my faith in the True Guru. I have renounced my useless
        schemes, by the Grace of the True, Carefree Lord.  || 1 ||   O
        mind, meeting with the True One, fear departs. Without the Fear
        of God, how can anyone become fearless? Become Gurmukh, and immerse
        yourself in the Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   How can we describe
        Him with words? There is no end to the descriptions of Him. There
        are so many beggars, but He is the only Giver. He is the Giver
        of the soul, and the praanaa, the breath of life; when He dwells
        within the mind, there is peace.  || 2 ||   The world is a drama,
        staged in a dream. In a moment, the play is played out. Some attain
        union with the Lord, while others depart in separation. Whatever
        pleases Him comes to pass; nothing else can be done.  || 3 ||
        The Gurmukhs purchase the Genuine Article. The True Merchandise
        is purchased with the True Capital. Those who purchase this True
        Merchandise through the Perfect Guru are blessed. O Nanak, one
        who stocks this True Merchandise shall recognize and realize the
        Genuine Article.  || 4 || 11 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  As
        metal merges with metal, those who chant the Praises of the Lord
        are absorbed into the Praiseworthy Lord. Like the poppies, they
        are dyed in the deep crimson color of Truthfulness. Those contented
        souls who meditate on the Lord with single-minded love, meet the
        True Lord.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, become the dust of
        the feet of the humble Saints. In the Society of the Saints, the
        Guru is found. He is the Treasure of Liberation, the Source of
        all good fortune.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Upon that Highest Plane
        of Sublime Beauty, stands the Mansion of the Lord. By true actions,
        this human body is obtained, and the door within ourselves which
        leads to the Mansion of the Beloved, is found. The Gurmukhs train
        their minds to contemplate the Lord, the Supreme Soul.  || 2 ||
        By actions committed under the influence of the three qualities,
        hope and anxiety are produced. Without the Guru, how can anyone
        be released from these three qualities? Through intuitive wisdom,
        we meet with Him and find peace. Within the home of the self,
        the Mansion of His Presence is realized when He bestows His Glance
        of Grace and washes away our pollution.  || 3 ||   Without the
        Guru, this pollution is not removed. Without the Lord, how can
        there be any homecoming? Contemplate the One Word of the Shabad,
        and abandon other hopes. O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to
        the one who beholds, and inspires others to behold Him.  || 4
        || 12 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  The life of the discarded
        bride is cursed. She is deceived by the love of duality. Like
        a wall of sand, day and night, she crumbles, and eventually, she
        breaks down altogether. Without the Word of the Shabad, peace
        does not come. Without her Husband Lord, her suffering does not
        end.  || 1 ||   O soul-bride, without your Husband Lord, what
        good are your decorations? </p>

      <p> In this world, you shall not find any shelter; in the world hereafter,
        being false, you shall suffer.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The True
        Lord Himself knows all; He makes no mistakes. He is the Great
        Farmer of the Universe. First, He prepares the ground, and then
        He plants the Seed of the True Name. The nine treasures are produced
        from Name of the One Lord. By His Grace, we obtain His Banner
        and Insignia.  || 2 ||   Some are very knowledgeable, but if they
        do not know the Guru, then what is the use of their lives? The
        blind have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The self-willed
        manmukhs are in utter darkness. Their comings and goings in reincarnation
        do not end; through death and rebirth, they are wasting away.
        || 3 ||   The bride may buy sandalwood oil and perfumes, and
        apply them in great quantities to her hair; she may sweeten her
        breath with betel leaf and camphor, but if this bride is not pleasing
        to her Husband Lord, then all these trappings are false.  || 4
        ||   Her enjoyment of all pleasures is futile, and all her decorations
        are corrupt. Until she has been pierced through with the Shabad,
        how can she look beautiful at Guru's Gate? O Nanak, blessed
        is that fortunate bride, who is in love with her Husband Lord.
        || 5 || 13 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  The empty body is dreadful,
        when the soul goes out from within. The burning fire of life is
        extinguished, and the smoke of the breath no longer emerges. The
        five relatives (the senses) weep and wail painfully, and waste
        away through the love of duality.  || 1 ||   You fool: chant the
        Name of the Lord, and preserve your virtue. Egotism and possessiveness
        are very enticing; egotistical pride has plundered everyone. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, are attached to affairs of duality. Attached to duality,
        they putrefy and die; they are filled with the fire of desire
        within. Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; all others
        are cheated and plundered by deceitful worldly affairs.  || 2
        ||   Love dies, and affection vanishes. Hatred and alienation
        die. Entanglements end, and egotism dies, along with attachment
        to Maya, possessiveness and anger. Those who receive His Mercy
        obtain the True One. The Gurmukhs dwell forever in balanced restraint.
        || 3 ||   By true actions, the True Lord is met, and the Guru's
        Teachings are found. Then, they are not subject to birth and death;
        they do not come and go in reincarnation. O Nanak, they are respected
        at the Lord's Gate; they are robed in honor in the Court
        of the Lord.  || 4 || 14 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  The body
        is burnt to ashes; by its love of Maya, the mind is rusted through.
        Demerits become one's enemies, and falsehood blows the bugle
        of attack. Without the Word of the Shabad, people wander lost
        in reincarnation. Through the love of duality, multitudes have
        been drowned.  || 1 ||   O mind, swim across, by focusing your
        consciousness on the Shabad. Those who do not become Gurmukh do
        not understand the Naam; they die, and continue coming and going
        in reincarnation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That body is said to be
        pure, in which the True Name abides. One whose body is imbued
        with the Fear of the True One, and whose tongue savors Truthfulness,
        is brought to ecstasy by the True Lord's Glance of Grace.
        That person does not have to go through the fire of the womb again.
        || 2 ||   From the True Lord came the air, and from the air came
        water. From water, He created the three worlds; in each and every
        heart He has infused His Light. The Immaculate Lord does not become
        polluted. Attuned to the Shabad, honor is obtained.  || 3 || 
        One whose mind is contented with Truthfulness, is blessed with
        the Lord's Glance of Grace. </p>

      <p> The body of the five elements is dyed in the Fear of the True
        One; the mind is filled with the True Light. O Nanak, your demerits
        shall be forgotten; the Guru shall preserve your honor.  || 4
        || 15 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, the Boat of Truth
        will ferry you across; contemplate the Guru. Some come, and some
        go; they are totally filled with egotism. Through stubborn-mindedness,
        the intellect is drowned; one who becomes Gurmukh and truthful
        is saved.  || 1 ||   Without the Guru, how can anyone swim across
        to find peace? As it pleases You, Lord, You save me. There is
        no other for me at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In front of me,
        I see the jungle burning; behind me, I see green plants sprouting.
        We shall merge into the One from whom we came. The True One is
        pervading each and every heart. He Himself unites us in Union
        with Himself; the True Mansion of His Presence is close at hand.
        || 2 ||   With each and every breath, I dwell upon You; I shall
        never forget You. The more the Lord and Master dwells within the
        mind, the more the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. Mind
        and body are Yours; You are my Master. Please rid me of my pride,
        and let me merge with You.  || 3 ||   The One who formed this
        universe created the creation of the three worlds. The Gurmukh
        knows the Divine Light, while the foolish self-willed manmukh
        gropes around in the darkness. One who sees that Light within
        each and every heart understands the Essence of the Guru's
        Teachings.  || 4 ||   Those who understand are Gurmukh; recognize
        and applaud them. They meet and merge with the True One. They
        become the Radiant Manifestation of the Excellence of the True
        One. O Nanak, they are contented with the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord. They offer their bodies and souls to God.  || 5 || 16 ||
        SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  Listen, O my mind, my friend, my darling:
        now is the time to meet the Lord. As long as there is youth and
        breath, give this body to Him. Without virtue, it is useless;
        the body shall crumble into a pile of dust.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        earn the profit, before you return home. The Gurmukh praises the
        Naam, and the fire of egotism is extinguished.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Again and again, we hear and tell stories; we read and write
        and understand loads of knowledge, but still, desires increase
        day and night, and the disease of egotism fills us with corruption.
        That Carefree Lord cannot be appraised; His Real Value is known
        only through the Wisdom of the Guru's Teachings.  || 2 ||
        Even if someone has hundreds of thousands of clever mental tricks,
        and the love and company of hundreds of thousands of people - still,
        without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he will not
        feel satisfied. Without the Name, all suffer in sorrow. Chanting
        the Name of the Lord, O my soul, you shall be emancipated; as
        Gurmukh, you shall come to understand your own self.  || 3 ||
        I have sold my body and mind to the Guru, and I have given my
        mind and head as well. I was seeking and searching for Him throughout
        the three worlds; then, as Gurmukh, I sought and found Him. The
        True Guru has united me in Union, O Nanak, with that God.  ||
        4 || 17 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  I have no anxiety about
        dying, and no hope of living. You are the Cherisher of all beings;
        You keep the account of our breaths and morsels of food. You abide
        within the Gurmukh. As it pleases You, You decide our allotment.
        || 1 ||   O my soul, chant the Name of the Lord; the mind will
        be pleased and appeased. </p>

      </p>
      <p> The raging fire within is extinguished; the Gurmukh obtains spiritual
        wisdom.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Know the state of your inner being;
        meet with the Guru and get rid of your skepticism. To reach your
        True Home after you die, you must conquer death while you are
        still alive. The beautiful, Unstruck Sound of the Shabad is obtained,
        contemplating the Guru.  || 2 ||   The Unstruck Melody of Gurbani
        is obtained, and egotism is eliminated. I am forever a sacrifice
        to those who serve their True Guru. They are dressed in robes
        of honor in the Court of the Lord; the Name of the Lord is on
        their lips.  || 3 ||   Wherever I look, I see the Lord pervading
        there, in the union of Shiva and Shakti, of consciousness and
        matter. The three qualities hold the body in bondage; whoever
        comes into the world is subject to their play. Those who separate
        themselves from the Lord wander lost in misery. The self-willed
        manmukhs do not attain union with Him.  || 4 ||   If the mind
        becomes balanced and detached, and comes to dwell in its own true
        home, imbued with the Fear of God, then it enjoys the essence
        of supreme spiritual wisdom; it shall never feel hunger again.
        O Nanak, conquer and subdue this mind; meet with the Lord, and
        you shall never again suffer in pain.  || 5 || 18 ||   SIREE RAAG,
        FIRST MEHL:  This foolish mind is greedy; through greed, it becomes
        even more attached to greed. The evil-minded shaaktas, the faithless
        cynics, are not attuned to the Shabad; they come and go in reincarnation.
        One who meets with the Holy True Guru finds the Treasure of Excellence.
        || 1 ||   O mind, renounce your egotistical pride. Serve the
        Lord, the Guru, the Sacred Pool, and you shall be honored in the
        Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Chant the Name of the
        Lord day and night; become Gurmukh, and know the Wealth of the
        Lord. All comforts and peace, and the Essence of the Lord, are
        enjoyed by acquiring spiritual wisdom in the Society of the Saints.
        Day and night, continually serve the Lord God; the True Guru has
        given the Naam.  || 2 ||   Those who practice falsehood are dogs;
        those who slander the Guru shall burn in their own fire. They
        wander lost and confused, deceived by doubt, suffering in terrible
        pain. The Messenger of Death shall beat them to a pulp. The self-willed
        manmukhs find no peace, while the Gurmukhs are wondrously joyful.
        || 3 ||   In this world, people are engrossed in false pursuits,
        but in the world hereafter, only the account of your true actions
        is accepted. The Guru serves the Lord, His Intimate Friend. The
        Guru's actions are supremely exalted. O Nanak, never forget
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the True Lord shall bless you
        with His Mark of Grace.  || 4 || 19 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:
        Forgetting the Beloved, even for a moment, the mind is afflicted
        with terrible diseases. How can honor be attained in His Court,
        if the Lord does not dwell in the mind? Meeting with the Guru,
        peace is found. The fire is extinguished in His Glorious Praises.
        || 1 ||   O mind, enshrine the Praises of the Lord, day and night.
        One who does not forget the Naam, for a moment or even an instant - how
        rare is such a person in this world!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When
        one's light merges into the Light, and one's intuitive
        consciousness is joined with the Intuitive Consciousness, then
        one's cruel and violent instincts and egotism depart, and
        skepticism and sorrow are taken away. The Lord abides within the
        mind of the Gurmukh, who merges in the Lord's Union, through
        the Guru.  || 2 ||   If I surrender my body like a bride, the
        Enjoyer will enjoy me. Do not make love with one who is just a
        passing show. </p>

      <p> The Gurmukh is ravished like the pure and happy bride on the Bed
        of God, her Husband.  || 3 ||   The Gurmukh puts out the four
        fires, with the Water of the Lord's Name. The lotus blossoms
        deep within the heart, and filled with Ambrosial Nectar, one is
        satisfied. O Nanak, make the True Guru your friend; going to His
        Court, you shall obtain the True Lord.  || 4 || 20 ||   SIREE
        RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  Meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, O my beloved;
        follow the Guru's Teachings, and speak of the Lord. Apply
        the Touchstone of Truth to your mind, and see if it comes up to
        its full weight. No one has found the worth of the ruby of the
        heart; its value cannot be estimated.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of
        Destiny, the Diamond of the Lord is within the Guru. The True
        Guru is found in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Day and
        night, praise the Word of His Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        True Merchandise, Wealth and Capital are obtained through the
        Radiant Light of the Guru. Just as fire is extinguished by pouring
        on water, desire becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves.
        The Messenger of Death will not touch you; in this way, you shall
        cross over the terrifying world-ocean, carrying others across
        with you.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukhs do not like falsehood. They
        are imbued with Truth; they love only Truth. The shaaktas, the
        faithless cynics, do not like the Truth; false are the foundations
        of the false. Imbued with Truth, you shall meet the Guru. The
        true ones are absorbed into the True Lord.  || 3 ||   Within the
        mind are emeralds and rubies, the Jewel of the Naam, treasures
        and diamonds. The Naam is the True Merchandise and Wealth; in
        each and every heart, His Presence is deep and profound. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukh finds the Diamond of the Lord, by His Kindness and
        Compassion.  || 4 || 21 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  The fire
        of doubt is not extinguished, even by wandering through foreign
        lands and countries. If inner filth is not removed, one's
        life is cursed, and one's clothes are cursed. There is no
        other way to perform devotional worship, except through the Teachings
        of the True Guru.  || 1 ||   O mind, become Gurmukh, and extinguish
        the fire within. Let the Words of the Guru abide within your mind;
        let egotism and desires die.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The jewel of
        the mind is priceless; through the Name of the Lord, honor is
        obtained. Join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and find
        the Lord. The Gurmukh embraces love for the Lord. Give up your
        selfishness, and you shall find peace; like water mingling with
        water, you shall merge in absorption.  || 2 ||   Those who have
        not contemplated the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are unworthy;
        they come and go in reincarnation. One who has not met with the
        True Guru, the Primal Being, is bothered and bewildered in the
        terrifying world-ocean. This jewel of the soul is priceless, and
        yet it is being squandered like this, in exchange for a mere shell.
        || 3 ||   Those who joyfully meet with the True Guru are perfectly
        fulfilled and wise. Meeting with the Guru, they cross over the
        terrifying world-ocean. In the Court of the Lord, they are honored
        and approved. O Nanak, their faces are radiant; the Music of the
        Shabad, the Word of God, wells up within them.  || 4 || 22 ||
        SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  Make your deals, dealers, and take
        care of your merchandise. Buy that object which will go along
        with you. In the next world, the All-knowing Merchant will take
        this object and care for it.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny,
        chant the Lord's Name, and focus your consciousness on Him.
        Take the Merchandise of the Lord's Praises with you. </p>

      <p> Your Husband Lord shall see this and approve.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Those who do not have the Assets of Truth - how can they
        find peace? By dealing their deals of falsehood, their minds and
        bodies become false. Like the deer caught in the trap, they suffer
        in terrible agony; they continually cry out in pain.  || 2 ||
        The counterfeit coins are not put into the Treasury; they do
        not obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord-Guru. The false ones
        have no social status or honor. No one succeeds through falsehood.
        Practicing falsehood again and again, people come and go in reincarnation,
        and forfeit their honor.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, instruct your mind
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and praise the Lord.
        Those who are imbued with the love of the Name of the Lord are
        not loaded down by doubt. Those who chant the Name of the Lord
        earn great profits; the Fearless Lord abides within their minds.
        || 4 || 23 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:  Wealth,
        the beauty of youth and flowers are guests for only a few days.
        Like the leaves of the water-lily, they wither and fade and finally
        die.  || 1 ||   Be happy, dear beloved, as long as your youth
        is fresh and delightful. But your days are few - you have grown
        weary, and now your body has grown old.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        My playful friends have gone to sleep in the graveyard. In my
        double-mindedness, I shall have to go as well. I cry in a feeble
        voice.  || 2 ||   Haven't you heard the call from beyond,
        O beautiful soul-bride? You must go to your in-laws; you cannot
        stay with your parents forever.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, know that
        she who sleeps in her parents' home is plundered in broad
        daylight. She has lost her bouquet of merits; gathering one of
        demerits, she departs.  || 4 || 24 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,
        SECOND HOUSE:  He Himself is the Enjoyer, and He Himself is the
        Enjoyment. He Himself is the Ravisher of all. He Himself is the
        Bride in her dress, He Himself is the Bridegroom on the bed. 
        || 1 ||   My Lord and Master is imbued with love; He is totally
        permeating and pervading all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself
        is the fisherman and the fish; He Himself is the water and the
        net. He Himself is the sinker, and He Himself is the bait.  ||
        2 ||   He Himself loves in so many ways. O sister soul-brides,
        He is my Beloved. He continually ravishes and enjoys the happy
        soul-brides; just look at the plight I am in without Him!  ||
        3 ||   Prays Nanak, please hear my prayer: You are the pool, and
        You are the soul-swan. You are the lotus flower of the day and
        You are the water-lily of the night. You Yourself behold them,
        and blossom forth in bliss.  || 4 || 25 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST
        MEHL,  THIRD HOUSE:  Make this body the field, and plant the seed
        of good actions. Water it with the Name of the Lord, who holds
        all the world in His Hands. Let your mind be the farmer; the Lord
        shall sprout in your heart, and you shall attain the state of
        Nirvaanaa.  || 1 ||   You fool! Why are you so proud of Maya?
        Father, children, spouse, mother and all relatives - they shall
        not be your helpers in the end.  ||  Pause  ||   So weed out evil,
        wickedness and corruption; leave these behind, and let your soul
        meditate on God. When chanting, austere meditation and self-discipline
        become your protectors, then the lotus blossoms forth, and the
        honey trickles out.  || 2 ||   Bring the twenty-seven elements
        of the body under your control, and throughout the three stages
        of life, remember death. See the Infinite Lord in the ten directions,
        and in all the variety of nature. Says Nanak, in this way, the
        One Lord shall carry you across.  || </p>

        deeds the soil, and let the Word of the Shabad be the seed; irrigate
        it continually with the water of Truth. Become such a farmer,
        and faith will sprout. This brings knowledge of heaven and hell,
        you fool!  || 1 ||   Do not think that your Husband Lord can be
        obtained by mere words. You are wasting this life in the pride
        of wealth and the splendor of beauty.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        defect of the body which leads to sin is the mud puddle, and this
        mind is the frog, which does not appreciate the lotus flower at
        all. The bumble bee is the teacher who continually teaches the
        lesson. But how can one understand, unless one is made to understand?
        || 2 ||   This speaking and listening is like the song of the
        wind, for those whose minds are colored by the love of Maya. The
        Grace of the Master is bestowed upon those who meditate on Him
        alone. They are pleasing to His Heart.  || 3 ||   You may observe
        the thirty fasts, and say the five prayers each day, but 'Satan'
        can undo them. Says Nanak, you will have to walk on the Path of
        Death, so why do you bother to collect wealth and property?  ||
        4 || 27 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,  FOURTH HOUSE:  He is the
        Master who has made the world bloom; He makes the Universe blossom
        forth, fresh and green. He holds the water and the land in bondage.
        Hail to the Creator Lord!  || 1 ||   Death, O Mullah - death
        will come, so live in the Fear of God the Creator.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   You are a Mullah, and you are a Qazi, only when you know
        the Naam, the Name of God. You may be very educated, but no one
        can remain when the measure of life is full.  || 2 ||   He alone
        is a Qazi, who renounces selfishness and conceit, and makes the
        One Name his Support. The True Creator Lord is, and shall always
        be. He was not born; He shall not die.  || 3 ||   You may chant
        your prayers five times each day; you may read the Bible and the
        Koran. Says Nanak, the grave is calling you, and now your food
        and drink are finished.  || 4 || 28 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,
        FOURTH HOUSE:  The dogs of greed are with me. In the early morning,
        they continually bark at the wind. Falsehood is my dagger; through
        deception, I eat the carcasses of the dead. I live as a wild hunter,
        O Creator!  || 1 ||   I have not followed good advice, nor have
        I done good deeds. I am deformed and horribly disfigured. Your
        Name alone, Lord, saves the world. This is my hope; this is my
        support.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   With my mouth I speak slander,
        day and night. I spy on the houses of others - I am such a
        wretched low-life! Unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger
        dwell in my body, like the outcasts who cremate the dead. I live
        as a wild hunter, O Creator!  || 2 ||   I make plans to trap others,
        although I appear gentle. I am a robber - I rob the world.
        I am very clever - I carry loads of sin. I live as a wild hunter,
        O Creator!  || 3 ||   I have not appreciated what You have done
        for me, Lord; I take from others and exploit them. What face shall
        I show You, Lord? I am a sneak and a thief. Nanak describes the
        state of the lowly. I live as a wild hunter, O Creator!  || 4
        || 29 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,  FOURTH HOUSE:  There is one
        awareness among all created beings. None have been created without
        this awareness. </p>

      <p> As is their awareness, so is their way. According to the account
        of our actions, we come and go in reincarnation.  || 1 ||   Why,
        O soul, do you try such clever tricks? Taking away and giving
        back, God does not delay.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All beings belong
        to You; all beings are Yours. O Lord and Master, how can You become
        angry with them? Even if You, O Lord and Master, become angry
        with them, still, You are theirs, and they are Yours.  || 2 ||
        We are foul-mouthed; we spoil everything with our foul words.
        You weigh us in the balance of Your Glance of Grace. When one's
        actions are right, the understanding is perfect. Without good
        deeds, it becomes more and more deficient.  || 3 ||   Prays Nanak,
        what is the nature of the spiritual people? They are self-realized;
        they understand God. By Guru's Grace, they contemplate Him;
        such spiritual people are honored in His Court.  || 4 || 30 ||
        SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,  FOURTH HOUSE:  You are the River,
        All-knowing and All-seeing. I am just a fish - how can I find
        Your limit? Wherever I look, You are there. Outside of You, I
        would burst and die.  || 1 ||   I do not know of the fisherman,
        and I do not know of the net. But when the pain comes, then I
        call upon You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are present everywhere.
        I had thought that You were far away. Whatever I do, I do in Your
        Presence. You see all my actions, and yet I deny them. I have
        not worked for You, or Your Name.  || 2 ||   Whatever You give
        me, that is what I eat. There is no other door - unto which
        door should I go? Nanak offers this one prayer: this body and
        soul are totally Yours.  || 3 ||   He Himself is near, and He
        Himself is far away; He Himself is in-between. He Himself beholds,
        and He Himself listens. By His Creative Power, He created the
        world. Whatever pleases Him, O Nanak - that Command is acceptable.
        || 4 || 31 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,  FOURTH HOUSE:  Why
        should the created beings feel pride in their minds? The Gift
        is in the Hands of the Great Giver. As it pleases Him, He may
        give, or not give. What can be done by the order of the created
        beings?  || 1 ||   He Himself is True; Truth is pleasing to His
        Will. The spiritually blind are unripe and imperfect, inferior
        and worthless.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One who owns the trees
        of the forest and the plants of the garden - according to their
        nature, He gives them all their names. The Flower and the Fruit
        of the Lord's Love are obtained by pre-ordained destiny.
        As we plant, so we harvest and eat.  || 2 ||   The wall of the
        body is temporary, as is the soul-mason within it. The flavor
        of the intellect is bland and insipid without the Salt. O Nanak,
        as He wills, He makes things right. Without the Name, no one is
        approved.  || 3 || 32 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,  FIFTH HOUSE:
        The Undeceiveable is not deceived by deception. He cannot be
        wounded by any dagger. As our Lord and Master keeps us, so do
        we exist. The soul of this greedy person is tossed this way and
        that.  || 1 ||   Without the oil, how can the lamp be lit?  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Let the reading of your prayer book be the oil,
        and let the Fear of God be the wick for the lamp of this body.
        Light this lamp with the understanding of Truth.  || 2 ||   Use
        this oil to light this lamp. Light it, and meet your Lord and
        Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This body is softened with the Word
        of the Guru's Bani; you shall find peace, doing seva (selfless
        service). </p>

        3 ||   In the midst of this world, do seva, and you shall be given
        a place of honor in the Court of the Lord. Says Nanak, swing your
        arms in joy!  || 4 || 33 || </p>

        SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> I serve my True Guru with single-minded devotion, and lovingly
        focus my consciousness on Him. The True Guru is the mind's
        desire and the sacred shrine of pilgrimage, for those unto whom
        He has given this understanding. The blessings of the wishes of
        the mind are obtained, and the fruits of one's desires. Meditate
        on the Name, worship the Name, and through the Name, you shall
        be absorbed in intuitive peace and poise.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and your thirst shall
        be quenched. Those Gurmukhs who have tasted it remain intuitively
        absorbed in the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who serve the
        True Guru obtain the Treasure of the Naam. Deep within, they are
        drenched with the Essence of the Lord, and the egotistical pride
        of the mind is subdued. The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and they
        intuitively center themselves in meditation. Their minds become
        pure, and they remain immersed in the Lord; they are honored in
        His Court.  || 2 ||   Those who serve the True Guru in this world
        are very rare. Those who keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts
        subdue egotism and possessiveness. I am a sacrifice to those who
        are in love with the Naam. Those who attain the Inexhaustible
        Name of the Infinite Lord remain happy throughout the four ages.
        || 3 ||   Meeting with the Guru, the Naam is obtained, and the
        thirst of emotional attachment departs. When the mind is permeated
        with the Lord, one remains detached within the home of the heart.
        I am a sacrifice to those who enjoy the Sublime Taste of the Lord.
        O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace, the True Name, the Treasure of
        Excellence, is obtained.  || 4 || 1 || 34 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD
        MEHL:  People wear all sorts of costumes and wander all around,
        but in their hearts and minds, they practice deception. They do
        not attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and after
        death, they sink into manure.  || 1 ||   O mind, remain detached
        in the midst of your household. Practicing truth, self-discipline
        and good deeds, the Gurmukh is enlightened.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the mind is conquered,
        and one attains the State of Liberation in one's own home.
        So meditate on the Name of the Lord; join and merge with the Sat
        Sangat, the True Congregation.  || 2 ||   You may enjoy the pleasures
        of hundreds of thousands of women, and rule the nine continents
        of the world. But without the True Guru, you will not find peace;
        you will be reincarnated over and over again.  || 3 ||   Those
        who wear the Necklace of the Lord around their necks, and focus
        their consciousness on the Guru's Feet - wealth and supernatural
        spiritual powers follow them, but they do not care for such things
        at all.  || 4 ||   Whatever pleases God's Will comes to pass.
        Nothing else can be done. Servant Nanak lives by chanting the
        Naam. <br>
