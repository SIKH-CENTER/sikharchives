      <p> <font color="#000000">Your Name carries us across; Your Name brings
        respect and worship. Your Name embellishes us; it is the object
        of the awakened mind. Your Name brings honor to everyone's
        name. Without Your Name, no one is ever respected.  || 1 ||  
        All other clever tricks are just for show. Whoever the Lord blesses
        with forgiveness - his affairs are perfectly resolved.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your Name is my strength; Your Name is my
        support. Your Name is my army; Your Name is my king. Your Name
        brings honor, glory and approval. By Your Grace, one is blessed
        with the banner and the insignia of Your Mercy.  || 2 ||   Your
        Name brings intuitive peace and poise; Your Name brings praise.
        Your Name is the Ambrosial Nectar which cleans out the poison.
        Through Your Name, all peace and comfort comes to abide in the
        mind. Without the Name, they are bound and gagged, and dragged
        off to the City of Death.  || 3 ||   Man is involved with his
        wife, hearth and home, land and country, the pleasures of the
        mind and fine clothes; but when the call comes, he cannot delay.
        O Nanak, in the end, the false turn out to be false.  || 4 ||
        1 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Your Name is the Jewel, and Your
        Grace is the Light. In awareness, there is Your Light. Darkness
        fills the dark, and then everything is lost.  || 1 ||   This whole
        world is corrupt. Your Name is the only cure; nothing else works,
        O Infinite Creator Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One side of the
        scale holds tens of thousands, millions of nether regions and
        realms. <br>

      </p>
      <p> O my Beloved, Your Worth could only be estimated if something
        else could be placed on the other side of the scale.  || 2 ||
        Out of pain, pleasure is produced, and out of pleasure comes
        pain. That mouth which praises You - what hunger could
        that mouth ever suffer?  || 3 ||   O Nanak, you alone are foolish;
        all the rest of the world is good. That body in which the Naam
        does not well up - that body becomes miserable.  || 4 ||
        2 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  For His sake, Brahma uttered
        the Vedas, and Shiva renounced Maya. For His sake, the Siddhas
        became hermits and renunciates; even the gods have not realized
        His Mystery.  || 1 ||   O Baba, keep the True Lord in your mind,
        and utter the Name of the True Lord with your mouth; the True
        Lord will carry you across. Enemies and pain shall not even approach
        you; only a rare few realize the Wisdom of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Fire, water and air make up the world; these three
        are the slaves of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. One who does
        not chant the Naam is a thief, dwelling in the fortress of the
        five thieves.  || 2 ||   If someone does a good deed for someone
        else, he totally puffs himself up in his conscious mind. The Lord
        bestows so many virtues and so much goodness; He does not ever
        regret it.  || 3 ||   Those who praise You gather the wealth in
        their laps; this is Nanak's wealth. Whoever shows respect
        to them is not summoned by the Messenger of Death.  || 4 || 3
        ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  One who has no beauty, no social
        status, no mouth, no flesh - meeting with the True Guru,
        he finds the Immaculate Lord, and dwells in Your Name.  || 1 ||
        O detached Yogi, contemplate the essence of reality, and you
        shall never again come to be born into the world.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   One who does not have good karma or Dharmic faith, sacred
        rosary or mala - through the Light of God, wisdom is bestowed;
        the True Guru is our Protector.  || 2 ||   One who does not observe
        any fasts, make religious vows or chant - he does not have
        to worry about good luck or bad, if he obeys the Command of the
        True Guru.  || 3 ||   One who is not hopeful, nor hopeless, who
        has trained his intuitive consciousness - his being blends
        with the Supreme Being. O Nanak, his awareness is awakened.  ||
        4 || 4 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  What he says is approved
        in the Court of the Lord. He looks upon poison and nectar as one
        and the same.  || 1 ||   What can I say? You are permeating and
        pervading all. Whatever happens, is all by Your Will.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The Divine Light shines radiantly, and egotistical
        pride is dispelled. The True Guru bestows the Ambrosial Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,
        one's birth is approved, if one is honored in the True
        Court.  || 3 ||   Speaking and listening, one goes to the Celestial
        Home of the Indescribable Lord. Mere words of mouth, O Nanak,
        are burnt away.  || 4 || 5 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  One
        who bathes in the Ambrosial Water of spiritual wisdom takes with
        him the virtues of the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
        The Guru's Teachings are the gems and jewels; the Sikh
        who serves Him searches and finds them.  || 1 ||   There is no
        sacred shrine equal to the Guru. The Guru encompasses the ocean
        of contentment. <br>

      </p>
      <p> || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru is the River, from which the Pure
        Water is obtained forever; it washes away the filth and pollution
        of evil-mindedness. Finding the True Guru, the perfect cleansing
        bath is obtained, which transforms even beasts and ghosts into
        gods.  || 2 ||   He is said to be the Guru, with the scent of
        sandalwood, who is imbued with the True Name to the bottom of
        His Heart. By His Fragrance, the world of vegetation is perfumed.
        Lovingly focus yourself on His Feet.  || 3 ||   The life of the
        soul wells up for the Gurmukh; the Gurmukh goes to the House of
        God. The Gurmukh, O Nanak, merges in the True One; the Gurmukh
        attains the exalted state of the self.  || 4 || 6 ||   PRABHAATEE,
        FIRST MEHL:  By Guru's Grace, contemplate spiritual knowledge;
        read it and study it, and you shall be honored. Within the self,
        the self is revealed, when one is blessed with the Ambrosial Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Creator Lord, You alone are
        my Benefactor. I beg for only one blessing from You: please bless
        me with Your Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The five wandering thieves
        are captured and held, and the egotistical pride of the mind is
        subdued. Visions of corruption, vice and evil-mindedness run away.
        Such is the spiritual wisdom of God.  || 2 ||   Please bless me
        with the rice of truth and self-restraint, the wheat of compassion,
        and the leaf-plate of meditation. Bless me with the milk of good
        karma, and the clarified butter, the ghee, of compassion. Such
        are the gifts I beg of You, Lord.  || 3 ||   Let forgiveness and
        patience be my milk-cows, and let the calf of my mind intuitively
        drink in this milk. I beg for the clothes of modesty and the Lord's
        Praise; Nanak chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 4 ||
        7 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  No one can hold anyone back from
        coming; how could anyone hold anyone back from going? He alone
        thoroughly understands this, from whom all beings come; all are
        merged and immersed in Him.  || 1 ||   Waaho! - You are
        Great, and Wondrous is Your Will. Whatever You do, surely comes
        to pass. Nothing else can happen.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The buckets
        on the chain of the Persian wheel rotate; one empties out to fill
        another. This is just like the Play of our Lord and Master; such
        is His Glorious Greatness.  || 2 ||   Following the path of intuitive
        awareness, one turns away from the world, and one's vision
        is enlightened. Contemplate this in your mind, and see, O spiritual
        teacher. Who is the householder, and who is the renunciate?  ||
        3 ||   Hope comes from the Lord; surrendering to Him, we remain
        in the state of nirvaanaa. We come from Him; surrendering to Him,
        O Nanak, one is approved as a householder, and a renunciate. 
        || 4 || 8 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  I am a sacrifice to that
        one who binds in bondage his evil and corrupted gaze. One who
        does not know the difference between vice and virtue wanders around
        uselessly.  || 1 ||   Speak the True Name of the Creator Lord.
        Then, you shall never again have to come into this world.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Creator transforms the high into the low,
        and makes the lowly into kings. Those who know the All-knowing
        Lord are approved and certified as perfect in this world.  ||
        2 ||   If anyone is mistaken and fooled, you should go to instruct
        him. <br>

      </p>
      <p> The Creator Himself plays all the games; only a few understand
        this.  || 3 ||   Meditate on the Name, and the Word of the Shabad,
        in the early hours before dawn; leave your worldly entanglements
        behind. Prays Nanak, the slave of God's slaves: the world
        loses, and he wins.  || 4 || 9||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  The
        mind is Maya, the mind is a chaser; the mind is a bird flying
        across the sky. The thieves are overpowered by the Shabad, and
        then the body-village prospers and celebrates. Lord, when You
        save someone, he is saved; his capital is safe and sound.  ||
        1 ||   Such is my Treasure, the Jewel of the Naam; please bless
        me with the Guru's Teachings, so that I may fall at Your
        Feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The mind is a Yogi, the mind is a
        pleasure-seeker; the mind is foolish and ignorant. The mind is
        the giver, the mind is the beggar; the mind is the Great Guru,
        the Creator. The five thieves are conquered, and peace is attained;
        such is the contemplative wisdom of God.  || 2 ||   The One Lord
        is said to be in each and every heart, but no one can see Him.
        The false are cast upside-down into the womb of reincarnation;
        without the Name, they lose their honor. Those whom You unite,
        remain united, if it is Your Will.  || 3 ||   God does not ask
        about social class or birth; you must find your true home. That
        is your social class and that is your status - the karma
        of what you have done. The pains of death and rebirth are eradicated;
        O Nanak, salvation is in the Lord's Name.  || 4 || 10 ||
        PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  He is awake, and even happy, but he
        is being plundered - he is blind! The noose is around his
        neck, and yet, his head is busy with worldly affairs. In hope,
        he comes and in desire, he leaves. The strings of his life are
        all tangled up; he is utterly helpless.  || 1 ||   The Lord of
        Awareness, the Lord of Life is awake and aware. He is the Ocean
        of peace, the Treasure of Ambrosial Nectar.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        He does not understand what he is told; he is blind -
        he does not see, and so he does his evil deeds. The Transcendent
        Lord Himself showers His Love and Affection; by His Grace, He
        bestows glorious greatness.  || 2 ||   With the coming of each
        and every day, his life is wearing away, bit by bit; but still,
        his heart is attached to Maya. Without the Guru, he is drowned,
        and finds no place of rest, as long as he is caught in duality.
        || 3 ||   Day and night, God watches over and takes care of His
        living beings; they receive pleasure and pain according to their
        past actions. Nanak, the unfortunate one, begs for the charity
        of Truth; please bless him with this glory.  || 4 || 11 ||   PRABHAATEE,
        FIRST MEHL:  If I remain silent, the world calls me a fool. If
        I talk too much, I miss out on Your Love. My mistakes and faults
        will be judged in Your Court. Without the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, how can I maintain good conduct?  || 1 ||   Such is the
        falsehood which is plundering the world. The slanderer slanders
        me, but even so, I love him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He alone knows
        the way, who has been slandered. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, he is stamped with the Lord's Insignia in His Court.
        He realizes the Naam, the Cause of causes, deep within himself.
        He alone knows the way, who is blessed by the Lord's Glance
        of Grace.  || 2 ||   I am filthy and polluted; the True Lord is
        Immaculate and Sublime. Calling oneself sublime, one does not
        become exalted. The self-willed manmukh openly eats the great
        poison. But one who becomes Gurmukh is absorbed in the Name.

      <p> I am blind, deaf, foolish and ignorant, the lowest of the low,
        the worst of the worst. I am poor, but I have the Wealth of Your
        Name, O my Beloved. This is the most excellent wealth; all else
        is poison and ashes.  || 4 ||   I pay no attention to slander
        and praise; I contemplate the Word of the Shabad. I celebrate
        the One who blesses me with His Bounty. Whomever You forgive,
        O Lord, is blessed with status and honor. Says Nanak, I speak
        as He causes me to speak.  || 5 || 12 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  Eating too much, one's filth only increases; wearing
        fancy clothes, one's home is disgraced. Talking too much,
        one only starts arguments. Without the Name, everything is poison
        - know this well.  || 1 ||   O Baba, such is the treacherous
        trap which has caught my mind; riding out the waves of the storm,
        it will be enlightened by intuitive wisdom.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        They eat poison, speak poison and do poisonous deeds. Bound
        and gagged at Death's door, they are punished; they can
        be saved only through the True Name.  || 2 ||   As they come,
        they go. Their actions are recorded, and go along with them. The
        self-willed manmukh loses his capital, and is punished in the
        Court of the Lord.  || 3 ||   The world is false and polluted;
        only the True One is Pure. Contemplate Him through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad. Those who have God's spiritual
        wisdom within, are known to be very rare.  || 4 ||   They endure
        the unendurable, and the Nectar of the Lord, the Embodiment of
        Bliss, trickles into them continuously. O Nanak, the fish is in
        love with the water; if it pleases You, Lord, please enshrine
        such love within me.  || 5 || 13 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:
        Songs, sounds, pleasures and clever tricks; joy, love and the
        power to command; fine clothes and food - these have no
        place in one's consciousness. True intuitive peace and
        poise rest in the Naam.  || 1 ||   What do I know about what God
        does? Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, nothing makes my
        body feel good.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Yoga, thrills, delicious
        flavors and ecstasy; wisdom, truth and love all come from devotion
        to the Lord of the Universe. My own occupation is to work to praise
        the Lord. Deep within, I dwell on the Lord of the sun and the
        moon.  || 2 ||   I have lovingly enshrined the love of my Beloved
        within my heart. My Husband Lord, the Lord of the World, is the
        Master of the meek and the poor. Night and day, the Naam is my
        giving in charity and fasting. The waves have subsided, contemplating
        the essence of reality.  || 3 ||   What power do I have to speak
        the Unspoken? I worship You with devotion; You inspire me to do
        so. You dwell deep within; my egotism is dispelled. So whom should
        I serve? There is no other than You.  || 4 ||   The Word of the
        Guru's Shabad is utterly sweet and sublime. Such is the
        Ambrosial Nectar I see deep within. Those who taste this, attain
        the state of perfection. O Nanak, they are satisfied, and their
        bodies are at peace.  || 5 || 14 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:
        Deep within, I see the Shabad, the Word of God; my mind is pleased
        and appeased. Nothing else can touch and imbue me. Day and night,
        God watches over and cares for His beings and creatures; He is
        the Ruler of all.  || 1 ||   My God is dyed in the most beautiful
        and glorious color. Merciful to the meek and the poor, my Beloved
        is the Enticer of the mind; He is so very sweet, imbued with the
        deep crimson color of His Love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Well
        is high up in the Tenth Gate; the Ambrosial Nectar flows, and
        I drink it in. <br>

      <p> The creation is His; He alone knows its ways and means. The Gurmukh
        contemplates spiritual wisdom.  || 2 ||   The rays of light spread
        out, and the heart-lotus joyfully blossoms forth; the sun enters
        into the house of the moon. I have conquered death; the desires
        of the mind are destroyed. By Guru's Grace, I have found
        God.  || 3 ||   I am dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love.
        I am not colored by any other color. O Nanak, my tongue is saturated
        with the taste of God, who is permeating and pervading everywhere.
        || 4 || 15 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  The Yogis are divided
        into twelve schools, the Sannyaasees into ten. The Yogis and those
        wearing religious robes, and the Jains with their all hair plucked
        out - without the Word of the Shabad, the noose is around
        their necks.  || 1 ||   Those who are imbued with the Shabad are
        the perfectly detached renunciates. They beg to receive charity
        in the hands of their hearts, embracing love and affection for
        the One.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Brahmins study and argue about
        the scriptures; they perform ceremonial rituals, and lead others
        in these rituals. Without true understanding, those self-willed
        manmukhs understand nothing. Separated from God, they suffer in
        pain.  || 2 ||   Those who receive the Shabad are sanctified and
        pure; they are approved in the True Court. Night and day, they
        remain lovingly attuned to the Naam; throughout the ages, they
        are merged in the True One.  || 3 ||   Good deeds, righteousness
        and Dharmic faith, purification, austere self-discipline, chanting,
        intense meditation and pilgrimages to sacred shrines -
        all these abide in the Shabad. O Nanak, united in union with the
        True Guru, suffering, sin and death run away.  || 4 || 16 || 
        PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  The dust of the feet of the Saints,
        the Company of the Holy, and the Praises of the Lord carry us
        across to the other side. What can the wretched, terrified Messenger
        of Death do to the Gurmukhs? The Lord abides in their hearts.
        || 1 ||   Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, life might
        just as well be burnt down. The Gurmukh chants and meditates on
        the Lord, chanting the chant on the mala; the Flavor of the Lord
        comes into the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who follow the
        Guru's Teachings find true peace - how can I even
        describe the glory of such a person? The Gurmukh seeks and finds
        the gems and jewels, diamonds, rubies and treasures.  || 2 ||
        So center yourself on the treasures of spiritual wisdom and
        meditation; remain lovingly attuned to the One True Lord, and
        the Word of His Shabad. Remain absorbed in the Primal State of
        the Fearless, Immaculate, Independent, Self-sufficient Lord. 
        || 3 ||   The seven seas are overflowing with the Immaculate Water;
        the inverted boat floats across. The mind which wandered in external
        distractions is restrained and held in check; the Gurmukh is intuitively
        absorbed in God.  || 4 ||   He is a householder, he is a renunciate
        and God's slave, who, as Gurmukh, realizes his own self.
        Says Nanak, his mind is pleased and appeased by the True Word
        of the Shabad; there is no other at all.  || 5 || 17 || <br>

      <p> || 1 ||   Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O Siblings of
        Destiny. By Guru's Grace, the mind becomes steady and stable;
        night and day, it remains satisfied with the Sublime Essence of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Night and day, perform devotional
        worship service to the Lord, day and night; this is the profit
        to be obtained in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O Siblings of Destiny.
        The humble beings are forever immaculate; no filth ever sticks
        to them. They focus their consciousness on the True Name.  ||
        2 ||   The True Guru has revealed the ornamentation of peace;
        the Glorious Greatness of the Naam is Great! The Inexhaustible
        Treasures are overflowing; they are never exhausted. So serve
        the Lord forever, O Siblings of Destiny.  || 3 ||   The Creator
        comes to abide in the minds of those whom He Himself has blessed.
        O Nanak, meditate forever on the Naam, which the True Guru has
        revealed.  || 4 || 1 ||   PRABHAATEE,  THIRD MEHL:  I am unworthy;
        please forgive me and bless me, O my Lord and Master, and unite
        me with Yourself. You are Endless; no one can find Your limits.
        Through the Word of Your Shabad, You bestow understanding.  ||
        1 ||   O Dear Lord, I am a sacrifice to You. I dedicate my mind
        and body and place them in offering before You; I shall remain
        in Your Sanctuary forever.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Please keep me
        forever under Your Will, O my Lord and Master; please bless me
        with the Glorious Greatness of Your Name. Through the Perfect
        Guru, God's Will is revealed; night and day, remain absorbed
        in peace and poise.  || 2 ||   Those devotees who accept Your
        Will are pleasing to You, Lord; You Yourself forgive them, and
        unite them with Yourself. Accepting Your Will, I have found everlasting
        peace; the Guru has extinguished the fire of desire.  || 3 ||
        Whatever You do comes to pass, O Creator; nothing else can be
        done. O Nanak, nothing is as great as the Blessing of the Name;
        it is obtained through the Perfect Guru.  || 4 || 2 ||   PRABHAATEE,
        THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukhs praise the Lord; praising the Lord,
        they know Him. Doubt and duality are gone from within; they realize
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord,
        You are my One and Only. I meditate on You and praise You; salvation
        and wisdom come from You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Gurmukhs praise
        You; they receive the most excellent and sweet Ambrosial Nectar.
        This Nectar is forever sweet; it never loses its taste. Contemplate
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 2 ||   He makes it seem
        so sweet to me; I am a sacrifice to Him. Through the Shabad, I
        praise the Giver of peace forever. I have eradicated self-conceit
        from within.  || 3 ||   My True Guru is forever the Giver. I receive
        whatever fruits and rewards I desire. O Nanak, through the Naam,
        glorious greatness is obtained; through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, the True One is found.  || 4 || 3 ||   PRABHAATEE,  THIRD

        Great as You. There never was, and there never shall be.  || 1
        ||   O Dear Lord, I shall remain in Your Sanctuary forever. As
        it pleases You, You save me, O my Lord and Master; this is Your

      <p> O Dear Lord, the Messenger of Death cannot even touch those whom
        You, in Your Mercy, protect.  || 2 ||   True Is Your Sanctuary,
        O Dear Lord; it never diminishes or goes away. Those who abandon
        the Lord, and become attached to the love of duality, shall continue
        to die and be reborn.  || 3 ||   Those who seek Your Sanctuary,
        Dear Lord, shall never suffer in pain or hunger for anything.
        O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord forever, and merge
        in the True Word of the Shabad.  || 4 || 4 ||   PRABHAATEE,  THIRD
        MEHL:  As Gurmukh, meditate on the Dear Lord forever, as long
        as there is the breath of life. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, the mind becomes immaculate, and egotistical pride is
        expelled from the mind. Fruitful and prosperous is the life of
        that mortal being, who is absorbed in the Name of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||   O my mind, listen to the Teachings of the Guru. The Name
        of the Lord is the Giver of peace forever. With intuitive ease,
        drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Those who understand their own origin dwell within the home
        of their inner being, in intuitive peace and poise. Through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, the heart-lotus blossoms forth,
        and egotism and evil-mindedness are eradicated. The One True Lord
        is pervading amongst all; those who realize this are very rare.
        || 2 ||   Through the Guru's Teachings, the mind becomes
        immaculate, speaking the Ambrosial Essence. The Name of the Lord
        dwells in the mind forever; within the mind, the mind is pleased
        and appeased. I am forever a sacrifice to my Guru, through whom
        I have realized the Lord, the Supreme Soul.  || 3 ||   Those human
        beings who do not serve the True Guru - their lives are
        uselessly wasted. When God bestows His Glance of Grace, then we
        meet the True Guru, merging in intuitive peace and poise. O Nanak,
        by great good fortune, the Naam is bestowed; by perfect destiny,
        meditate.  || 4 || 5 ||   PRABHAATEE,  THIRD MEHL:  God Himself
        fashioned the many forms and colors; He created the Universe and
        staged the play. Creating the creation, He watches over it. He
        acts, and causes all to act; He gives sustenance to all beings.
        || 1 ||   In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord is All-pervading.
        The One God is pervading and permeating each and every heart;
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is revealed to the Gurmukh.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is hidden, but
        it is pervasive in the Dark Age. The Lord is totally pervading
        and permeating each and every heart. The Jewel of the Naam is
        revealed within the hearts of those who hurry to the Sanctuary
        of the Guru.  || 2 ||   Whoever overpowers the five sense organs,
        is blessed with forgiveness, patience and contentment, through
        the Guru's Teachings. Blessed, blessed, perfect and great
        is that humble servant of the Lord, who is inspired by the Fear
        of God and detached love, to sing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord.  || 3 ||   If someone turns his face away from the Guru,
        and does not enshrine the Guru's Words in his consciousness
        - he may perform all sorts of rituals and accumulate wealth,
        but in the end, he will fall into hell.  || 4 ||   The One Shabad,
        the Word of the One God, is prevailing everywhere. All the creation
        came from the One Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukh is united in union.
        When the Gurmukh goes, he blends into the Lord, Har, Har.  ||
        5 || 6 ||   PRABHAATEE,  THIRD MEHL:  O my mind, praise your Guru. <br>

      <p> Perfect destiny is inscribed upon your forehead and face; sing
        the Praises of the Lord forever.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord
        bestows the Ambrosial Food of the Naam. Out of millions, only
        a rare few receive it - only those who are blessed by God's
        Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||   Whoever enshrines the Guru's
        Feet within his mind, is rid of pain and darkness from within.
        The True Lord unites him with Himself.  || 2 ||   So embrace love
        for the Word of the Guru's Bani. Here and hereafter, this
        is your only Support. The Creator Lord Himself bestows it.  ||
        3 ||   One whom the Lord inspires to accept His Will, is a wise
        and knowing devotee. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to him.  ||

        upon the Sermon of the Lord. My God has infused this longing within
        me; I seek my Lord God.  || 1 ||   My mind is the dust of the

        Lord, Har, Har, within me. I dust the Guru's Feet with
        my hair.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Dark are the days and nights of

        to Maya. The Lord God does not dwell in their hearts, even for

        The Sublime Essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is enshrined

        I have meditated on the Lord in an instant.  || 4 || 3 ||   PRABHAATEE,
        FOURTH MEHL:  God, the Inaccessible and Merciful, has showered
        me with His Mercy; I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with

        sinners; I am rid of all the residues of my sins and mistakes.
        || 1 ||   O mind, chant the Name of the All-pervading Lord. I

        of pain. Following the Guru's Teachings, I gather in the
        Wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The Lord abides in the body-village; through the Wisdom of the
        Guru's Teachings, the Lord, Har, Har, is revealed. In the
        lake of the body, the Lord's Name has been revealed. Within

        it wanders and roams around, searching for it in the bushes. 
        || 3 ||   You are Great and Unfathomable; Your Wisdom, God, is
        Profound and Incomprehensible. Please bless me with that wisdom,
        by which I might attain You, O Lord God. The Guru has placed His
        Hand upon servant Nanak; he chants the Name of the Lord.  || 4

        The Word of the True Guru has become pleasing to my heart. The
        Lord God has showered me with His Grace.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        vibrate and meditate on the Lord's Name every instant.

        my home and mansion. As Gurmukh, I meditate on His Glory. Here
        and hereafter, the Lord's humble servants are embellished
        and exalted; their faces are radiant; as Gurmukh, they are carried
        across.  || 2 ||   I am lovingly attuned to the Fearless Lord,
        Har, Har, Har; through the Guru, I have enshrined the Lord within
        my heart in an instant. Millions upon millions of the faults and
        mistakes of the Lord's humble servant are all taken away

      <p> O Nanak, the Lord God and His servant are one and the same.  ||
        4 || 5 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Guru, the True Guru,
        has implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord within me. I was
        dead, but chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have been
        brought back to life. Blessed, blessed is the Guru, the Guru,
        the Perfect True Guru; He reached out to me with His Arm, and
        pulled me up and out of the ocean of poison.  || 1 ||   O mind,
        meditate and worship the Lord's Name. God is never found,
        even by making all sorts of new efforts. The Lord God is obtained
        only through the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Sublime
        Essence of the Lord's Name is the source of nectar and
        bliss; drinking in this Sublime Essence, following the Guru's
        Teachings, I have become happy. Even iron slag is transformed
        into gold, joining the Lord's Congregation. Through the
        Guru, the Lord's Light is enshrined within the heart. 
        || 2 ||   Those who are continually lured by greed, egotism and
        corruption, who are lured away by emotional attachment to their
        children and spouse - they never serve at the feet of the
        Saints; those self-willed manmukhs are filled with ashes.  ||
        3 ||   O God, You alone know Your Glorious Virtues; I have grown
        weary - I seek Your Sanctuary. As You know best, You preserve
        and protect me, O my Lord and Master; servant Nanak is Your slave.

        be your Helper and Support there, where no one else can help you.
