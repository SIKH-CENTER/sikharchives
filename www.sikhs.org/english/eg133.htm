      <p> <font color="#000000">O Primal Lord God, You Yourself are the Creator,
        the Cause of all causes. You are All-pervading everywhere, totally
        filling all hearts. You are seen pervading the world; who can
        know Your State? You protect all; You are our Lord and Master.
        O my Imperishable and Formless Lord, You formed Yourself. You
        are the One and Only; no one else is like You. O Lord, You have
        no end or limitation. Who can contemplate You? You are the Father
        of the world, the Support of all life. Your devotees are at Your
        Door, O God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak
        describe them with only one tongue? I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them.  || 1 ||
        Streams of Ambrosial Nectar flow; Your Treasures are unweighable
        and overflowing in abundance. You are the Farthest of the far,
        Infinite and Incomparably Beautiful. You do whatever You please;
        You do not take advice from anyone else. In Your Home, creation
        and destruction happen in an instant. No one else is equal to
        You; Your Light is Immaculate and Pure. Millions of sins are washed
        away, chanting Your Name, Har, Har. Your devotees are at Your
        Door, God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak
        describe them with only one tongue? I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them.  || 2 ||
        You established all the worlds from within Yourself, and extended
        them outward. You are All-pervading amongst all, and yet You Yourself
        remain detached. O Lord, there is no end or limit to Your Glorious
        Virtues; all beings and creatures are Yours. You are the Giver
        of all, the One Invisible Lord. <br>

      <p> He Himself supports the Universe, revealing His All-powerful Creative
        Potency. He has no color, form, mouth or beard. Your devotees
        are at Your Door, O God - they are just like You. How can
        servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue? I am a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to
        them.  || 3 ||   You are the Treasure of all virtue; who can know
        the value of Your spiritual wisdom and meditation? O God, Your
        Place is known as the highest of the high. Mind, wealth and the
        breath of life belong to You alone, Lord. The world is strung
        upon Your Thread. What praises can I give to You? You are the
        Greatest of the great. Who can know Your Mystery? O Unfathomable,
        Infinite, Divine Lord, Your Power is unstoppable. O God, You are
        the Support of all. Your devotees are at Your Door, O God -
        they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with
        only one tongue? I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a
        sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them.  || 4 ||   O Formless,
        Formed, Undeceivable, Perfect, Imperishable, Unchanging, Blissful,
        Unlimited, Beautiful, Immaculate, Blossoming Lord: Countless are
        those who sing Your Glorious Praises, but they do not know even
        a tiny bit of Your extent. That humble being upon whom You shower
        Your Mercy meets with You, O God. Blessed, blessed, blessed are
        those humble beings, upon whom the Lord, Har, Har, showers His
        Mercy. Whoever meets with the Lord through Guru Nanak is rid of
        both birth and death.  || 5 ||   The Lord is said to be True,
        True, True, True, the Truest of the True. There is no other like
        Him. He is the Primal Being, the Primal Soul. Chanting the Ambrosial
        Name of the Lord, the mortal is blessed with all comforts. Those
        who taste it with their tongues, those humble beings are satisfied
        and fulfilled. That person who becomes pleasing to his Lord and
        Master, loves the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Whoever meets
        with the Lord through Guru Nanak, saves all his generations. 
        || 6 ||   True is His Congregation and His Court. The True Lord
        has established Truth. Sitting upon His Throne of Truth, He administers
        True Justice. The True Lord Himself fashioned the Universe. He
        is Infallible, and does not make mistakes. The Naam, the Name
        of the Infinite Lord, is the jewel. Its value cannot be appraised
        - it is priceless. That person, upon whom the Lord of the
        Universe showers His Mercy obtains all comforts. Those who touch
        the Feet of the Lord through Guru Nanak, do not have to enter
        the cycle of reincarnation ever again.  || 7 ||   What is the
        Yoga, what is the spiritual wisdom and meditation, and what is
        the way, to praise the Lord? The Siddhas and seekers and the thirty-three
        million gods cannot find even a tiny bit of the Lord's
        Value. Neither Brahma, nor Sanak, nor the thousand-headed serpent
        king can find the limits of His Glorious Virtues. The Inapprehensible
        Lord cannot be apprehended. He is pervading and permeating amongst
        all. Those whom God has mercifully freed from their nooses -
        those humble beings are attached to His devotional worship. Those
        who meet with the Lord through Guru Nanak are liberated forever,
        here and hereafter.  || 8 ||   I am a beggar; I seek the Sanctuary
        of God, the Giver of givers. Please bless me with the gift of
        the dust of the feet of the Saints; grasping them, I cross over
        the terrifying world-ocean. <br>

          and Master. My mind yearns for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
          This mind abides in devotional worship. The lamp is lit in the
          darkness; all are saved in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, through
          the One Name and faith in the Dharma. The Lord is revealed in
          all the worlds. O servant Nanak, the Guru is the Supreme Lord
          God.  || 9 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">This body is frail and transitory, and bound
        to emotional attachment. I am foolish, stone-hearted, filthy and
        unwise. My mind wanders and wobbles, and will not hold steady.
        It does not know the state of the Supreme Lord God. I am intoxicated
        with the wine of youth, beauty and the riches of Maya. I wander
        around perplexed, in excessive egotistical pride. The wealth and
        women of others, arguments and slander, are sweet and dear to
        my soul. I try to hide my deception, but God, the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of Hearts, sees and hears all. I have no humility,
        faith, compassion or purity, but I seek Your Sanctuary, O Giver
        of life. The All-powerful Lord is the Cause of causes. O Lord
        and Master of Nanak, please save me!  || 1 ||   The Praises of
        the Creator, the Enticer of the mind, are potent to destroy sins.
        The All-powerful Lord is the boat, to carry us across; He saves
        all our generations. O my unconscious mind, contemplate and remember
        Him in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Why are you wandering
        around, enticed by the darkness of doubt? Remember Him in meditation,
        for an hour, for a moment, even for an instant. Chant the Name
        of the Lord with your tongue. You are bound to worthless deeds
        and shallow pleasures; why do you spend millions of lifetimes
        wandering in such pain? Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord,
        O Nanak, through the Teachings of the Saints. Meditate on the
        Lord with love in your soul.  || 2 ||   The little sperm is planted
        in the body-field of the mother, and the human body, so difficult
        to obtain, is formed. He eats and drinks, and enjoys pleasures;
        his pains are taken away, and his suffering is gone. He is given
        the understanding to recognize mother, father, siblings and relatives.
        He grows day by day, as the horrible specter of old age comes
        closer and closer. You worthless, petty worm of Maya -
        remember your Lord and Master, at least for an instant! Please
        take Nanak's hand, O Merciful Ocean of Mercy, and take
        away this heavy load of doubt.  || 3 ||   O mind, you are a mouse,
        living in the mousehole of the body; you are so proud of yourself,
        but you act like an absolute fool. You swing in the swing of wealth,
        intoxicated with Maya, and you wander around like an owl. You
        take pleasure in your children, spouse, friends and relatives;
        your emotional attachment to them is increasing. You have planted
        the seeds of egotism, and the sprout of possessiveness has come
        up. You pass your life making sinful mistakes. The cat of death,
        with his mouth wide-open, is watching you. You eat food, but you
        are still hungry. Meditate in remembrance on the Merciful Lord
        of the World, O Nanak, in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. <br>

      <p> Know that the world is just a dream.  || 4 ||   Neither body,
        nor house, nor love last forever. You are intoxicated with Maya;
        how long will you be proud of them? Neither crown, nor canopy,
        nor servants last forever. You do not consider in your heart that
        your life is passing away. Neither chariots, nor horses, nor elephants
        or royal thrones shall last forever. In an instant, you will have
        to leave them, and depart naked. Neither warrior, nor hero, nor
        king or ruler last forever; see this with your eyes. Neither fortress,
        nor shelter, nor treasure will save you; doing evil deeds, you
        shall depart empty-handed. Friends, children, spouses and friends
        - none of them last forever; they change like the shade
        of a tree. God is the Perfect Primal Being, Merciful to the meek;
        each and every instant, meditate in remembrance on Him, the Inaccessible
        and Infinite. O Great Lord and Master, servant Nanak seeks Your
        Sanctuary; please shower him with Your Mercy, and carry him across.
        || 5 ||   I have used up my breath of life, sold my self-respect,
        begged for charity, committed highway robbery, and dedicated my
        consciousness to the love and pursuit of acquiring wealth. I have
        kept it secretly hidden from my friends, relatives, companions,
        children and siblings. I ran around practicing falsehood, burning
        up my body and growing old. I gave up good deeds, righteousness
        and Dharma, self-discipline, purity, religious vows and all good
        ways; I associated with the fickle Maya. Beasts and birds, trees
        and mountains - in so many ways, I wandered lost in reincarnation.
        I did not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, for a moment,
        or even an instant. He is the Master of the meek, the Lord of
        all life. The food and drink, and the sweet and tasty dishes became
        totally bitter at the last moment. O Nanak, I was saved in the
        Society of the Saints, at their feet; the others, intoxicated
        with Maya, have gone, leaving everything behind.  || 6 ||   Brahma,
        Shiva, the Vedas and the silent sages sing the Glorious Praises
        of their Lord and Master with love and delight. Indra, Vishnu
        and Gorakh, who come to earth and then go to heaven again, seek
        the Lord. The Siddhas, human beings, gods and demons cannot find
        even a tiny bit of His Mystery. The Lord's humble servants
        are imbued with love and affection for God their Beloved; in the
        delight of devotional worship, they are absorbed in the Blessed
        Vision of His Darshan. But those who forsake Him, and beg from
        another, shall see their mouths, teeth and tongues wear away.
        O my foolish mind, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, the Giver
        of peace. Slave Nanak imparts these teachings.  || 7 ||   The
        pleasures of Maya shall fade away. In doubt, the mortal falls
        into the deep dark pit of emotional attachment. He is so proud,
        even the sky cannot contain him. His belly is filled with manure,
        bones and worms. He runs around in the ten directions, for the
        sake of the great poison of corruption. He steals the wealth of
        others, and in the end, he is destroyed by his own ignorance.
        His youth passes away, the illnesses of old age seize him, and
        the Messenger of Death punishes him; such is the death he dies.
        He suffers the agony of hell in countless incarnations; he rots
        away in the pit of pain and condemnation. O Nanak, those whom
        the Saint mercifully takes as his own, are carried across by their
        loving devotional worship.  || 8 ||   All virtues are obtained,
        all fruits and rewards, and the desires of the mind; my hopes
        have been totally fulfilled. <br>

      <p> The Medicine, the Mantra, the Magic Charm, will cure all illnesses
        and totally take away all pain. Lust, anger, egotism, jealousy
        and desire are eliminated by chanting the Name of the Lord. The
        merits of cleansing baths, charity, penance, purity and good deeds,
        are obtained by enshrining the Lotus Feet of God within the heart.
        The Lord is my Friend, my Very Best Friend, Companion and Relative.
        God is the Sustenance of the soul, the Support of the breath of
        life. I have grasped the Shelter and Support of my All-powerful
        Lord and Master; slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him.  ||
        9 ||   Weapons cannot cut that person who delights in the love
        of the Lord's Lotus Feet. Ropes cannot bind that person
        whose mind is pierced through by the Vision of the Lord's
        Way. Fire cannot burn that person who is attached to the dust
        of the feet of the Lord's humble servant. Water cannot
        drown that person whose feet walk on the Lord's Path. O
        Nanak, diseases, faults, sinful mistakes and emotional attachment
        are pierced by the Arrow of the Name.  || 1 || 10 ||   People
        are engaged in making all sorts of efforts; they contemplate the
        various aspects of the six Shaastras. Rubbing ashes all over their
        bodies, they wander around at the various sacred shrines of pilgrimage;
        they fast until their bodies are emaciated, and braid their hair
        into tangled messes. Without devotional worship of the Lord, they
        all suffer in pain, caught in the tangled web of their love. They
        perform worship ceremonies, draw ritual marks on their bodies,
        cook their own food fanatically, and make pompous shows of themselves
        in all sorts of ways.  ||2 || 11 || 20 || <br>

        of sins, the sacred pool of the Shabad, the Word of God. The beings

      <p> Kal the poet sings the Sublime Praises of Guru Nanak, who enjoys
        mastery of Raja Yoga.  || 4 ||   The four castes and the six Shaastras
        sing His Glorious Praises; Brahma and the others contemplate His
        Virtues. The thousand-tongued serpent king sings His Praises with
        delight, remaining lovingly attached to Him. Shiva, detached and

        the Lord's endless meditation. Kal the poet sings the Sublime
        Praises of Guru Nanak, who enjoys mastery of Raja Yoga.  || 5
        ||   He mastered Raja Yoga, and enjoys sovereignty over both worlds;
        the Lord, beyond hate and revenge, is enshrined within His Heart.
        The whole world is saved, and carried across, chanting the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Sanak and Janak and the others sing His
        Praises, age after age. Blessed, blessed, blessed and fruitful
        is the sublime birth of the Guru into the world. Even in the nether
        regions, His Victory is celebrated; so says Kal the poet. You
        are blessed with the Nectar of the Lord's Name, O Guru
        Nanak; You have mastered Raja Yoga, and enjoy sovereignty over
        both worlds.  || 6 ||   In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, You deceived
        Baal the king. In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, You were called
        Raam of the Raghu dynasty. In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, You
        were Krishna; You killed Mur the demon and saved Kans. You blessed
        Ugrasain with a kingdom, and You blessed Your humble devotees
        with fearlessness. In the Iron Age, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga,
        You are known and accepted as Guru Nanak, Guru Angad and Guru
        Amar Das. The sovereign rule of the Great Guru is unchanging and
        permanent, according the Command of the Primal Lord God.  || 7
        ||   His Glorious Praises are sung by the devotees Ravi Daas,
        Jai Dayv and Trilochan. The devotees Naam Dayv and Kabeer praise
        Him continually, knowing Him to be even-eyed. The devotee Baynee
        sings His Praises; He intuitively enjoys the ecstasy of the soul.
        He is the Master of Yoga and meditation, and the spiritual wisdom
        of the Guru; He knows none other except God. Sukh Dayv and Preekhyat
        sing His Praises, and Gautam the rishi sings His Praise. Says
        Kal the poet, the ever-fresh praises of Guru Nanak are spread
        throughout the world.  || 8 ||   In the nether worlds, His Praises
        are sung by the devotees like Shaysh-naag in serpent form. Shiva,
        the Yogis and the wandering hermits sing His Praises forever.
        Vyaas the silent sage sings His Praise, contemplating the subtleties
        of the Vedas. His Praises are sung by Brahma, who created the
        entire universe by God's Command. God fills the galaxies
        and realms of the universe; He is known to be the same, manifest
        and unmanifest. Kal chants the Sublime Praises of Guru Nanak,
        who enjoys mastery of Yoga.  || 9 ||   The nine masters of Yoga

        his guru, sings His Praises. Doorbaasaa, King Puro and Angra sing
        the Praises of Guru Nanak. Says Kal the poet, the Sublime Praises
        of Guru Nanak intuitively permeate each and every heart.  || 10

      <p> <font color="#000000">Blessed is the Primal Lord God, the Creator,
        the All-powerful Cause of causes. Blessed is the True Guru Nanak,
        who placed His hand upon Your forehead. When He placed His hand
        upon Your forehead, then the celestial nectar began to rain down
        in torrents; the gods and human beings, heavenly heralds and sages
        were drenched in its fragrance. You challenged and subdued the
        cruel demon of death; You restrained Your wandering mind; You
        overpowered the five demons and You keep them in one home. Through
        the Guru's Door, the Gurdwara, You have conquered the world;
        You play the game even-handedly. You keep the flow of your love
        steady for the Formless Lord. O Kal, chant the Praises of Lehnaa
        throughout the seven continents; He met with the Lord, and became
        Guru of the World.  || 1 ||   The Stream of Ambrosial Nectar from
        His eyes washes away the slime and filth of sins; the sight of
        His door dispels the darkness of ignorance. Whoever accomplishes
        this most difficult task of contemplating the most sublime Word
        of the Shabad - those people cross over the terrifying
        world-ocean, and cast off their loads of sin. The Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, is celestial and sublime; whoever remains
        awake and aware, contemplating the Guru, embodies humility, and
        is imbued forever with the Supreme Love of the Lord. O Kal, chant
        the Praises of Lehnaa throughout the seven continents; He met
        with the Lord, and became Guru of the World.  || 2 ||   You hold
        tight to the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord; Your expanse
        is immaculate. You are the Support of the Siddhas and seekers,
        and the good and humble beings. You are the incarnation of King
        Janak; the contemplation of Your Shabad is sublime throughout
        the universe. You abide in the world like the lotus on the water.
        Like the Elyisan Tree, You cure all illnesses and take away the
        sufferings of the world. The three-phased soul is lovingly attuned
        to You alone. O Kal, chant the Praises of Lehnaa throughout the
        seven continents; He met with the Lord, and became Guru of the
        World.  || 3 ||   You were blessed with glory by the Prophet;
        You serve the Guru, certified by the Lord, who has subdued the
        snake of the mind, and who abides in the state of sublime bliss.
        Your Vision is like that of the Lord, Your soul is a fount of
        spiritual wisdom; You know the unfathomable state of the certified
        Guru. Your Gaze is focused upon the unmoving, unchanging place.
        Your Intellect is immaculate; it is focused upon the most sublime
        place. Wearing the armor of humility, you have overcome Maya.
        O Kal, chant the Praises of Lehnaa throughout the seven continents;
        He met with the Lord, and became Guru of the World.  || 4 || 
        Casting Your Glance of Grace, you dispel the darkness, burn away
        evil, and destroy sin. You are the Heroic Warrior of the Shabad,
        the Word of God. Your Power destroys sexual desire and anger.
        You have overpowered greed and emotional attachment; You nurture
        and cherish those who seek Your Sanctuary. You gather in the joyful
        love of the soul; Your Words have the Potency to bring forth Ambrosial
        Nectar. You are appointed the True Guru, the True Guru in this
        Dark Age of Kali Yuga; whoever is truly attached to You is carried

      <p> The lion, the son of Pheru, is Guru Angad, the Guru of the World;
        Lehnaa practices Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success.
        || 5 ||   Your mind remains lovingly attuned to the Lord forever;
        You do whatever you desire. Like the tree heavy with fruit, You
        bow in humility, and endure the pain of it; You are pure of thought.
        You realize this reality, that the Lord is All-pervading, Unseen
        and Amazing. With intuitive ease, You send forth the rays of the
        Ambrosial Word of power. You have risen to the state of the certified
        Guru; you grasp truth and contentment. Kal proclaims, that whoever
        attains the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of Lehnaa, meets with
        the Lord.  || 6 ||   My mind has faith, that the Prophet has given
        You access to the Profound Lord. Your body has been purged of
        the deadly poison; You drink the Ambrosial Nectar deep within.
        Your Heart has blossomed forth in awareness of the Unseen Lord,
        who has infused His Power throughout the ages. O True Guru, You
        are intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi, with continuity and equality.
        You are open-minded and large-hearted, the Destroyer of poverty;
        seeing You, sins are afraid. Says Kal, I lovingly, continually,
        intuitively chant the Praises of Lehnaa with my tongue.  || 7
        ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is our medicine; the Naam
        is our support; the Naam is the peace of Samaadhi. The Naam is
        the insignia which embellishes us forever. Kal is imbued with
        the Love of the Naam, the Naam which is the fragrance of gods
        and human beings. Whoever obtains the Naam, the Philosopher's
        Stone, becomes the embodiment of Truth, manifest and radiant throughout
        the world. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's
        Darshan, it is as if one has bathed at the sixty-eight sacred
        shrines of pilgrimage.  || 8 ||   The True Name is the sacred
        shrine, the True Name is the cleansing bath of purification and
        food. The True Name is eternal love; chant the True Name, and
        be embellished. The True Name is obtained through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad; the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, is
        fragrant with the True Name. Kal the poet utters the Praises of
        the one whose self-discipline is the True Name, and whose fast
        is the True Name. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's
        Darshan, one's life is approved and certified in the True
        Name.  || 9 ||   When You bestow Your Ambrosial Glance of Grace,
        You eradicate all wickedness, sin and filth. Sexual desire, anger,
        greed and emotional attachment - You have overcome all
        these powerful passions. Your mind is filled with peace forever;
        You banish the sufferings of the world. The Guru is the river
        of the nine treasures, washing off the dirt of our lives. So speaks
        Tal the poet: serve the Guru, day and night, with intuitive love
        and affection. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru, the
        pains of death and rebirth are taken away.  || 10 || <br>

        He established Lehnaa as Guru, who was imbued with all supernatural

      <p> In the north, south, east and west, people proclaim Your Victory.
        The Guru spoke the Lord's Name with His mouth and broadcast
        it throughout the world, to turn the tide of the hearts of men.
        That Undeceivable Naam, which carries the devotees across the
        world-ocean, came into Guru Amar Daas.  || 1 ||   The gods and
        heavenly heralds, the Siddhas and seekers and Shiva in Samaadhi
        meditate in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The
        stars and the realms of Dhroo, and devotees like Naaraad and Prahlaad
        meditate on the Naam. The moon and the sun long for the Naam;
        it has saved even mountain ranges. That Undeceivable Naam, which
        carries the devotees across the world-ocean, came into Guru Amar
        Daas.  || 2 ||   Dwelling upon that Immaculate Naam, the nine
        Yogic masters, Shiva and Sanak and many others have been emancipated.
        The eighty-four Siddhas, the beings of supernatural spiritual
        powers, and the Buddhas are imbued with the Naam; it carried Ambreek
        across the terrifying world-ocean. It has erased the sinful residues
        of past mistakes of Oodho, Akroor, Trilochan, Naam Dayv and Kabeer,
        in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. That Undeceivable Naam, which carries
        the devotees across the world-ocean, came into Guru Amar Daas.
        || 3 ||   The thirty-three million angels meditate, attached
        to the Naam; it is enshrined within the minds of the celibates
        and ascetics. Bhisham Pitama, the son of the Ganges, meditated
        on that Naam; his consciousness delighted in the Ambrosial Nectar
        of the Lord's Feet. The great and profound Guru has brought
        forth the Naam; accepting the teachings as true, the Holy Congregation
        has been saved. That Undeceivable Naam, which carries the devotees
        across the world-ocean, came into Guru Amar Daas.  || 4 ||   The
        Glory of the Naam shines forth, like the rays of the sun, and
        the branches of the Elysian Tree. In the countries of the north,
        south, east and west, the Praises of the Naam are chanted. Life
        is fruitful, when the Name of the Lord abides in the heart. The
        angelic beings, heavenly heralds, celestial singers and the six
        Shaastras yearn for the Naam. The son of Tayj Bhaan of the Bhalla
        dynasty is noble and famous; with his palms pressed together,
        Kal meditates on Him. The Naam takes away the fears of the devotees
        about the word-ocean; Guru Amar Daas has obtained it.  || 5 ||
        The thirty-one million gods meditate on the Naam, along with
        the Siddhas and seekers; the Naam supports solar systems and galaxies.
        One who meditates on the Naam in Samaadhi, endures sorrow and
        joy as one and the same. The Naam is the most sublime of all;
        the devotees remain lovingly attuned to it. Guru Amar Daas was
        blessed with the treasure of the Naam, by the Creator Lord, in
        His Pleasure.  || 6 ||   He is the Warrior Hero of Truth, humility
        is His Power. His Loving Nature inspires the Congregation with
        deep and profound understanding; He is absorbed in the Lord, free
        of hate and vengeance. Patience has been His white banner since
        the beginning of time, planted on the bridge to heaven. The Saints
        meet their Beloved Guru, who is united with the Creator Lord.
        Serving the True Guru, they find peace; Guru Amar Daas has given
        them this ability.  || 7 ||   The Naam is His cleansing bath;
        the Naam is the food He eats; the Naam is the taste He enjoys.
        With deep yearning, He chants the Sweet Bani of the Guru's
        Word forever. Blessed is service to the True Guru; by His Grace,
        the State of the Unfathomable Lord is known. All Your generations
        are totally saved; You dwell in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. <br>

      <p> So speaks Kal: fruitful is the life of one who meets with Guru
        Amar Daas, radiant with the Light of God.  || 8 ||   On His right
        hand is the sign of the lotus; the Siddhis, the supernatural spiritual
        powers, await His Command. On His left are worldly powers, which
        fascinate the three worlds. The Inexpressible Lord abides in His
        Heart; He alone knows this joy. Guru Amar Daas utters the words
        of devotion, imbued with the Love of the Lord. On His forehead
        is the true insignia of the Lord's Mercy; with his palms
        pressed together, Kal meditates on Him. Whoever meets with the
        Guru, the certified True Guru, has all his desires fulfilled.
        || 9 ||   Supremely fruitful are the feet which walk upon the
        path of Guru Amar Daas. Supremely fruitful are the hands which
        touch the feet of Guru Amar Daas. Supremely fruitful is the tongue
        which utters the praises of Guru Amar Daas. Supremely fruitful
        are the eyes which behold Guru Amar Daas. Supremely fruitful are
        the ears which hear the Praises of Guru Amar Daas. Fruitful is
        the heart in which Guru Amar Daas, the Father of the world, Himself
        abides. Fruitful is the head, says Jaalap, which bows forever
        before Guru Amar Daas.  || 1 || 10 ||   They do not suffer pain
        or hunger, and they cannot be called poor. They do not grieve,
        and their limits cannot be found. They do not serve anyone else,
        but they give gifts to hundreds and thousands. They sit on beautiful
        carpets; they establish and disestablish at will. They find peace
        in this world, and live fearlessly amidst their enemies. They
        are fruitful and prosperous, says Jaalap. Guru Amar Daas is pleased
        with them.  || 2 || 11 ||   You read about the One Lord, and enshrine
        Him in Your mind; You realize the One and Only Lord. With Your
        eyes and the words You speak, You dwell upon the One Lord; You
        do not know any other place of rest. You know the One Lord while
        dreaming, and the One Lord while awake. You are absorbed in the
        One. At the age of seventy-one, You began to march towards the
        Indestructible Lord. The One Lord, who takes hundreds of thousands
        of forms, cannot be seen. He can only be described as One. So
        speaks Jaalap: O Guru Amar Daas, You long for the One Lord, and
        believe in the One Lord alone.  || 3 || 12 ||   The understanding
        which Jai Dayv grasped, the understanding which permeated Naam
        Dayv, the understanding which was in the consciousness of Trilochan
        and known by the devotee Kabeer, by which Rukmaangad constantly
        meditated on the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, which brought Ambreek
        and Prahlaad to seek the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe,
        and which brought them to salvation - that sublime understanding
        has brought You to renounce greed, anger and desire, and to know
        the way. Guru Amar Daas is the Lord's own devotee; gazing
        upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, one is liberated.  ||
        4 || 13 ||   Meeting with Guru Amar Daas, the earth is purged
        of its sin. The Siddhas and seekers long to meet with Guru Amar
        Daas. Meeting with Guru Amar Daas, the mortal meditates on the
        Lord, and his journey comes to its end. <br>

        One Lord, love of duality ceases, and one comes to accept the
        Sublime Mantra of the Guru. So speaks Jaalap: countless treasures
        are obtained, by the sight of Guru Amar Daas.  || 5 || 14 || 
        Guru Nanak gathered up the True Name of the Creator Lord, and
        implanted it within. Through Him, Lehnaa became manifest in the
        form of Guru Angad, who remained lovingly attuned to His Feet.
        Guru Amar Daas of that dynasty is the home of hope. How can I
        express His Glorious Virtues? His Virtues are unknowable and unfathomable.
        I do not know the limits of His Virtues. The Creator, the Architect
        of Destiny, has made Him a boat to carry all His generations across,
        along with the Sangat, the Holy Congregation. So speaks Keerat:
        O Guru Amar Daas, please protect me and save me; I seek the Sanctuary
        of Your Feet.  || 1 || 15 ||   The Lord Himself wielded His Power
        and entered the world. The Formless Lord took form, and with His
        Light He illuminated the realms of the world. He is All-pervading
        everywhere; the Lamp of the Shabad, the Word, has been lit. Whoever
        gathers in the essence of the teachings shall be absorbed in the
        Feet of the Lord. Lehnaa, who became Guru Angad, and Guru Amar
        Daas, have been reincarnated into the pure house of Guru Nanak.
        Guru Amar Daas is our Saving Grace, who carries us across; in
        lifetime after lifetime, I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet.  ||
        2 || 16 ||   Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, the
        Gursikh is blessed with chanting and deep meditation, truth and
        contentment. Whoever seeks His Sanctuary is saved; his account
        is cleared in the City of Death. His heart is totally filled with
        loving devotion; he chants to the Creator Lord. The Guru is the
        river of pearls; in an instant, he carries the drowning ones across.
        He was reincarnated into the House of Guru Nanak; He chants the
        Glorious Praises of the Creator Lord. Those who serve Guru Amar
        Daas - their pains and poverty are taken away, far away.
        || 3 || 17 ||   I consciously pray within my consciousness, but
        I cannot express it in words. I place all my worries and anxieties
        before You; I look to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        for help. By the Hukam of Your Command, I am blessed with Your
        Insignia; I serve my Lord and Master. When You, O Guru, gaze at
        me with Your Glance of Grace, the fruit of the Naam, the Name
        of the Creator, is placed within my mouth. The Unfathomable and
        Unseen Primal Lord God, the Cause of causes - as He orders,
        so do I speak. O Guru Amar Daas, Doer of deeds, Cause of causes,
        as You keep me, I remain; as You protect me, I survive.  || 4
        || 18 ||   OF BHIKHAA:  In deep meditation, and the spiritual
        wisdom of the Guru, one's essence merges with the essence
        of reality. In truth, the True Lord is recognized and realized,
        when one is lovingly attuned to Him, with one-pointed consciousness.
        Lust and anger are brought under control, when the breath does
        not fly around, wandering restlessly. Dwelling in the land of
        the Formless Lord, realizing the Hukam of His Command, His contemplative
        wisdom is attained. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Guru is
        the Form of the Creator, the Primal Lord God; he alone knows,
        who has tried it. So speaks Bhikhaa: I have met the Guru. With
        love and intuitive affection, He has bestowed the Blessed Vision
        of His Darshan.  || 1 || 19 ||   I have been searching for the
        Saints; I have seen so many Holy and spiritual people. The hermits,
        Sannyaasees, ascetics, penitents, fanatics and Pandits all speak
        sweetly. </p>
