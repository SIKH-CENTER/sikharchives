      <p> The followers of the six orders wander and roam around wearing
        religious robes, but they do not meet God. They keep the lunar
        fasts, but they are of no account. Those who read the Vedas in
        their entirety, still do not see the sublime essence of reality.
        They apply ceremonial marks to their foreheads, and take cleansing
        baths, but they are blackened within. They wear religious robes,
        but without the True Teachings, God is not found. One who had
        strayed, finds the Path again, if such pre-ordained destiny is
        written on his forehead. One who sees the Guru with his eyes,
        embellishes and exalts his human life.  || 13 ||   DAKHANAY, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  Focus on that which will not pass away. Abandon your
        false actions, and meditate on the True Master.  || 1 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  God's Light is permeating all, like the moon reflected
        in the water. He Himself is revealed, O Nanak, to one who has
        such destiny inscribed upon his forehead.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        One's face becomes beautiful, chanting the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, and singing His Glorious Praises, twenty-four hours
        a day. O Nanak, in the Court of the Lord, you shall be accepted;
        even the homeless find a home there.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  By wearing
        religious robes outwardly, God, the Inner-knower is not found.
        Without the One Dear Lord, all wander around aimlessly. Their
        minds are imbued with attachment to family, and so they continually
        wander around, puffed up with pride. The arrogant wander around
        the world; why are they so proud of their wealth? Their wealth
        shall not go with them when they depart; in an instant, it is
        gone. They wander around in the world, according to the Hukam
        of the Lord's Command. When one's karma is activated,
        one finds the Guru, and through Him, the Lord and Master is found.
        That humble being, who serves the Lord, has his affairs resolved
        by the Lord.  || 14 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  All speak with
        their mouths, but rare are those one who realize death. Nanak
        is the dust of the feet of those who have faith in the One Lord.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Know that He dwells within all; rare are
        those who realize this. There is no obscuring veil on the body
        of that one, O Nanak, who meets the Guru.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        I drink in the water which has washed the feet of those who share
        the Teachings. My body is filled with infinite love to see my
        True Master.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  Forgetting the Naam, the Name
        of the Fearless Lord, he becomes attached to Maya. He comes and
        goes, and wanders, dancing in countless incarnations. He gives
        his word, but then backs out. All that he says is false. The false
        person is hollow within; he is totally engrossed in falsehood.
        He tries to take vengeance upon the Lord, who bears no vengeance;
        such a person is trapped by falsehood and greed. The True King,
        the Primal Lord God, kills him when He sees what he has done.
        The Messenger of Death sees him, and he rots away in pain. Even-handed
        justice is administered, O Nanak, in the Court of the True Lord.
        || 15 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the early hours of the
        morning, chant the Name of God, and meditate on the Feet of the
        Guru. The filth of birth and death is erased, singing the Glorious
        Praises of the True Lord.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The body is
        dark, blind and empty, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        O Nanak, fruitful is the birth of one, within whose heart the
        True Master dwells.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  With my eyes, I have
        seen the Light; my great thirst for Him is not quenched. <br>

      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, these are not the eyes which can see my Beloved Husband
        Lord.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  That humble being, who, as Gurmukh,
        serves the Lord, obtains all peace and pleasure. He Himself is
        saved, along with his family, and all the world is saved as well.
        He collects the wealth of the Lord's Name, and all his
        thirst is quenched. He renounces worldly greed, and his inner
        being is lovingly attuned to the Lord. Forever and ever, the home
        of his heart is filled with bliss; the Lord is his companion,
        help and support. He looks alike upon enemy and friend, and wishes
        well to all. He alone is fulfilled in this world, who meditates
        on the spiritual wisdom of the Guru. He obtains what is pre-ordained
        for him, according to the Lord.  || 16 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The true person is said to be beautiful; false is the reputation
        of the false. O Nanak, rare are those who have Truth in their
        laps.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The face of my friend, the Lord,
        is incomparably beautiful; I would watch Him, twenty-four hours
        a day. In sleep, I saw my Husband Lord; I am a sacrifice to that
        dream.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  O my friend, realize the True Lord.
        Just to talk about Him is useless. See Him within your mind; your
        Beloved is not far away.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  The earth, the Akaashic
        ethers of the sky, the nether regions of the underworld, the moon
        and the sun shall pass away. Emperors, bankers, rulers and leaders
        shall depart, and their homes shall be demolished. The poor and
        the rich, the humble and the intoxicated, all these people shall
        pass away. The Qazis, Shaykhs and preachers shall all arise and
        depart. The spiritual teachers, prophets and disciples -
        none of these shall remain permanently. Fasts, calls to prayer
        and sacred scriptures - without understanding, all these
        shall vanish. The 8.4 million species of beings of the earth shall
        all continue coming and going in reincarnation. The One True Lord
        God is eternal and unchanging. The Lord's slave is also
        eternal.  || 17 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have seen and examined
        all; without the One Lord, there is none at all. Come, and show
        me Your face, O my friend, so that my body and mind may be cooled
        and soothed.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The lover is without hope,
        but within my mind, there is great hope. In the midst of hope,
        only You, O Lord, remain free of hope; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice to You.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Even if I just hear
        of separation from You, I am in pain; without seeing You, O Lord,
        I die. Without her Beloved, the separated lover takes no comfort.
        || 3 ||   PAUREE:  River-banks, sacred shrines, idols, temples,
        and places of pilgrimage like Kaydarnaat'h, Mat'huraa
        and Benares, the thirty-three million gods, along with Indra,
        shall all pass away. The Simritees, Shaastras, the four Vedas
        and the six systems of philosophy shall vanish. Prayer books,
        Pandits, religious scholars, songs, poems and poets shall also
        depart. Those who are celibate, truthful and charitiable, and
        the Sannyaasee hermits are all subject to death. The silent sages,
        the Yogis and the nudists, along with the Messengers of Death,
        shall pass away. Whatever is seen shall perish; all will dissolve
        and disappear. Only the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord,
        is permanent. His servant becomes permanent as well.  || 18 ||
        DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  Hundreds of times naked does not make
        the person naked; tens of thousands of hungers do not make him
        hungry; millions of pains do not cause him pain. O Nanak, the
        Husband Lord blesses him with his Glance of Grace. <br>

      </p>
      <p> || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Even if one were to enjoy all pleasures,
        and be master of the entire earth, O Nanak, all of that is just
        a disease. Without the Naam, he is dead.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        Yearn for the One Lord, and make Him your friend. O Nanak, He
        alone fulfills your hopes; you should feel embarrassed, visiting
        other places.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  The One and only Lord is eternal,
        imperishable, inaccessible and incomprehensible. The treasure
        of the Naam is eternal and imperishable. Meditating in remembrance
        on Him, the Lord is attained. The Kirtan of His Praises is eternal
        and imperishable; the Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord of the Universe. Truth, righteousness, Dharma and intense
        meditation are eternal and imperishable. Day and night, worship
        the Lord in adoration. Compassion, righteousness, Dharma and intense
        meditation are eternal and imperishable; they alone obtain these,
        who have such pre-ordained destiny. The inscription inscribed
        upon one's forehead is eternal and imperishable; it cannot
        be avoided by avoidance. The Congregation, the Company of the
        Holy, and the word of the humble, are eternal and imperishable.
        The Holy Guru is eternal and imperishable. Those who have such
        pre-ordained destiny worship and adore the Lord, forever and ever.
        || 19 ||   SHALOK,  DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who himself has
        drowned - how can he carry anyone else across? One who
        is imbued with the Love of the Husband Lord - O Nanak,
        he himself is saved, and he saves others as well.  || 1 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  Wherever someone speaks and hears the Name of my Beloved
        Lord, that is where I go, O Nanak, to see Him, and blossom forth
        in bliss.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  You are in love with your children
        and your wife; why do you keep calling them your own? O Nanak,
        without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the human body has no
        foundation.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  With my eyes, I gaze upon the
        Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan; I touch my forehead
        to the Guru's feet. With my feet I walk on the Guru's
        Path; with my hands, I wave the fan over Him. I meditate on Akaal
        Moorat, the undying form, within my heart; day and night, I meditate
        on Him. I have renounced all possessiveness, and have placed my
        faith in the all-powerful Guru. The Guru has blessed me with the
        treasure of the Naam; I am rid of all sufferings. Eat and enjoy
        the Naam, the Name of the indescribable Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.
        Confirm your faith in the Naam, charity and self-purification;
        chant the Guru's sermon forever. Blessed with intuitive
        poise, I have found God; I am rid of the fear of the Messenger
        of Death.  || 20 ||    SHALOK,  DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  I am centered
        and focused on my Beloved, but I am not satisfied, even by seeing
        Him. The Lord and Master is within all; I do not see any other.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The sayings of the Saints are the paths
        of peace. O Nanak, they alone obtain them, upon whose foreheads
        such destiny is written.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  He is totally
        permeating the mountains, oceans, deserts, lands, forests, orchards,
        caves, the nether regions of the underworld, the Akaashic ethers
        of the skies, and all hearts. Nanak sees that they are all strung
        on the same thread.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  The Dear Lord is my mother,
        the Dear Lord is my father; the Dear Lord cherishes and nurtures
        me. The Dear Lord takes care of me; I am the child of the Lord.
        Slowly and steadily, He feeds me; He never fails. He does not
        remind me of my faults; He hugs me close in His embrace. Whatever
        I ask for, He give me; the Lord is my peace-giving father. <br>

      </p>
      <p> He has blessed me with the capital, the wealth of spiritual wisdom;
        He has made me worthy of this merchandise. He has made me a partner
        with the Guru; I have obtained all peace and comforts. He is with
        me, and shall never separate from me; the Lord, my father, is
        potent to do everything.  || 21 ||   SHALOK,  DAKHANAY,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  O Nanak, break away from the false, and seek out the Saints,
        your true friends. The false shall leave you, even while you are
        still alive; but the Saints shall not forsake you, even when you
        are dead.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  O Nanak, the lightning flashes,
        and thunder echoes in the dark black clouds. The downpour from
        the clouds is heavy; O Nanak, the soul-brides are exalted and
        embellished with their Beloved.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The ponds
        and the lands are overflowing with water, and the cold wind is
        blowing. Her bed is adorned with gold, diamonds and rubies; she
        is blessed with beautiful gowns and delicacies, O Nanak, but without
        her Beloved, she burns in agony.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  He does the
        dees which the Creator causes him to do. Even if you run in hundreds
        of directions, O mortal, you shall still receive what you are
        pre-destined to receive. Without good karma, you shall obtain
        nothing, even if you wander across the whole world. Meeting with
        the Guru, you shall know the Fear of God, and other fears shall
        be taken away. Through the Fear of God, the attitude of detachment
        wells up, and one sets out in search of the Lord. Searching and
        searching, intuitive wisdom wells up, and then, one is not born
        to die again. Practicing meditation within my heart, I have found
        the Sanctuary of the Holy. Whoever the Lord places on the boat
        of Guru Nanak, is carried across the terrifying world-ocean. 
        || 22 ||    SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  First, accept death, and give
        up any hope of life. Become the dust of the feet of all, and then,
        you may come to me.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  See, that only one
        who has died, truly lives; one who is alive, consider him dead.
        Those who are in love with the One Lord, are the supreme people.
        || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Pain does not even approach that person,
        within whose mind God abides. Hunger and thirst do not affect
        him, and the Messenger of Death does not approach him.  || 3 ||
        PAUREE:  Your worth cannot be estimated, O True, Unmoving Lord
        God. The Siddhas, seekers, spiritual teachers and meditators -
        who among them can measure You? You are all-powerful, to form
        and break; You create and destroy all.  You are all-powerful to
        act, and inspire all to act; You speak through each and every
        heart. You give sustanance to all; why should mankind waver? You
        are deep, profound and unfathomable; Your virtuous spiritual wisdom
        is priceless. They do the deeds which they are pre-ordained to
        do. Without You, there is nothing at all; Nanak chants Your Glorious
        Praises.  || 23 || 1 || 2 || <br>

      <p> What is the use of reading the Vedas and the Puraanas? It is like
        loading a donkey with sandalwood. You do not know the exalted
        state of the Lord's Name; how will you ever cross over?
        || 1 ||   You kill living beings, and call it a righteous action.
        Tell me, brother, what would you call an unrighteous action? You
        call yourself the most excellent sage; then who would you call
        a butcher?  || 2 ||   You are blind in your mind, and do not understand
        your own self; how can you make others understand, O brother?
        For the sake of Maya and money, you sell knowledge; your life
        is totally worthless.  || 3 ||   Naarad and Vyaasa say these things;
        go and ask Suk Dayv as well. Says Kabeer, chanting the Lord's
        Name, you shall be saved; otherwise, you shall drown, brother.
        || 4 || 1 ||   Living in the forest, how will you find Him? Not
        until you remove corruption from your mind. Those who look alike
        upon home and forest, are the most perfect people in the world.
        || 1 ||   You shall find real peace in the Lord, if you lovingly
        dwell on the Lord within your being.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   What
        is the use of wearing matted hair, smearing the body with ashes,
        and living in a cave? Conquering the mind, one conquers the world,
        and then remains detached from corruption.  || 2 ||   They all
        apply make-up to their eyes; there is little difference between
        their objectives. But those eyes, to which the ointment of spiritual
        wisdom is applied, are approved and supreme.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer,
        now I know my Lord; the Guru has blessed me with spiritual wisdom.
        I have met the Lord, and I am emancipated within; now, my mind
        does not wander at all.  || 4 || 2 ||   You have riches and miraculous
        spiritual powers; so what business do you have with anyone else?
        What should I say about the reality of your talk? I am embarrassed
        even to speak to you.  || 1 ||   One who has found the Lord, does
        not wander from door to door.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The false
        world wanders all around, in hopes of finding wealth to use for
        a few days. That humble being, who drinks in the Lord's
        water, never becomes thirsty again.  || 2 ||   Whoever understands,
        by Guru's Grace, becomes free of hope in the midst of hope.
        One comes to see the Lord everywhere, when the soul becomes detached.
        || 3 ||   I have tasted the sublime essence of the Lord's
        Name; the Lord's Name carries everyone across. Says Kabeer,
        I have become like gold; doubt is dispelled, and I have crossed
        over the world-ocean.  || 4 || 3 ||   Like drops of water in the
        water of the ocean, and like waves in the stream, I merge in the
        Lord. Merging my being into the Absolute Being of God, I have
        become impartial and transparent, like the air.  || 1 ||   Why
        should I come into the world again? Coming and going is by the
        Hukam of His Command; realizing His Hukam, I shall merge in Him.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When the body, formed of the five elements,
        perishes, then any such doubts shall end. Giving up the different
        schools of philosophy, I look upon all equally; I meditate only
        on the One Name.  || 2 ||   Whatever I am attached to, to that
        I am attached; such are the deeds I do. When the Dear Lord grants
        His Grace, then I am merged in the Word of the Guru's Shabad.

      <p> Die while yet alive, and by so dying, be alive; thus you shall
        not be reborn again. Says Kabeer, whoever is absorbed in the Naam
        remains lovingly absorbed in the Primal, Absolute Lord.  || 4
        || 4 ||   If You keep me far away from You, then tell me, what
        is liberation? The One has many forms, and is contained within
        all; how can I be fooled now?  || 1 ||   O Lord, where will You
        take me, to save me? Tell me where, and what sort of liberation
        shall You give me? By Your Grace, I have already obtained it.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   People talk of salvation and being saved,
        as long as they do not understand the essence of reality. I have
        now become pure within my heart, says Kabeer, and my mind is pleased
        and appeased.  || 2 || 5 ||   Raawan made castles and fortresses
        of gold, but he had to abandon them when he left.  || 1 ||   Why
        do you act only to please your mind? When Death comes and grabs
        you by the hair, then only the Name of the Lord will save you.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Death, and deathlessness are the creations
        of our Lord and Master; this show, this expanse, is only an entanglement.
        Says Kabeer, those who have the sublime essence of the Lord in
        their hearts - in the end, they are liberated.  || 2 ||
        6 ||   The body is a village, and the soul is the owner and farmer;
        the five farm-hands live there. The eyes, nose, ears, tongue and
        sensory organs of touch do not obey any order.  || 1 ||   O father,
        now I shall not live in this village. The accountants summoned
        Chitar and Gupat, the recording scribes of the conscious and the
        unconscious, to ask for an account of each and every moment. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls
        for my account, there shall be a very heavy balance against me.
        The five farm-hands shall then run away, and the bailiff shall
        arrest the soul.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: settle
        your accounts in this farm. O Lord, please forgive Your slave
        now, in this life, so that he may not have to return again to
        this terrifying world-ocean.  || 3 || 7 || <br>

        The whole world is filled with hypocrisy.  || 3 ||   Thirst and

        1 ||  Pause  ||   Gazing upon your elephants, you have gone astray
        in doubt; you do not know the Great Lord God. I judge Bidur's

        || 1 ||   I find his rough vegetables to be like rice pudding;
        the night of my life passes singing the Glorious Praises of the

        God, my Husband Lord. I am liberated, and famous throughout the
        four ages; the canopy of praise and fame waves over my head. 
        || 1 ||   Meditating on the Sovereign Lord God, who has not been
        saved? Whoever follows the Guru's Teachings and joins the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is called the most devoted
        of the devotees.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is adorned with the
        conch, the chakra, the mala and the ceremonial tilak mark on his
        forehead; gazing upon his radiant glory, the Messenger of Death
        is scared away. He becomes fearless, and the power of the Lord
        thunders through him; the pains of birth and death are taken away.
        || 2 ||   The Lord blessed Ambreek with fearless dignity, and
        elevated Bhabhikhan to become king. Sudama's Lord and Master
        blessed him with the nine treasures; he made Dhroo permanent and
        unmoving; as the north star, he still hasn't moved.  ||
        3 ||   For the sake of His devotee Prahlaad, God assumed the form
        of the man-lion, and killed Harnaakhash. Says Naam Dayv, the beautiful-haired
        Lord is in the power of His devotees; He is standing at Balraja's
        door, even now!  || 4 || 1 ||   MARU,  KABEER JEE:  You have forgotten
        your religion, O madman; you have forgotten your religion. You
        fill your belly, and sleep like an animal; you have wasted and
        lost this human life.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You never joined the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. You are engrossed in false
        pursuits. You wander like a dog, a pig, a crow; soon, you shall
        have to get up and leave.  || 1 ||   You believe that you yourself
        are great, and that others are small. Those who are false in thought,
        word and deed, I have seen them going to hell.  || 2 ||   The
        lustful, the angry, the clever, the deceitful and the lazy waste
        their lives in slander, and never remember their Lord in meditation.
        || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, the fools, the idiots and the brutes do
        not remember the Lord. They do not know the Lord's Name;
        how can they be carried across?  || 4 || 1 || <br>

        drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.  || 1 ||   Within my mind, I chant

        have to get up and leave.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Clinging to greed,
        you have wasted your life, deluded in the doubt of Maya. Do not
        take pride in your wealth and youth; you shall crumble apart like
        dry paper.  || 1 ||   When the Messenger of Death comes and grabs
        you by the hair, and knocks you down, on that day, you shall be
        powerless. You do not remember the Lord, or vibrate upon Him in

        on your face.  || 2 ||   When the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls
        for your account, what face will you show Him then? Says Kabeer,

        grant Mercy to that person whose touch pollutes the world. You
        exalt and elevate the lowly, O my Lord of the Universe; You are

        The Lord is the ocean of peace; the miraculous tree of life,

        Name, Har, Har, Har? Abandon all other devices of words.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The many epics, the Puraanas and the Vedas are
        all composed out of the letters of the alphabet. After careful
        thought, Vyaasa spoke the supreme truth, that there is nothing
        equal to the Lord's Name.  || 2 ||   In intuitive Samaadhi,
        their troubles are eliminated; the very fortunate ones lovingly
        focus on the Lord. Says Ravi Daas, the Lord's slave remains
        detached from the world; the fear of birth and death runs away
        from his mind.  || 3 || 2 || 15 || </font><br>
