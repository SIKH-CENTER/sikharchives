        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE,  DU-PADAS:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Fire is contained in all firewood, and butter is contained in
        all milk. God's Light is contained in the high and the low;
        the Lord is in the hearts of all beings.  || 1 ||   O Saints,
        He is pervading and permeating each and every heart. The Perfect
        Lord is completely permeating everyone, everywhere; He is diffused
        in the water and the land.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Nanak sings the
        Praises of the Lord, the treasure of excellence; the True Guru
        has dispelled his doubt. The Lord is pervading everywhere, permeating
        all, and yet, He is unattached from all.  || 2 || 1 || 29 || 
        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating on Him, one is in ecstasy;
        the pains of birth and death and fear are removed. The four cardinal
        blessings, and the nine treasures are received; you shall never
        feel hunger or thirst again.  || 1 ||   Chanting His Name, you
        shall be at peace. With each and every breath, meditate on the
        Lord and Master, O my soul, with mind, body and mouth.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   You shall find peace, and your mind shall be soothed
        and cooled; the fire of desire shall not burn within you. The
        Guru has revealed God to Nanak, in the three worlds, in the water,
        the earth and the woods.  || 2 || 2 || 30 ||   SORAT'H, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  Sexual desire, anger, greed, falsehood and slander
        -  please, save me from these, O Lord. Please eradicate these
        from within me, and call me to come close to You.  || 1 ||   You
        alone teach me Your Ways. With the Lord's humble servants,
        I sing His Praises.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   May I never forget the
        Lord within my heart; please, instill such understanding within
        my mind. By great good fortune, servant Nanak has met with the
        Perfect Guru, and now, he will not go anywhere else.  || 2 ||
        3 || 31 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating in remembrance
        on Him, all things are obtained, and one's efforts shall
        not be in vain. Forsaking God, why do you attach yourself to another?
        He is contained in everything.  || 1 ||   O Saints, meditate in
        remembrance on the World-Lord, Har, Har. Joining the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord; your efforts shall be rewarded.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He
        ever preserves and cherishes His servant; with Love, He hugs him
        close. Says Nanak, forgetting You, O God, how can the world find
        life?  || 2 || 4 || 32 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  He is
        imperishable, the Giver of all beings; meditating on Him, all
        filth is removed. He is the treasure of excellence, the object
        of His devotees, but rare are those who find Him.  || 1 ||   O
        my mind, meditate on the Guru, and God, the Cherisher of the world.
        Seeking His Sanctuary, one finds peace, and he shall not suffer
        in pain again.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By great good fortune, one
        obtains the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. </p>

      <p> Meeting them, evil-mindedness is eliminated. Slave Nanak yearns
        for the dust of the feet of those, who have woven the Lord's
        Name into their hearts.  || 2 || 5 || 33 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  He dispels the pains of countless incarnations, and lends
        support to the dry and shrivelled mind. Beholding the Blessed
        Vision of His Darshan, one is enraptured, contemplating the Name
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||   My physician is the Guru, the Lord of
        the Universe. He places the medicine of the Naam into my mouth,
        and cuts away the noose of Death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is
        the all-powerful, Perfect Lord, the Architect of Destiny; He Himself
        is the Doer of deeds. The Lord Himself saves His slave; Nanak
        takes the Support of the Naam.  || 2 || 6 || 34 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Only You know the state of my innermost self; You
        alone can judge me. Please forgive me, O Lord God Master; I have
        committed thousands of sins and mistakes.  || 1 ||   O my Dear
        Lord God Master, You are always near me. O Lord, please bless
        Your disciple with the shelter of Your feet.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Infinite and endless is my Lord and Master; He is lofty,
        virtuous and profoundly deep. Cutting away the noose of death,
        the Lord has made Nanak His slave, and now, what does he owe to
        anyone else?  || 2 || 7 || 35 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, became merciful to me, and
        I obtained all of my mind's desires. I have become stable
        and steady, touching the Lord's Feet, and singing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||   It is a good time,
        a perfectly auspicious time. I am in celestial peace, tranquility
        and ecstasy, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the unstruck
        melody of the sound current vibrates and resounds.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Meeting with my Beloved Lord and Master, my home has become
        a mansion filled with happiness. Servant Nanak has attained the
        treasure of the Lord's Name; all his desires have been fulfilled.
        || 2 || 8 || 36 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Guru's
        feet abide within my heart; God has blessed me with good fortune.
        The Perfect Transcendent Lord became merciful to me, and I found
        the treasure of the Naam within my mind.  || 1 ||   My Guru is
        my Saving Grace, my only best friend. Over and over again, He
        blesses me with double, even four-fold, greatness.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   God saves all beings and creatures, giving them the Blessed
        Vision of His Darshan. Wondrous is the glorious greatness of the
        Perfect Guru; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him.  || 2 || 9
        || 37 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  I gather in and collect
        the immaculate wealth of the Naam; this commodity is inaccessible
        and incomparable. Revel in it, delight in it, be happy and enjoy
        peace, and live long, O Sikhs and brethren.  || 1 ||   I have
        the support of the Lotus Feet of the Lord. By the Grace of the
        Saints, I have found the boat of Truth; embarking on it, I sail
        across the ocean of poison.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The perfect,
        imperishable Lord has become merciful; He Himself has taken care
        of me. Beholding, beholding His Vision, Nanak has blossomed forth
        in ecstasy. O Nanak, He is beyond estimation.  || 2 || 10 || 38
        ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Perfect Guru has revealed
        His power, and compassion has welled up in every heart. Blending
        me with Himself, He has blessed me with glorious greatness, and
        I have found pleasure and happiness.  || 1 ||   The Perfect True
        Guru is always with me. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Meditating on the Supreme Lord God, I am forever in ecstasy. 
        ||  Pause  ||   Inwardly and outwardly, in all places and interspaces,
        wherever I look, He is there. Nanak has found the Guru, by great
        good fortune; no one else is as great as He.  || 2 || 11 || 39
        ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have been blessed with peace,
        pleasure, bliss, and the celestial sound current, gazing upon
        the feet of God. The Savior has saved His child, and the True
        Guru has cured his fever.  || 1 ||   I have been saved, in the
        True Guru's Sanctuary; service to Him does not go in vain.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There is peace within the home of one's
        heart, and there is peace outside as well, when God becomes kind
        and compassionate. O Nanak, no obstacles block my way; my God
        has become gracious and merciful to me.  || 2 || 12 || 40 || 
        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, my mind became excited, and I sang the Praises of
        the jewel of the Naam. My anxiety was dispelled, meditating in
        remembrance on the Infinite Lord; I have crossed over the world
        ocean, O Siblings of Destiny.  || 1 ||   I enshrine the Lord's
        Feet within my heart. I have found peace, and the celestial sound
        current resounds within me; countless diseases have been eradicated.
        ||  Pause  ||   Which of Your Glorious Virtues can I speak and
        describe? Your worth cannot be estimated. O Nanak, the Lord's
        devotees become imperishable and immortal; their God becomes their
        friend and support.  || 2 || 13 || 41 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  My sufferings have come to an end, and all diseases have
        been eradicated. God has showered me with His Grace. Twenty-four
        hours a day, I worship and adore my Lord and Master; my efforts
        have come to fruition.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, You are my peace,
        wealth and capital. Please, save me, O my Beloved! I offer this
        prayer to my God.  ||  Pause  ||   Whatever I ask for, I receive;

        of peace. He is the Doer, the Cause of causes, the Almighty Lord
        and Master, the Perfect Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny.

        His hand, and saved me and made me His own; forever and ever,
        I enjoy His Love.  || 1 ||   The True Lord and Master is forever

        and confirmed His innate nature.  || 1 ||   I have attained the
        Protective Sanctuary of the Lord, my King. In celestial peace

        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Meeting with the council, my doubts were not dispelled. The chiefs
        did not give me satisfaction. I presented my dispute to the noblemen
        as well. But it was only settled by meeting with the King, my
        Lord.  || 1 ||   Now, I do not go searching anywhere else, because
        I have met the Guru, the Lord of the Universe.  ||  Pause  ||
        When I came to God's Darbaar, His Holy Court, then all
        of my cries and complaints were settled. Now that I have attained
        what I had sought, where should I come and where should I go?
        || 2 ||   There, true justice is administered. There, the Lord
        Master and His disciple are one and the same. The Inner-knower,

        || 3 ||   He is the King of all places. There, the unstruck melody
        of the Shabad resounds. Of what use is cleverness when dealing
        with Him? Meeting with Him, O Nanak, one loses his self-conceit.
        || 4 || 1 || 51 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  Enshrine the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your heart; sitting within
        your own home, meditate on the Guru. The Perfect Guru has spoken
        the Truth; the True Peace is obtained only from the Lord.  ||
        1 ||   My Guru has become merciful. In bliss, peace, pleasure

        worth cannot be described. He is the Supreme Overlord of kings.
        Meeting with the Guru, the mind is enraptured.  || 2 ||   All
        sins are washed away, meeting with the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy. The Lord's Name is the treasure of excellence;
        chanting it, one's affairs are perfectly resolved.  || 3
        ||   The Guru has opened the door of liberation, and the entire
        world applauds Him with cheers of victory. O Nanak, God is always
        with me; my fears of birth and death are gone.  || 4 || 2 || 52

        and peace.  || 1 ||   O Saints, salvation comes from the Lord's

        the world, is my Savior. All beings have become kind and compassionate
        to me.  || 1 ||   Meditating on the Guru's feet, I am in
        bliss. There is no fear at all, in God's Sanctuary.  || 
        Pause  ||   You dwell in the hearts of Your slaves, Lord. God
        has laid the eternal foundation. My strength and wealth are Yours,
        Yours. You are my Almighty Lord and Master.  || 2 ||   Whoever
        finds the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is saved by God
        Himself. By His Grace, He has blessed me with the sublime essence
        of the Naam. All joy and pleasure then came to me.  || 3 ||  
        God became my helper and my best friend; everyone rises up and
        bows down at my feet. With each and every breath, meditate on
        God; O Nanak, sing the songs of joy to the Lord.  || 4 || 4 ||
        54 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  Celestial peace and bliss
        have come, meeting God, who is so pleasing to my mind. The Perfect
        Guru showered me with His Mercy, and I attained salvation.  ||
        1 ||   My mind is absorbed in loving devotional worship of the
        Lord, and the unstruck melody of the celestial sound current ever
        resounds within me.  ||  Pause  ||   The Lord's feet are
        my all-powerful shelter and support; my dependence on other people
        is totally finished. I have found the Life of the world, the Great
        Giver; in joyful rapture, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   God has cut away the noose of death. My mind's
        desires have been fulfilled; wherever I look, He is there. Without
        the Lord God, there is no other at all.  || 3 ||   In His Mercy,
        God has protected and preserved me. I am rid of all the pains
        of countless incarnations. I have meditated on the Naam, the Name
        of the Fearless Lord; O Nanak, I have found eternal peace.  ||
        4 || 5 || 55 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Creator has
        brought utter peace to my home; the fever has left my family.
        The Perfect Guru has saved us. I sought the Sanctuary of the True
        Lord.  || 1 ||   The Transcendent Lord Himself has become my Protector.
        Tranquility, intuitive peace and poise welled up in an instant,
        and my mind was comforted forever.  ||  Pause  ||   The Lord,
        Har, Har, gave me the medicine of His Name, which has cured all
        disease. He extended His Mercy to me, and resolved all these affairs.
        || 2 ||   God confirmed His loving nature; He did not take my
        merits or demerits into account. </p>

      <p> The Word of the Guru's Shabad has become manifest, and through
        it, my honor was totally preserved.  || 3 ||   I speak as You
        cause me to speak; O Lord and Master, You are the ocean of excellence.
        Nanak chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, according to the
        Teachings of Truth. God preserves the honor of His slaves.  ||
        4 || 6 || 56 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Creator Lord
        Himself stood between us, and not a hair upon my head was touched.
        The Guru made my cleansing bath successful; meditating on the
        Lord, Har, Har, my sins were erased.  || 1 ||   O Saints, the
        purifying pool of Ram Das is sublime. Whoever bathes in it, his
        family and ancestry are saved, and his soul is saved as well.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The world sings cheers of victory, and the
        fruits of his mind's desires are obtained. Whoever comes
        and bathes here, and meditates on his God, is safe and sound.
        || 2 ||   One who bathes in the healing pool of the Saints, that
        humble being obtains the supreme status. He does not die, or come
        and go in reincarnation; he meditates on the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 3 ||   He alone knows this about God, whom God blesses
        with His kindness. Baba Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God; all
        his worries and anxieties are dispelled.  || 4 || 7 || 57 || 
        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Supreme Lord God has stood by
        me and fulfilled me, and nothing is left unfinished. Attached
        to the Guru's feet, I am saved; I contemplate and cherish
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   He is forever the Savior
        of His slaves. Bestowing His Mercy, He made me His own and preserved
        me; like a mother or father, He cherishes me.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   By great good fortune, I found the True Guru, who obliterated
        the path of the Messenger of Death. My consciousness is focused
        on loving, devotional worship of the Lord. One who lives in this
        meditation is very fortunate indeed.  || 2 ||   He sings the Ambrosial
        Word of the Guru's Bani, and bathes in the dust of the feet
        of the Holy. He Himself bestows His Name. God, the Creator, saves
        us.  || 3 ||   The Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan is
        the support of the breath of life. This is the perfect, pure wisdom.
        The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, has granted His Mercy;
        slave Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master.  || 4
        || 8 || 58 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Perfect Guru has
        attached me to His feet. I have obtained the Lord as my companion,
        my support, my best friend. Wherever I go, I am happy there. By
        His Kind Mercy, God united me with Himself.  || 1 ||   So sing
        forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord with loving devotion.
        You shall obtain all the fruits of your mind's desires, and
        the Lord shall become the companion and the support of your soul.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is the support of the breath of
        life. I am the dust of the feet of the Holy people. I am a sinner,
        but the Lord made me pure. By His Kind Mercy, the Lord blessed
        me with His Praises.  || 2 ||   The Supreme Lord God cherishes
        and nurtures me. He is always with me, the Protector of my soul.
        Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises day and night, I
        shall not be consigned to reincarnation again.  || 3 ||   One
        who is blessed by the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, realizes
        the subtle essence of the Lord. The Messenger of Death does not
        come near him. </p>

        made me perfect. God is totally pervading and permeating everywhere.
        With joy and pleasure, I take my purifying bath. I am a sacrifice
        to the Supreme Lord God.  || 1 ||   I enshrine the lotus feet
        of the Guru within my heart. Not even the tiniest obstacle blocks
        my way; all my affairs are resolved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meeting
        with the Holy Saints, my evil-mindedness was eradicated. All the
        sinners are purified. Bathing in the sacred pool of Guru Ram Das,
        all the sins one has committed are washed away.  || 2 ||   So
        sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe;
        joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on
        Him. The fruits of your mind's desires are obtained by meditating
        on the Perfect Guru within your heart.  || 3 ||   The Guru, the
        Lord of the World, is blissful; chanting, meditating on the Lord
        of supreme bliss, He lives. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. God has confirmed His innate nature.  ||
        4 || 10 || 60 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the ten directions,
        the clouds cover the sky like a canopy; through the dark clouds,
        lightning flashes, and I am terrified. By bed is empty, and my
        eyes are sleepless; my Husband Lord has gone far away.  || 1 ||
        Now, I receive no messages from Him, O mother! When my Beloved
        used to go even a mile away, He would send me four letters.  ||
        Pause  ||   How could I forget this Dear Beloved of mine? He
        is the Giver of peace, and all virtues. Ascending to His Mansion,
        I gaze upon His path, and my eyes are filled with tears.  || 2
        ||   The wall of egotism and pride separates us, but I can hear
        Him nearby. There is a veil between us, like the wings of a butterfly;
        without being able to see Him, He seems so far away.  || 3 ||
        The Lord and Master of all has become merciful; He has dispelled
        all my sufferings. Says Nanak, when the Guru tore down the wall
        of egotism, then, I found my Merciful Lord and Master.  || 4 ||
        All my fears have been dispelled, O mother! Whoever I seek,
        the Guru leads me to find. The Lord, our King, is the treasure
        of all virtue.  ||  Second Pause  || 11 || 61 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Restorer of what was taken away, the Liberator
        from captivity; the Formless Lord, the Destroyer of pain. I do
        not know about karma and good deeds; I do not know about Dharma
        and righteous living. I am so greedy, chasing after Maya. I go
        by the name of God's devotee; please, save this honor of
        Yours.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, You are the honor of the dishonored.
        You make the unworthy ones worthy, O my Lord of the Universe;
        I am a sacrifice to Your almighty creative power.  ||  Pause 
        ||   Like the child, innocently making thousands of mistakes  - 
        his father teaches him, and scolds him so many times, but still,
        he hugs him close in his embrace. Please forgive my past actions,
        God, and place me on Your path for the future.  || 2 ||   The
        Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows all about
        my state of mind; so who else should I go to and speak to? The
        Lord, the Lord of the Universe, is not pleased by mere recitation
        of words; if it is pleasing to His Will, He preserves our honor. </p>

        Himself listens to my prayer. He unites me in Union with the Perfect
        True Guru, and all the cares and anxieties of my mind are dispelled.

        ensues, and one is rid of all suffering and pain. Singing the
        Glorious Praises of God, and meditating on Him, all my affairs
        are brought into harmony.  || 1 ||   Your Name is the Life of
        the world. The Perfect Guru has taught me, that by meditating,
        I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  ||  Pause  ||   You
        are Your own advisor; You hear everything, God, and You do everything.
        You Yourself are the Giver, and You Yourself are the Enjoyer.
        What can this poor creature do?  || 2 ||   Which of Your Glorious
        Virtues should I describe and speak of? Your value cannot be described.
        I live by beholding, beholding You, O God. Your glorious greatness
        is wonderful and amazing!  || 3 ||   Granting His Grace, God my
        Lord and Master Himself saved my honor, and my intellect has been
        made perfect. Forever and ever, Nanak is a sacrifice, longing
        for the dust of the feet of the Saints.  || 4 || 13 || 63 || 
        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  I bow in reverence to the Perfect

        He has become the help and support of His slave. The Creator
        has achieved all my goals, and now, nothing is lacking.  ||  Pause
        ||   The Creator Lord has caused the pool of nectar to be constructed.
        The wealth of Maya follows in my footsteps, and now, nothing is
        lacking at all. This is pleasing to my Perfect True Guru.  ||
        2 ||   Remembering, remembering the Merciful Lord in meditation,

        to the Lord of the world, who created the perfect creation.  ||
