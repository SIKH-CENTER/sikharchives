        <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.</b>
        <p> <b>TRUTH IS THE NAME.</b> </p>

        <p> RAAG BIHAAGRAA,  CHAU-PADAS,  FIFTH MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> To associate with evil demons is to live with snakes; I tried
        all sorts of things.  || 1 ||   Then, I chanted the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, and I found intuitive peace.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Emotional attachment is worthless and false. I claimed for
        myself the possessions of others, sucked into the whirlpool of
        reincarnation.  || 2 ||   All are travellers, who have gathered
        under the tree, held by their many bonds.  || 3 ||   The Company
        of the Holy is stable and permanent; there, the Kirtan of the
        Lord's Praises are sung. Nanak seeks Sanctuary.  || 4 ||

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> RAAG BIHAAGRAA,  NINTH MEHL:</p>
      </center>
      <p> No one knows the state of the Lord. The Yogis, the celibates,
        the austere penitents, and all sorts of clever people have failed.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In an instant, He changes the beggar into
        a king, and the king into a beggar. He fills what is empty, and
        empties what is full. Such are His ways.  || 1 ||   He Himself
        spread out the expanse of His Maya, and He Himself beholds it.
        He assumes so many forms, and plays so many games, and yet He
        remains distinct and detached from it all.  || 2 ||   Incalculable,
        infinite, incomprehensible and immaculate, He has misled the whole
        world. So give up all your doubts; prays Nanak, O mortal, focus
        your consciousness on His Feet.  || 3 || 1 || 2 || </p>

        RAAG BIHAAGRAA,  CHHANT,  FOURTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul; to the
        Gurmukh, the Name of the Lord is priceless. My mind is pierced
        by the sublime essence of the Lord's Name. The Lord is dear
        to my mind. </p>

      </p>
      <p> My mind is washed clean by the sublime essence of the Lord's
        Name. Through the Guru's Teachings, hold the mind steady,
        O my soul; do not let it wander anywhere. One who chants the Bani
        of the Praises of the Lord God, O Nanak, obtains the fruits of
        his mind's desires.  || 1 ||   Through the Guru's Teachings,
        the Nectar abides within the mind, O my soul; with your mouth,
        chants the words of Ambrosia. The Words of the devotees are Ambrosial
        Nectar, O my soul; hear them in the mind, and embrace loving affection
        for the Lord. Separated for so very long, I have found the Lord
        God, intuitively hugged in His Loving Embrace. Servant Nanak's
        mind is filled with bliss, O my soul, vibrating the unstruck Sound-current
        of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   If only my friends and companions would
        come and unite me with my Lord God, O my soul. I dedicate my mind
        to one who recites the sermon of my Lord God, O my soul. As Gurmukh,
        worship the Lord in adoration forever, O my soul, and you shall
        obtain the fruits of your mind's desires. O Nanak, hurry
        to the Lord's Sanctuary, O my soul; those who meditate on
        the Lord's Name are very fortunate.  || 3 ||   By His Grace,
        God comes to meet us, O my soul; through the Guru's Teachings,
        His Name is revealed. Without the Lord, I am so sad, O my soul
        -  as sad as the lotus without water. The Perfect Guru, O
        my soul, has united me with the Lord, my best Friend, the Lord
        God. Blessed, blessed is the Guru, who has shown me the Lord,
        O my soul; servant Nanak blossoms forth in the Name of the Lord.
        || 4 || 1 ||   RAAG BIHAAGRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, is Ambrosial Nectar, O my soul; through the Guru's
        Teachings, this Nectar is obtained. Egotism and Maya are poison,
        O my soul; through the Ambrosial Nectar of the Name, this poison
        is eradicated. The dry mind is rejuvenated, O my soul, meditating
        on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Lord has given the pre-ordained
        blessing of high destiny, O my soul; servant Nanak merges in the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   My mind is attached to
        the Lord, O my soul, like the infant, sucking his mother's
        milk. Without the Lord, I find no peace, O my soul, like the song-bird,
        crying without the rain-drops. Go, and seek the Sanctuary of the
        True Guru, O my soul; He shall tell you of the Glorious Virtues
        of the Lord God. Servant Nanak has merged with the Lord, O my
        soul; the harmonic vibrations of the Shabad resound within the
        heart.  || 2 ||   The self-willed manmukhs are consigned to separation
        by their own egotism, O my soul; bound to poison, they are burnt
        by egotism. Like the pigeon, which itself falls into the trap,
        O my soul, all the self-willed manmukhs fall under the influence
        of death. Those who focus their consciousness on emotional attachment
        to Maya, O my soul  -  those self-willed manmukhs are foolish
        demons. </p>

      <p> The Lord's humble servants beg and implore Him, and seek
        His Sanctuary, O my soul; Guru Nanak becomes their Divine Protector.
        || 3 ||   The Lord's humble servants are saved, through
        the Love of the Lord, O my soul; by their primal good destiny,
        they find the Lord. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the boat,
        O my soul, and the Guru is the Boatman. Through the Word of the
        Shabad, He ferries us across. The Primal Lord God, Har, Har, is
        very kind, O my soul; through the Guru, the True Guru, He seems
        so sweet. Grant Your Grace, and hear my prayer, O Lord, Har, Har;
        servant Nanak meditates on the Naam.  || 4 || 2 ||   BIHAAGRAA,
        FOURTH MEHL:  In this world, the best occupation is to sing the
        Praises of the Naam, O my soul. Singing the Praises of the Lord,
        the Lord is enshrined in the mind. The Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, is immaculate and pure, O my soul. Chanting the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, one is saved. All sins, errors and sorrows are
        cut away, O my soul; the Gurmukh washes off this filth with the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. By great good fortune, servant Nanak
        meditates on the Lord; even fools and idiots like me have been
        saved.  || 1 ||   Those who meditate on the Name of the Lord,
        O my soul, overpower the five passions. The nine treasures of
        the Naam are within, O my soul; the Guru, the True Guru, has revealed
        the Unseen. The Guru has fulfilled my hopes and desires, O my
        soul; meeting the Lord, all hunger is satisfied.  O servant Nanak,
        he alone sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O my soul, upon
        whose forehead the Lord God has inscribed such pre-ordained destiny.
        || 2 ||   I am a deceitful sinner, O my soul; I cheat others,
        and rob and plunder their wealth. But by great good fortune, I
        have found the Guru, O my soul; through the Perfect Guru, I have
        found the way to salvation. The Guru has poured the Ambrosial
        Nectar of the Lord's Name into my mouth, O my soul, and now,
        my dead soul has come back to life. O servant Nanak, those who
        meet the True Guru, O my soul, have all of their pains taken away.
        || 3 ||   The Name of the Lord is the most sublime, O my soul;
        chanting it, one's sins are washed away. The Guru, the Lord,
        has purified even the sinners, O my soul; now, they are famous
        and respected in the four directions, throughout the four ages.
        The filth of egotism is totally wiped away, O my soul, by bathing
        in the Ambrosial Pool of the Lord's Name. Even criminals
        and sinners are saved, O my soul, if they are attuned to the Lord's
        Name, even for an instant, O servant Nanak.  || 4 || 3 ||   BIHAAGRAA,
        FOURTH MEHL:  I am a sacrifice, O my soul, to those who take
        the Support of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Guru, the True
        Guru, implanted the Name within me, O my soul; He has carried
        me across the terrifying world-ocean of poison. Those who have
        single-mindedly meditated on the Lord, O my soul  -  I proclaim
        the victory of those saintly beings. </p>

      <p> Nanak has found peace, meditating on the Lord, O my soul; the
        Lord is the Destroyer of all pain.  || 1 ||   Blessed, blessed
        is that tongue, O my soul, which sings the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord God. Sublime and splendid are those ears, O my soul,
        which listen to the Kirtan of the Your Praises, O Lord. Sublime,
        pure and sacred is that head, O my soul, which falls at the Guru's
        feet. Nanak is a sacrifice to the Guru, O my soul, who has placed
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in my consciousness.  || 2 ||
        Blessed and approved are those eyes, O my soul, which gaze upon
        the Holy True Guru. Sacred and pure are those hands, O my soul,
        which write the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. I worship continually
        the feet of that humble being, O my soul, who walks on the Path
        of Dharma, the path of righteousness. Nanak is a sacrifice to
        those, O my soul, who hear of the Lord, and believe in the Lord's
        Name.  || 3 ||   The earth, the nether regions of the underworld,
        and the Akaashic ethers, O my soul, all meditate on the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har. Wind, water and fire, O my soul, continually
        sing the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. The woods, the meadows
        and the whole creation, O my soul, meditate with their mouths
        on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. O Nanak, one who, as Gurmukh,
        focuses his consciousness on the Lord's devotional worship,
        O my soul, is robed in honor in the Court of the Lord.  || 4 ||
        4 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  Those who do not remember the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul  -  those self-willed
        manmukhs are foolish and ignorant. Those who attach their consciousness
        to emotional attachment and Maya, O my soul, depart regretfully
        in the end. They find no place of rest in the Court of the Lord,
        O my soul; those self-willed manmukhs are lured by sin. O servant
        Nanak, those who meet the Guru are saved, O my soul; chanting
        the Name of the Lord, they are absorbed in the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   Go, everyone, and meet the True Guru, O my soul; He
        implants the Name of the Lord, Har, har, within. Do not hesitate
        for an instant  -  meditate on the Lord, O my soul; who knows
        whether or not you shall draw another breath? That time, that
        moment, that instant, that second is so fruitful, O my soul, when
        the Lord comes into my consciousness. Servant Nanak has meditated
        on the Naam, O my soul, and now, the Messenger of Death does not
        even approach him.  || 2 ||   The Lord continually watches and
        hears everything, O my soul; only those who commit sins are afraid.
        Those whose hearts are pure within, O my soul, cast off all their
        fears. </p>

      <p> Those who have faith in the Name of the Fearless Lord, O my soul
        -  all their enemies and attackers speak against them in vain.
        Nanak serves the Perfect Guru, O my soul, who causes all to fall
        at His feet.  || 3 ||   So serve such a Lord continuously, O my
        soul, who is the Great Lord and Master of all. Those who single-mindedly
        worship Him in adoration, O my soul, are not subservient to anyone.
        Serving the Guru, I have obtained the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, O my soul; all the slanderers and trouble-makers bark
        in vain. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, O my soul; such
        is the pre-ordained destiny which the Lord has written on his
        forehead.  || 4 || 5 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  All beings
        are Yours  -  You permeate them all, O my Lord God; You know
        what they do in their hearts. The Lord is with them, inwardly
        and outwardly, O my soul; He sees everything, but they deny the
        Lord in their minds. The Lord is far away from the self-willed
        manmukhs, O my soul; all their efforts are in vain. Servant Nanak,
        as Gurmukh, meditates, O my soul, and comes to behold the Lord
        ever-present.  || 1 ||   They are devotees, and they are selfless
        servants, O my soul, who are pleasing to the Mind of my God. They
        are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord, O my soul; night
        and day, they remain absorbed in the True One. In their company,
        one's filth is washed away, O my soul; attuned to the Lord's
        Love, one comes to bear the Mark of His Grace. Nanak prays to
        God, O my soul; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        he is satisfied.  || 2 ||   O tongue, chant and meditate on the
        Lord of the Universe; O my soul, chanting the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, your thirst shall be quenched. One unto whom my Supreme
        Lord God shows Mercy, O my soul, enshrines the Name in his mind.
        One who meets the Perfect True Guru, O my soul, obtains the treasure
        of the Lord's wealth. By great good fortune, one joins the
        Sangat, the Holy Congregation, O my soul. O Nanak, sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord.  || 3 ||   In all places and interspaces,
        O my soul, the Supreme Lord God, the Great Giver, is pervading.
        His limits cannot be found, O my soul; He is the Perfect Architect
        of Destiny. He cherishes all beings, O my soul, as the mother
        and father cherish their child. By thousands of clever tricks,
        He cannot be obtained, O my soul; servant Nanak, as Gurmukh, has
        come to know the Lord.  || 4 || 6 ||  First Set of Six  || </p>

        BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  CHHANT,  FIRST HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> I have seen a miracle of the Lord, O my dear beloveds  -  whatever
        He does is righteous and just. The Lord has fashioned this beautiful
        arena, O my dear beloveds, where all come and go. </p>

      </p>
      <p> The One who fashioned the world causes them to come and go. Some
        meet the True Guru  -  the Lord invites them into the Mansion
        of His Presence; others wander around, deluded by doubt. You alone
        know Your limits; You are contained in all. Nanak speaks the Truth
        -  listen, Saints: the Lord dispenses even-handed justice.
        || 1 ||   Come and join with me, O my beautiful dear beloveds;
        let's worship the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Let's
        serve the Perfect True Guru, O my dear beloveds, and clear away
        the Path of Death. Having cleared the treacherous path, as Gurmukhs
        we shall obtain honor in the Court of the Lord. Those who have
        such pre-ordained destiny, lovingly focus their attention on the
        Lord, night and day. Egotism, possessiveness and emotional attachment
        are eradicated when one joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy. Says servant Nanak, one who contemplates the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, is liberated.  || 2 ||   Let's join hands,
        O Saints; let's come together, O my dear beloveds, and worship
        the Imperishable, Almighty Lord God. I sought Him through uncounted
        forms of adoration, O my dear beloveds; now, I dedicate all my
        mind and body to the Lord. Mind, body and wealth all belong to
        God; so what can anyone offer Him in worship? He alone merges
        in the lap of God, unto whom the Merciful Lord and Master becomes
        kind. One who has such pre-ordained destiny written on his forehead,
        comes to bear love for the Guru. Says servant Nanak, join the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and worship the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   I wandered around, searching in
        the ten directions, O my dear beloveds, but I came to find the
        Lord in the home of my own being. The Dear Lord has fashioned
        the body as the temple of the Lord, O my dear beloveds; the Lord
        continues to dwell there. The Lord and Master Himself is pervading
        everywhere; He is revealed to the Gurmukh. Darkness is dispelled,
        and pain is removed, when the sublime essence of the Lord's
        Ambrosial Nectar trickles down. Wherever I look, the Lord and
        Master is there. The Supreme Lord God is everywhere. Says servant
        Nanak, meeting the True Guru, I have found the Lord within the
        home of my own being.  || 4 || 1 ||   RAAG BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        He is so dear to me; He fascinates my mind; the Lord is the ornament
        of my heart, the support of the breath of life. The Glory of the
        Beloved, the Merciful Lord of the Universe, is beautiful; He is
        infinite and unlimited. O Compassionate Lord of the World, Beloved
        Lord of the Universe, please join with Your humble soul-bride.
        My eyes long for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; the night
        passes, but I cannot sleep. I have applied the healing ointment
        of spiritual wisdom to my eyes; the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is my food. These are all my decorations. Prays Nanak, meditate
        on the Saint, that he may unite us with our Husband Lord.  ||
        1 ||   I endure thousands of reprimands, but still, my Lord has
        not met with me. I try to meet with my Lord, but nothing works.
        My consciousness is unsteady, and my wealth is unstable; without
        my Beloved, I cannot be consoled. </p>

        how can I live? I yearn for Him, and desire Him night and day.
        I cannot live without Him, even for an instant. Prays Nanak: O
        Saint, I am Your slave; by Your Grace, I meet my Husband Lord.
        || 2 ||   I share a bed with my Beloved, but I do not behold
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. I have countless demerits  - 
        how can my Husband Lord call me to the Mansion of His Presence?
        The worthless, dishonored and discarded soul-bride prays: &quot;Meet
        with me, God, O treasure of mercy.&quot; The wall of doubt has
        been shattered, and now I sleep in peace, beholding God, the Lord
        of the nine treasures, even for an instant. If only I could come
        into the Mansion of my Beloved Lord's Presence. Joining with
        Him, I sing the songs of joy. Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary
        of the Saints; please, reveal to me the Blessed Vision of Your
        Darshan.  || 3 ||   By the Grace of the Saints, I have found the
        Lord, Har, Har. My desires are fulfilled, and my mind is at peace;
        the fire within has been quenched. Fruitful is that day and beauteous
        is that night, and countless are the joys, celebrations and pleasures.
        The Lord of the Universe, the Beloved Lord of the World, has been
        revealed. With what tongue can I speak of His Glory? Doubt, greed,
        emotional attachment and corruption are subdued; joining with
        my companions, I sing the songs of joy. Prays Nanak, I meditate
        on the Saint, who has led me to union with the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 4 || 2 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Grant Your Grace, O Guru,
        O Perfect Supreme Lord God, that I might chant the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, night and day. I speak the Ambrosial Words of the
        Guru's Bani, praising the Lord. Your Will seems so sweet
        to me, Lord. Show kindness and compassion, O Lord of the Word,
        Lord of the Universe; without You, I have no other at all. Almighty,
        sublime, infinite and perfect Lord  -  my soul, body, wealth
        and mind are Yours. I am foolish, stupid, masterless, fickle,
        powerless, lowly and ignorant. Prays Nanak, I seek Your Sanctuary
        -  please save me from coming and going in reincarnation.
        || 1 ||   In the Sanctuary of the Holy, I have found the Dear
        Lord; I constantly sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Applying
        the dust of the devotees to the mind and body, O Dear Lord, all
        sinners are sanctified. The sinners are sanctified in the company
        of those who have met the Primal Lord of Destiny. Attuned to the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, they are given the gift of the life
        of the soul; their gifts increase day by day. Wealth, the supernatural
        spiritual powers of the Siddhas, and the nine treasures come to
        those who meditate on the Lord, and conquer their own soul. Prays
        Nanak, it is only by great good fortune that the Holy, the Lord's
        companions are found, O friends.  || 2 ||   Those who deal in
        Truth, O Dear Lord, are the perfect bankers. They possess the
        great treasure, O Dear Lord, and they earn the profit of the Lord's
        Praise. Sexual desire, anger and greed do not cling to those who
        are attuned to God. They know the One, and they believe in the
        One; they are intoxicated with the Lord's Love. They fall
        at the Feet of the Saints, and seek their Sanctuary; their minds
        are filled with joy. Prays Nanak, those who have the Naam in their
        laps are the true bankers.  || 3 || </p>

      <p> O Nanak, meditate in remembrance on that Dear Lord, who supports
        all by His Power. The Gurmukhs do not forget the Dear Lord, the
        Primal Creator Lord, from their minds. Pain, disease and fear
        do not cling to those who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. By the
        Grace of the Saints, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean,
        and obtain their pre-ordained destiny. They are congratulated
        and applauded, and their minds are at peace; they meet the Infinite
        Lord God. Prays Nanak, meditating in remembrance on the Lord,
        Har, Har, my desires are fulfilled.  || 4 || 3 || </p>

        BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> O peaceful night, grow longer  -  I have enshrined love for
        my Beloved. O painful sleep, grow shorter, so that I may constantly
        touch His Feet. I long for the dust of His Feet, and always beg
        for His Name; for His Love, I have renounced the world. I am imbued
        with the Love of my Beloved, intuitively intoxicated with it;
        I have forsaken my terrible evil-mindedness. He has taken me by
        the arm; I am drenched in His Love. I have met my Beloved on the
        Path of Truth. Prays Nanak, please shower me with Your Mercy,
        that I may remain attached to Your Feet.  || 1 ||   O my friends
        and companions, let us remain attached to the Feet of God. My
        mind is filled with a great love for my Beloved; I beg for the
        Lord's devotional worship. The Lord's devotional worship
        is obtained by meditating on God. Let us go and meet the humble
        servants of the Lord. Renounce pride, emotional attachment and
        corruption, and dedicate this body, wealth and mind to Him. The
        Lord God is great, perfect, glorious, absolutely perfect; meeting
        the Lord, Har, Har, the wall of doubt is torn down. Prays Nanak,
        hear these teachings, O friends  -  chant the Lord's Name
        constantly, continually, over and over again.  || 2 ||   The Lord's
        bride is a happy wife; she enjoys all pleasures. She does not
        sit around like a widow, because the Lord God lives forever. She
        does not suffer pain  -  she meditates on God. She is blessed,
        and very fortunate. She sleeps in peaceful ease, her sins are
        eradicated, and she wakes to the joy and love of the Naam. She
        remains absorbed in her Beloved  -  the Lord's Name is
        her ornament. The Words of her Beloved are sweet and pleasing
        to her. Prays Nanak, I have obtained my mind's desires; I
        have met my eternal Husband Lord.  || 3 ||   The songs of bliss
        resound, and millions of pleasures are found in that house; the
        mind and body are permeated by God, the Lord of supreme bliss.
        My Husband Lord is infinite and merciful; He is the Supreme Lord,
        the Lord of the Universe, the Saving Grace of sinners. God, the
        Giver of mercy, the Lord, the Destroyer of pride, carries us across
        the terrifying world-ocean of poison. The Lord lovingly embraces
        whoever comes to His Sanctuary  -  this is the way of the Lord
        and Master. Prays Nanak, I have met my Husband Lord, who plays
        with me forever.  || 4 || 1 || 4 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Lord's Feet are the Pools of Ambrosial Nectar; dwell
        there, O my mind. </p>

      <p> Take your cleansing bath in the Ambrosial Pool of the Lord, and
        all your sins shall be wiped away, O my mind. Take your cleansing
        in the Lord of the Universe forever, O friends, and the pain of
        darkness shall be dispelled. Birth and death shall not hold you,
        and the noose of Death shall be cut away. So join the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, and be imbued with the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord; there, your hopes shall be fulfilled. Prays Nanak,
        shower Your Mercy upon me, Lord, that I might dwell at Your Lotus
        Feet.  || 1 ||   There is bliss and ecstasy there always, and
        the unstruck celestial melody resounds there. Meeting together,
        the humble Saints sing God's Praises, and celebrate His Victory.
        Meeting together, the Saints sing the Praises of the Lord and
        Master; they are pleasing to the Lord, and drenched with the sublime
        essence of His love and affection. They earn the profit of the
        Lord, eradicate self-conceit, and meet Him, from whom they were
        separated for so long. Taking them by the arm, He makes them His
        own; God, the One, Inaccessible and Infinite, bestows His kindness.
        Prays Nanak, forever immaculate are those who vibrate and resonate
        with the True Word of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   Listen, O most fortunate
        ones, to the Ambrosial Bani, the Word of the Lord. Only one who
        has such pre-ordained karma, has it enter into the heart. The
        Unspoken Speech is known only by those unto whom God grants His
        Grace. They become immortal, and shall not die again; their troubles,
        disputes and pains are dispelled. They find the Sanctuary of the
        Lord; they do not forsake Him, and do not leave. God's Love
        is pleasing to their minds and bodies. Prays Nanak, sing forever
        the Sacred Ambrosial Bani of the Word.  || 3 ||   My mind and
        body are intoxicated  -  I cannot describe it. From Him I originated,
        and into Him I shall merge once again. I am absorbed into God's
        Light, through and through, like water merging into water. The
        One permeates the water, the land and the sky  -  I do not
        see any other. He is totally permeating the forests, the fields
        and the three worlds. I cannot express His worth. Prays Nanak,
        He Himself knows  -  the One who created this creation.  ||
        4 || 2 || 5 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Saints go around,
        searching for God, the support of their breath of life. They lose
        the strength of their bodies, if they do not merge with their
        Beloved Lord. O God, my Beloved, merge with me  -  bless me
        with Your kindness; be kind, and attach me to the hem of Your
        robe. Bless me with Your Name, that I may chant it, O Lord and
        Master; beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I live.
        He is almighty, perfect, eternal and unchanging, exalted, unapproachable
        and infinite. Prays Nanak, grant Your Grace, O Beloved of my breath
        of life, that I may merge with You.  || 1 ||   I have practiced
        chanting, intensive meditation and fasting to see Your Feet, Lord.
        But still, the burning fire is not quenched, without the Sanctuary
        of the Lord and Master. O God, I seek Your Sanctuary  -  please,
        cut away my bonds and carry me across the world-ocean. I am helpless,
        forlorn and worthless  -  I know nothing at all; please do
        not count up my merits and demerits. The Lord is Merciful to the
        meek, the Sustainer of the world, Beloved, Almighty Cause of causes. </p>

      <p> Nanak, the song-bird, begs for the rain-drop of the Lord's
        Name; meditating on the Feet of the Lord, Har, Har, he lives.
        || 2 ||   Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar from the sacred pool,
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. In the Society of the Saints,
        one meets the Lord; meditating on Him, one's affairs are
        resolved. God accomplishes everything; He is the Destroyer of
        pain. Never forget Him from your mind, even for an instant. He
        is blissful, night and day; He is forever True. All Glories are
        contained in the Lord in the Universe. Incalculable, lofty and
        infinite is the Lord and Master. His dwelling is unapproachable.
        Prays Nanak, my desires are fulfilled; I have met the Lord, the
        Greatest Lover.  || 3 ||   The fruits of many millions of charitable
        feasts come to those who listen to and sing the Lord's Praise.
        Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, all one's generations
        are carried across. Chanting the Name of the Lord, the mortal
        being is beautified; what Praises of His can I chant? I shall
        never forget the Lord; He is as dear as my breath of life. My
        mind constantly yearns for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
        Auspicious is that day, when God, the lofty, inaccessible and
        infinite, hugs me close in His embrace. Prays Nanak, everything
        is fruitful  -  I have met my supremely beloved Lord God. 
        || 4 || 3 || 6 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  CHHANT:  Why are
        you imbued with the love of another? That path is very dangerous.
        You are committing sins  -  no one is your friend. No one shall
        be your friend; you shall regret and repent forever. You have
        not chanted with your tongue the Praises of the Lord of the World;
        when will these days come again? The leaf, once separated from
        the branch, shall not join with it again; all alone, it falls
        on its way to death. Prays Nanak, without the Lord's Name,
        the soul wanders in suffering forever.  || 1 ||   You are practicing
        deception secretly, but the Lord, the Knower, knows all. When
        the Righteous Judge of Dharma reads your account, you shall be
        squeezed like a sesame seed in the oil-press. For the actions
        you committed, you shall suffer in pain, O mortal being; you shall
        be consigned to countless reincarnations. Emotionally attached
        to Maya, the great enticer, you shall lose this jewel of human
        life. Except for the Name of the One Lord, you are clever in everything
        else. Prays Nanak, those who have such pre-ordained destiny are
        attracted to doubt and emotional attachment.  || 2 ||   No one
        advocates for the ungrateful person, who is separated from the
        Lord. The hard-hearted Messengers of Death come and seize him.
        They seize him, and lead him away, to pay for his evil deeds;
        he was imbued with Maya, the great enticer. He was not Gurmukh
        -  he did not chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
        Universe; and now, the hot irons are put to his chest. He is ruined
        by sexual desire, anger and egotism; deprived of spiritual wisdom,
        he comes to regret. Prays Nanak, by his cursed destiny he has
        gone astray; with his tongue, he does not chant the Name of the
        Lord.  || 3 ||   Without You, God, no one is our savior and protector.
        It is Your Nature, Lord, to save the sinners. O Savior of sinners,
        I have entered Your Sanctuary, O Lord and Master, Compassionate
        Ocean of Mercy. Please, save me from the deep, dark pit, O Creator,
        Cherisher of all hearts. I seek Your Sanctuary; please, cut away
        these heavy bonds, and give me the Support of the One Name. </p>

      <p> Prays Nanak, please give me Your Hand and save me, O Lord of the
        Universe, Merciful to the meek.  || 4 ||   That day is judged
        to be fruitful, when I met with the Lord God. Total happiness
        was revealed, and pain was taken far away. Intuitive peace and
        poise, joy and eternal happiness come from constantly singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World. Joining the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I lovingly worship the Lord;
        I shall not wander again in reincarnation. He has hugged me close
        in His Loving Embrace, with intuitive ease, and the seed of my
        primal destiny has sprouted. Prays Nanak, He Himself has met me;
        He shall never leave me again.  || 5 || 4 || 7 ||   BIHAAGRAA,
        FIFTH MEHL,  CHHANT:  Listen to my prayer, O my Lord and Master.
        I am filled with millions of sins, but still, I am Your slave.
        O Destroyer of pain, Bestower of mercy, Fascinating Lord, Destroyer
        of sorrow and strife: I have come to Your Sanctuary; please preserve
        my honor. You are in all, O Immaculate Lord. God hears and beholds
        all; He is with us, the nearest of the near. O Lord and Master,
        hear Nanak's prayer; please save the servants of Your household.
        || 1 ||   You are eternal and all-powerful; I am a mere beggar,
        Lord. I am intoxicated with emotional attachment to Maya  - 
        save me, Lord! Bound down by greed, emotional attachment and corruption,
        I have made all sorts of bad mistakes. The creator is detached,
        and free of entanglement; one obtains the fruits of his own actions.
        Be kind to me, O Purifier of sinners; I am so tired of wandering
        through reincarnation. Prays Nanak, I am the slave of the Lord;
        God is the Support of my soul, and my breath of life.  || 2 ||
        You are great and all-powerful; my understanding is shallow,
        O Lord. You cherish even those who are ungrateful; Your Glance
        of Grace is perfect, Lord. Your wisdom is unfathomable, O Infinite
        Creator. I am lowly  -  I know nothing at all. Rejecting the
        jewel, I have saved the shell; I am a lowly, ignorant beast. I
        have gathered that fickle wealth which will forsake me; I committed
        sins, over and over again. Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Almighty
        Lord and Master; please, preserve my honor.  || 3 ||   I was separated
        from Him, and now, He has united me with Himself. In the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord. Singing the Praises of the Lord of the Universe, forever
        sublime, the blissful Lord is revealed to me. My bed is adorned
        with God; my God has made me His own. Abandoning anxiety, I have
        become carefree, and I shall not suffer in pain any more. Nanak
        lives by gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the Ocean of
        excellence.  || 4 || 5 || 8 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  CHHANT:
        O you of righteous faith, chant the Lord's Name; why do
        you remain silent? with your eyes, you have seen the treacherous
        ways of Maya. Nothing shall go along with you, except the Name
        of the Lord of the Universe. Land and clothes, gold and silver
        -  all of these things are useless. Children, spouse and worldly
        honors, elephants, horses and other corrupting influences shall
        not go with you. <br>
