        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> AASAA,  THIRD HOUSE,  FIRST MEHL:</p>
      </center>
      <p> You may have thousands of armies, thousands of marching bands
        and lances, and thousands of men to rise and salute you. Your
        rule may extend over thousands of miles, and thousands of men
        may rise to honor you. But, if your honor is of no account to
        the Lord, then all of your ostentatious show is useless.  || 1
        ||   Without the Name of the Lord, the world is in turmoil. Even
        though the fool may be taught again and again, he remains the
        blindest of the blind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You may earn thousands,
        collect thousands, and spend thousands of dollars; thousands may
        come, and thousands may go. But, if your honor is of no account
        to the Lord, then where will you go to find a safe haven?  ||
        2 ||   Thousands of Shaastras may be explained to the mortal,
        and thousands of Pandits may read the Puraanas to him; but, if
        his honor is of no account to the Lord, then all of this is unacceptable.
        || 3 ||   Honor comes from the True Name, the Name of the Merciful
        Creator. If it abides in the heart, day and night, O Nanak, then
        the mortal shall swim across, by His Grace.  || 4 || 1 || 31 ||
        AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  The One Name is my lamp; I have put the
        oil of suffering into it. Its flame has dried up this oil, and
        I have escaped my meeting with the Messenger of Death.  || 1 ||
        O people, do not make fun of me. Thousands of wooden logs, piled
        up together, need only a tiny flame to burn.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   The Lord is my festive dish, of rice balls on leafy plates;
        the True Name of the Creator Lord is my funeral ceremony. Here
        and hereafter, in the past and in the future, this is my support.
        || 2 ||   The Lord's Praise is my River Ganges and my city
        of Benares; my soul takes its sacred cleansing bath there. That
        becomes my true cleansing bath, if night and day, I enshrine love
        for You.  || 3 ||   The rice balls are offered to the gods and
        the dead ancestors, but it is the Brahmins who eat them! O Nanak,
        the rice balls of the Lord are a gift which is never exhausted.
        || 4 || 2 || 32 || </p>

        AASAA,  FOURTH HOUSE,  FIRST MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The Gods, yearning for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan,
        suffered through pain and hunger at the sacred shrines. The yogis
        and the celibates live their disciplined lifestyle, while others
        wear saffron robes and become hermits.  || 1 ||   For Your sake,
        O Lord Master, they are imbued with love. Your Names are so many,
        and Your Forms are endless. No one can tell how may Glorious Virtues
        You have.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Leaving behind hearth and home,
        palaces, elephants, horses and native lands, mortals have journeyed
        to foreign lands. The spiritual leaders, prophets, seers and men
        of faith renounced the world, and became acceptable.  || 2 ||
        Renouncing tasty delicacies, comfort, happiness and pleasures,
        some have abandoned their clothes and now wear skins. Those who
        suffer in pain, imbued with Your Name, have become beggars at
        Your Door.  || 3 ||   Some wear skins, and carry begging bowls,
        bearing wooden staffs, and sitting on deer skins. Others raise
        their hair in tufts and wear sacred threads and loin-cloths. You
        are the Lord Master, I am just Your puppet. Prays Nanak, what
        is my social status to be?  || 4 || 1 || 33 || </p>

        AASAA,  FIFTH HOUSE,  FIRST MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The five evil passions dwell hidden within the mind. They do not
        remain still, but move around like wanderers.  || 1 ||   My soul
        does not stay held by the Merciful Lord. It is greedy, deceitful,
        sinful and hypocritical, and totally attached to Maya.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I will decorate my neck with garlands of flowers.
        When I meet my Beloved, then I will put on my decorations.  ||
        2 ||   I have five companions and one Spouse. It is ordained from
        the very beginning, that the soul must ultimately depart.  ||
        3 ||   The five companions will lament together. When the soul
        is trapped, prays Nanak, it is called to account.  || 4 || 1 ||
        34 || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <center>
        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> AASAA,  SIXTH HOUSE,  FIRST MEHL:</p>
      </center>
      <p> If the pearl of the mind is strung like a jewel on the thread
        of the breath, and the soul-bride adorns her body with compassion,
        then the Beloved Lord will enjoy His lovely bride.  || 1 ||  
        O my Love, I am fascinated by Your many glories; Your Glorious
        Virtues are not found in any other.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If the
        bride wears the garland of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, around
        her neck, and if she uses the toothbrush of the Lord; and if she
        fashions and wears the bracelet of the Creator Lord around her
        wrist, then she shall hold her consciousness steady.  || 2 ||
        She should make the Lord, the Slayer of demons, her ring, and
        take the Transcendent Lord as her silken clothes. The soul-bride
        should weave patience into the braids of her hair, and apply the
        lotion of the Lord, the Great Lover.  || 3 ||   If she lights
        the lamp in the mansion of her mind, and makes her body the bed
        of the Lord, then, when the King of spiritual wisdom comes to
        her bed, He shall take her, and enjoy her.  || 4 || 1 || 35 ||
        AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  The created being acts as he is made to
        act; what can be said to him, O Siblings of Destiny? Whatever
        the Lord is to do, He is doing; what cleverness could be used
        to affect Him?  || 1 ||   The Order of Your Will is so sweet,
        O Lord; this is pleasing to You. O Nanak, he alone is honored
        with greatness, who is absorbed in the True Name.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The deeds are done according to pre-ordained destiny; no
        one can turn back this Order. As it is written, so it comes to
        pass; no one can erase it.  || 2 ||   He who talks on and on in
        the Lord's Court is known as a joker. He is not successful
        in the game of chess, and his chessmen do not reach their goal.
        || 3 ||   By himself, no one is literate, learned or wise; no
        one is ignorant or evil. When, as a slave, one praises the Lord,
        only then is he known as a human being.  || 4 || 2 || 36 ||  
        AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  Let the Word of the Guru's Shabad be
        the ear-rings in your mind, and wear the patched coat of tolerance.
        Whatever the Lord does, look upon that as good; thus you shall
        obtain the treasure of Sehj Yoga. </p>

      <p> || 1 ||   O father, the soul which is united in union as a Yogi,
        remains united in the supreme essence throughout the ages. One
        who has obtained the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Immaculate
        Lord  -  his body enjoys the pleasure of spiritual wisdom.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Lord's City, he sits in his
        Yogic posture, and he forsakes his desires and conflicts. The
        sound of the horn ever rings out its beautiful melody, and day
        and night, he is filled with the sound current of the Naad.  ||
        2 ||   My cup is reflective meditation, and spiritual wisdom is
        my walking stick; to dwell in the Lord's Presence is the
        ashes I apply to my body. The Praise of the Lord is my occupation;
        and to live as Gurmukh is my pure religion.  || 3 ||   My arm-rest
        is to see the Lord's Light in all, although their forms and
        colors are so numerous. Says Nanak, listen, O Bharthari Yogi:
        love only the Supreme Lord God.  || 4 || 3 || 37 ||   AASAA, 
        FIRST MEHL:  Make spiritual wisdom your molasses, and meditation
        your scented flowers; let good deeds be the herbs. Let devotional
        faith be the distilling fire, and your love the ceramic cup. Thus
        the sweet nectar of life is distilled.  || 1 ||   O Baba, the
        mind is intoxicated with the Naam, drinking in its Nectar. It
        remains absorbed in the Lord's Love. Night and day, remaining
        attached to the Love of the Lord, the celestial music of the Shabad
        resounds.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Perfect Lord naturally gives
        the cup of Truth, to the one upon whom He casts His Glance of
        Grace. One who trades in this Nectar  -  how could he ever
        love the wine of the world?  || 2 ||   The Teachings of the Guru,
        the Ambrosial Bani  -  drinking them in, one becomes acceptable
        and renowned. Unto the one who loves the Lord's Court, and
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, of what use is liberation or
        paradise?  || 3 ||   Imbued with the Lord's Praises, one
        is forever a Bairaagee, a renunciate, and one's life is not
        lost in the gamble. Says Nanak, listen, O Bharthari Yogi: drink
        in the intoxicating nectar of the Lord.  || 4 || 4 || 38 ||  
        AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  Having attacked Khuraasaan, Baabar terrified
        Hindustan. The Creator Himself does not take the blame, but has
        sent the Mugal as the messenger of death. There was so much slaughter
        that the people screamed. Didn't You feel compassion, Lord?
        || 1 ||   O Creator Lord, You are the Master of all. If some
        powerful man strikes out against another man, then no one feels
        any grief in their mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   But if a powerful
        tiger attacks a flock of sheep and kills them, then its master
        must answer for it. This priceless country has been laid waste
        and defiled by dogs, and no one pays any attention to the dead.
        You Yourself unite, and You Yourself separate; I gaze upon Your
        Glorious Greatness.  || 2 ||   One may give himself a great name,
        and revel in the pleasures of the mind, but in the Eyes of the
        Lord and Master, he is just a worm, for all the corn that he eats.
        Only one who dies to his ego while yet alive, obtains the blessings,
        O Nanak, by chanting the Lord's Name.  || 3 || 5 || 39 || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <center>
        RAAG AASAA,  SECOND HOUSE,  THIRD MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan is obtained by great
        good fortune. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, true
        detachment is obtained. </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>
          <b><a name="p361" id="p361">Page 361</a></b>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> The six systems of philosophy are pervasive, but the Guru's
        system is profound and unequalled.  || 1 ||   The Guru's
        system is the way to liberation. The True Lord Himself comes to
        dwell in the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Through the Guru's
        system, the world is saved, if it is embraced with love and affection.
        How rare is that person who truly loves the Guru's Way. Through
        the Guru's system, everlasting peace is obtained.  || 2 ||
        Through the Guru's system, the Door of Salvation is obtained.
        Serving the True Guru, one's family is saved. There is no
        salvation for those who have no Guru. Beguiled by worthless sins,
        they are struck down.  || 3 ||   Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, the body finds peace and tranquility. The Gurmukh is not
        afflicted by pain. The Messenger of Death does not come near him.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukh is absorbed in the True Lord.  || 4 || 1
        || 40 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:  One who dies in the Word of the
        Shabad, eradicates his self-conceit from within. He serves the
        True Guru, with no iota of self-interest. The Fearless Lord, the
        Great Giver, ever abides in his mind. The True Bani of the Word
        is obtained only by good destiny.  || 1 ||   So gather merits,
        and let your demerits depart from within you. You shall be absorbed
        into the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   One who purchases merits, knows the value of these merits.
        He chants the Ambrosial Nectar of the Word, and the Name of the
        Lord. Through the True Bani of the Word, he becomes pure. Through
        merit, the Name is obtained.  || 2 ||   The invaluable merits
        cannot be acquired. The pure mind is absorbed into the True Word
        of the Shabad. How very fortunate are those who meditate on the
        Naam, and ever enshrine in their minds the Lord, the Giver of
        merit.  || 3 ||   I am a sacrifice to those who gather merits.
        At the Gate of Truth, I sing the Glorious Praises of the True
        One. He Himself spontaneously bestows His gifts. O Nanak, the
        value of the Lord cannot be described.  || 4 || 2 || 41 ||   AASAA,
        THIRD MEHL:  Great is the greatness of the True Guru; He merges
        in His Merger, those who have been separated for so long. He Himself
        merges the merged in His Merger. He Himself knows His own worth.
        || 1 ||   How can anyone appraise the Lord's worth? Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one may merge with the Infinite,
        Unapproachable and Incomprehensible Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Few are the Gurmukhs who know His worth. How rare are those
        who receive the Lord's Grace. Through the Sublime Bani of
        His Word, one becomes sublime. The Gurmukh chants the Word of
        the Shabad.  || 2 ||   Without the Name, the body suffers in pain;
        but when one meets the True Guru, then that pain is removed. Without
        meeting the Guru, the mortal earns only pain. The self-willed
        manmukh receives only more punishment.  || 3 ||   The essence
        of the Lord's Name is so very sweet; he alone drinks it,
        whom the Lord causes to drink it. By Guru's Grace, the essence
        of the Lord is obtained. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, salvation is attained.  || 4 || 3 || 42 ||   AASAA,
        THIRD MEHL:  My God is True, deep and profound. Serving Him,
        the body acquires peace and tranquility. Through the Word of the
        Shabad, His humble servants easily swim across. </p>

      <p> I fall at their feet forever and ever.  || 1 ||   Those being
        whose minds are imbued and drenched with the Lord's Love
        -  their pains of birth and death are taken away. They are
        automatically ushered into the Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   One who has tasted the Shabad, obtains the true flavor.
        The Name of the Lord abides within his mind. The Lord God is Eternal
        and All-pervading. He Himself is near, and He Himself is far away.
        || 2 ||   Everyone talks and speaks through speech; the Lord
        Himself forgives, and unites us with Himself. By merely speaking
        and talking, He is not obtained. By Guru's Grace, He comes
        to abide in the mind.  || 3 ||   The Gurmukh eradicates his self-conceit
        from within. He is imbued with the Lord's Love, having discarded
        worldly attachment. He contemplates the utterly Immaculate Word
        of the Guru's Shabad. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is our Salvation.  || 4 || 4 || 43 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:
        Attached to the love of duality, one only incurs pain. Without
        the Word of the Shabad, one's life is wasted away in vain.
        Serving the True Guru, understanding is obtained, and then, one
        is not attached to the love of duality.  || 1 ||   Those who hold
        fast to their roots, become acceptable. Night and day, they meditate
        within their hearts on the Lord's Name; through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, they know the One Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   One who is attached to the branch, does not receive the
        fruits. For blind actions, blind punishment is received. The blind,
        self-willed manmukh finds no place of rest. He is a maggot in
        manure, and in manure he shall rot away.  || 2 ||   Serving the
        Guru, everlasting peace is obtained. Joining the True Congregation,
        the Sat Sangat, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung. One
        who contemplates the Naam, the Name of the Lord, saves himself,
        and his family as well.  || 3 ||   Through the Word of the Guru's
        Bani, the Naam resounds; O Nanak, through the Word of the Shabad,
        one finds the Mansion of the Lord's Presence within the home
        of the heart. Under Guru's Instruction, bathe in the Pool
        of Truth, in the Water of the Lord; thus the filth of evil-mindedness
        and sin shall all be washed away.  || 4 || 5 || 44 ||   AASAA,
        THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukhs are dying; they are wasting
        away in death. In the love of duality, they murder their own souls.
        Crying out,  &quot;Mine, mine!&quot;, they are ruined. They do
        not remember their souls; they are asleep in superstition.  ||
        1 ||   He alone dies a real death, who dies in the Word of the
        Shabad. The Guru has inspired me to realize, that praise and slander
        are one and the same; in this world, the profit is obtained by
        chanting the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who
        lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are dissolved within the
        womb. Useless is the birth of those who are lured by duality.
        Without the Naam, all are burning in pain. The Perfect True Guru
        has given me this understanding.  || 2 ||   The fickle mind is
        struck down so many times. Having lost this opportunity, no place
        of rest shall be found. Cast into the womb of reincarnation, the
        mortal lives in manure; in such a home, the self-willed manmukh
        takes up residence.  || 3 ||   I am forever a sacrifice to my
        True Guru; the light of the Gurmukh blends with the Divine Light
        of the Lord. Through the Immaculate Bani of the Word, the mortal
        dwells within the home of his own inner self. O Nanak, he conquers
        his ego, and remains forever detached.  || 4 || 6 || 45 ||   AASAA,
        THIRD MEHL:  The Lord's slave sets aside his own social
        status. </p>

      <p> He dedicates his mind and body to the True Guru, and seeks His
        Sanctuary. His greatest greatness is that the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, is in his heart. The Beloved Lord God is his constant
        companion.  || 1 ||   He alone is the Lord's slave, who remains
        dead while yet alive. He looks upon pleasure and pain alike; by
        Guru's Grace, he is saved through the Word of the Shabad.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He does his deeds according to the Lord's
        Primal Command. Without the Shabad, no one is approved. Singing
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, the Naam abides within
        the mind. He Himself gives His gifts, without hesitation.  ||
        2 ||   The self-willed manmukh wanders around the world in doubt.
        Without any capital, he makes false transactions. Without any
        capital, he does not obtain any merchandise. The mistaken manmukh
        wastes away his life.  || 3 ||   One who serves the True Guru
        is the Lord's slave. His social status is exalted, and his
        reputation is exalted. Climbing the Guru's Ladder, he becomes
        the most exalted of all. O Nanak, through the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, greatness is obtained.  || 4 || 7 || 46 ||   AASAA,
        THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh practices falsehood, only
        falsehood. He never attains the Mansion of the Lord Presence.
        Attached to duality, he wanders, deluded by doubt. Entangled in
        worldly attachments, he comes and goes.  || 1 ||   Behold, the
        decorations of the discarded bride! Her consciousness is attached
        to children, spouse, wealth, and Maya, falsehood, emotional attachment,
        hypocrisy and corruption.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   She who is pleasing
        to God is forever a happy soul-bride. She makes the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad her decoration. Her bed is so comfortable;
        she enjoys her Lord, night and day. Meeting her Beloved, the obtains
        eternal peace.  || 2 ||   She is a true, virtuous soul-bride,
        who enshrines love for the True Lord. She keeps her Husband Lord
        always clasped to her heart. She sees Him near at hand, ever-present.
        My God is all-pervading everywhere.  || 3 ||   Social status and
        beauty will not go with you hereafter. As are the deeds done here,
        so does one become. Through the Word of the Shabad, one becomes
        the highest of the high. O Nanak, he is absorbed in the True Lord.
        || 4 || 8 || 47 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:  The Lord's humble
        servant is imbued with devotional love, effortlessly and spontaneously.
        Through awe and fear of the Guru, he is truly absorbed in the
        True One. Without the Perfect Guru, devotional love is not obtained.
        The self-willed manmukhs lose their honor, and cry out in pain.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, chant the Lord's Name, and meditate
        on Him forever. You shall always be in ecstasy, day and night,
        and you shall obtain the fruits of your desires.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Through the Perfect Guru, the Perfect Lord is obtained,
        and the Shabad, the True Name, is enshrined in the mind. One who
        bathes in the Pool of Ambrosial Nectar becomes immaculately pure
        within. He becomes forever sanctified, and is absorbed in the
        True Lord.  || 2 ||   He sees the Lord God ever-present. By Guru's
        Grace, he sees the Lord permeating and pervading everywhere. Wherever
        I go, there I see Him. Without the Guru, there is no other Giver.
        || 3 ||   The Guru is the ocean, the perfect treasure, the most
        precious jewel and priceless ruby. By Guru's Grace, the Great
        Giver blesses us; O Nanak, the Forgiving Lord forgives us.  ||
        4 || 9 || 48 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:  The Guru is the Ocean;
        the True Guru is the Embodiment of Truth. Through perfect good
        destiny, one serves the Guru. </p>

      <p> He alone understands, whom the Lord Himself inspires to understand.
        By Guru's Grace, one serves Him.  || 1 ||   With the jewel
        of spiritual wisdom, total understanding is obtained. By Guru's
        Grace, ignorance is dispelled; one then remains wakeful, night
        and day, and beholds the True Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, attachment and pride are burnt
        away. From the Perfect Guru, true understanding is obtained. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one realizes the Lord's
        Presence within. Then, one's coming and going cease, and
        one becomes stable, absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   The world is tied to birth and death. The unconscious,
        self-willed manmukh is enveloped in the darkness of Maya and emotional
        attachment. He slanders others, and practices utter falsehood.
        He is a maggot in manure, and into manure he is absorbed.  ||
        3 ||   Joining the True Congregation, the Sat Sangat, total understanding
        is obtained. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, devotional
        love for the Lord is implanted. One who surrenders to the Lord's
        Will is peaceful forever. O Nanak, he is absorbed into the True
        Lord.  || 4 || 10 || 49 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL,  PANCH-PADAS:
        One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, finds eternal bliss.
        He is united with the True Guru, the Guru, the Lord God. He does
        not die any more, and he does not come or go. Through the Perfect
        Guru, he merges with the True Lord.  || 1 ||   One who has the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, written in his pre-ordained destiny,
        night and day, meditates forever on the Naam; he obtains the wondrous
        blessing of devotional love from the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Those, whom the Lord God has blended with Himself  - 
        their sublime state cannot be described. The Perfect True Guru
        has given the Glorious Greatness, of the most exalted order, and
        I am absorbed into the Lord's Name.  || 2 ||   Whatever the
        Lord does, He does all by Himself. In an instant, He establishes,
        and disestablishes. By merely speaking, talking, shouting and
        preaching about the Lord, even hundreds of times, the mortal is
        not approved.  || 3 ||   The Guru meets with those, who take virtue
        as their treasure; they listen to the True Word of the Guru's
        Bani, the Shabad. Pain departs, from that place where the Shabad
        abides. By the jewel of spiritual wisdom, one is easily absorbed
        into the True Lord.  || 4 ||   No other wealth is as great as
        the Naam. It is bestowed only by the True Lord. Through the Perfect
        Word of the Shabad, it abides in the mind. O Nanak, imbued with
        the Naam, peace is obtained.  || 5 || 11 || 50 ||   AASAA,  THIRD
        MEHL:  One may dance and play numerous instruments; but this mind
        is blind and deaf, so for whose benefit is this speaking and preaching?
        Deep within is the fire of greed, and the dust-storm of doubt.
        The lamp of knowledge is not burning, and understanding is not
        obtained.  || 1 ||   The Gurmukh has the light of devotional worship
        within his heart. Understanding his own self, he meets God.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Gurmukh's dance is to embrace love
        for the Lord; to the beat of the drum, he sheds his ego from within.
        My God is True; He Himself is the Knower of all. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, recognize the Creator Lord within yourself.
        || 2 ||   The Gurmukh is filled with devotional love for the
        Beloved Lord. He intuitively reflects upon the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. For the Gurmukh, loving devotional worship is the way
        to the True Lord. But the dances and the worship of the hypocrites
        bring only pain. </p>

      <p> || 3 ||   True Devotion is to remain dead while yet alive. By
        Guru's Grace, one crosses over the terrible world-ocean.
        Through the Guru's Teachings, one's devotion is accepted,
        and then, the Dear Lord Himself comes to dwell in the mind.  ||
        4 ||   When the Lord bestows His Mercy, He leads us to meet the
        True Guru. Then, one's devotion becomes steady, and the consciousness
        is centered upon the Lord. Those who are imbued with Devotion
        have truthful reputations. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, peace is obtained.  || 5 || 12 || 51 || </p>

      <p> By the Pleasure of the Lord's Will, one meets the True Guru,

        Lord abides in the mind, and one comes to understand the Lord.
        || 1 ||   My Husband Lord, the Great Giver, is One. There is
        no other at all. By Guru's merciful favor, He abides in the
        mind, and then, a lasting peace ensues.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        In this age, the Lord's Name is fearless; it is obtained
        by meditative reflection upon the Guru. Without the Name, the
        blind, foolish, self-willed manmukh is under Death's power.
        || 2 ||   By the Pleasure of the Lord's Will, the humble
        being performs His service, and understands the True Lord. By
        the Pleasure of the Lord's Will, He is to be praised; surrendering
        to His Will, peace ensues.  || 3 ||   By the Pleasure of the Lord's
        Will, the prize of this human birth is obtained, and the intellect
        is exalted. O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as
        Gurmukh, you shall be emancipated.  || 4 || 39 || 13 || 52 || </p>

      <p> You are the True Creator, my Lord Master. That which is pleasing
        to Your Will, comes to pass. Whatever You give, that is what I
        receive.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All are Yours; all meditate on
        You. He alone, whom You bless with Your Mercy, obtains the jewel
        of the Naam. The Gurmukhs obtain it, and the self-willed manmukhs
        lose it. You Yourself separate the mortals, and You Yourself unite
        them.  || 1 ||   You are the River  -  all are within You.
        Other than You, there is no one at all. All beings and creatures
        are your play-things. The united ones are separated, and the separated
        ones are re-united.  || 2 ||   That humble being, whom You inspire
        to understand, understands; he continually speaks and chants the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord. One who serves the Lord, obtains
        peace. He is easily absorbed in the Lord's Name.  || 3 ||
        You Yourself are the Creator; by Your doing, all things come
        to be. Without You, there is no other at all. You watch over the

      <p> Some form alliances with friends, children and siblings. Some
        form alliances with in-laws and relatives. Some form alliances
        with chiefs and leaders for their own selfish motives. My alliance
        is with the Lord, who is pervading everywhere.  || 1 ||   I have
        formed my alliance with the Lord; the Lord is my only support.
        Other than the Lord, I have no other faction or alliance; I sing
        of the countless and endless Glorious Praises of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Those with whom you form alliances, shall perish.
        Making false alliances, the mortals repent and regret in the end.
        Those who practice falsehood shall not last. I have formed my
        alliance with the Lord; there is no one more powerful than Him.
        || 2 ||   All these alliances are mere extensions of the love
        of Maya. Only fools argue over Maya. They are born, and they die,
        and they lose the game of life in the gamble. My alliance is with
        the Lord, who embellishes all, in this world and the next.  ||
        3 ||   In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the five thieves instigate
        alliances and conflicts. Sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional
        attachment and self-conceit have increased. One who is blessed
        by the Lord's Grace, joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
        My alliance is with the Lord, who has destroyed all these alliances.
        || 4 ||   In the false love of duality, people sit and form alliances.
        They complain about other peoples' faults, while their own
        self-conceit only increases. As they plant, so shall they harvest.
        Servant Nanak has joined the Lord's alliance of Dharma, which
        shall conquer the whole world.  || 5 || 2 || 54 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  Constantly listening to the Ambrosial Gurbani in the heart,
        it becomes pleasing to the mind. Through Gurbani, the Incomprehensible
        Lord is comprehended.  || 1 ||   As Gurmukh, listen to the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, O my sisters. The One Lord is pervading
        and permeating deep within the heart; with your mouth, recite
        the Ambrosial Hymns of the Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My mind
        and body are filled with divine love, and great sadness. By great
        good fortune, I have obtained the True Guru, the Primal Being.
        || 2 ||   In the love of duality, the mortals wander through
        poisonous Maya. The unfortunate ones do not meet the True Guru.
        || 3 ||   The Lord Himself inspires us to drink in the Lord's
        Ambrosial Elixir. Through the Perfect Guru, O Nanak, the Lord
        is obtained.  || 4 || 3 || 55 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Love
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Support of my mind and

        1 ||   So chant the Naam, O my friends and companions. Without
        the Naam, there is nothing else for me. By great good fortune,

        ||   Without the Naam, I cannot live. By great good fortune,
        the Gurmukhs obtain the Naam.  || 2 ||   Those who lack the Naam

        the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Chanting and meditating
        on the Naam, my mind becomes blissful. The True Guru has implanted
        the True Name of the True Lord within me; I sing His Glorious
        Praises, and taste the supreme ecstasy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||

        Praises. By great good fortune, the detached, absolute Lord is
        obtained.  || 2 ||   Those without virtue are stained by Maya's
        filth. Lacking virtue, the egotistical die, and suffer reincarnation.

        the Gurmukh churns this ocean, and discovers this essence.  ||

        the Name of the Lord; the Naam is pleasing to my mind. By great
        good fortune, the Gurmukh obtains the Lord.  || 1 ||   Chant the
        Naam, as Gurmukh, and be exalted. Without the Naam, I have no
        other support; the Naam is woven into all my breaths and morsels
        of food.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Naam illuminates my mind; listening
        to it, my mind is pleased. One who speaks the Naam  -  he alone
        is my friend and companion.  || 2 ||   Without the Naam, the fools
        depart naked. They burn away to death, chasing the poison of Maya,
        like the moth chasing the flame.  || 3 ||   He Himself establishes,
        and, having established, disestablishes. O Nanak, the Lord Himself
        bestows the Naam.  || 4 || 6 || 58 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL: 
        The vine of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, has taken root in
        the Gurmukh. It bears the fruit of the Lord; its taste is so tasty!
        || 1 ||   Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in endless waves
        of joy. Chant and repeat the Naam; through the Guru's Teachings
        praise the Lord, and slay the horrible serpent of the Messenger
        of Death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord has implanted His devotional
        worship in the Guru. When the Guru is pleased, He bestows it upon
        His Sikh, O my siblings of Destiny.  || 2 ||   One who acts in
        ego, knows nothing about the Way. He acts like an elephant, who
        takes a bath, and then throws dust on his head.  || 3 ||   If
        one's destiny is great and exalted, O Nanak, one chants the
        Naam, the Name of the Immaculate, True Lord.  || 4 || 7 || 59
        ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  My mind suffers hunger for the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har. Hearing the Naam, my mind is satisfied,
        O my Siblings of Destiny.  || 1 ||   Chant the Naam, O my friends,
        O GurSikhs. Chant the Naam, and through the Naam, obtain peace;
        through the Guru's Teachings, enshrine the Naam in your heart
        and mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Hearing the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, the mind is in bliss. Reaping the profit of the Naam,
        through the Guru's Teachings, my soul has blossomed forth.  ||
        2 ||   Without the Naam, the mortal is a leper, blinded by emotional
        attachment. All his actions are fruitless; they lead only to painful
        entanglements.  || 3 ||   The very fortunate ones chant the Praises

        please link my mind to You.  || 4 || 9 || 61 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  How long must one search for angle bells and cymbals, and
        how long must one play the guitar? In the brief instant between
        coming and going, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   Such is the devotional love which has been produced
        in my mind. Without the Lord, I cannot live even for an instant,
        like the fish which dies without water.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        How long must one tune the five strings, and assemble the seven
        singers, and how long will they raise their voices in song? In
        the time it takes to select and assemble these musicians, a moment
        elapses, and my mind sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. 
        || 2 ||   How long must one dance and stretch out one's feet,
        and how long must one reach out with one's hands? Stretching
        out one's hands and feet, there is a moment's delay;
        and then, my mind meditates on the Lord.  || 3 ||   How long must
        one satisfy the people, in order to obtain honor? O servant Nanak,
        meditate forever in your heart on the Lord, and then everyone
        will congratulate you.  || 4 || 10 || 62 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:
        Join the Sat Sangat, the Lord's True Congregation; joining
        the Company of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        With the sparkling jewel of spiritual wisdom, the heart is illumined,
        and ignorance is dispelled.  || 1 ||   O humble servant of the
        Lord, let your dancing be meditation on the Lord, Har, Har. If
        only I cold meet such Saints, O my Siblings of Destiny; I would
        wash the feet of such servants.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O my mind; night and day, center
        your consciousness on the Lord. You shall have the fruits of your
        desires, and you shall never feel hunger again.  || 2 ||   The
        Infinite Lord Himself is the Creator; the Lord Himself speaks,
        and causes us to speak. The Saints are good, who are pleasing
        to Your Will; their honor is approved by You.  || 3 ||   Nanak
        is not satisfied by chanting the Lord's Glorious Praises;
        the more he chants them, the more he is at peace. The Lord Himself
        has bestowed the treasure of devotional love; His customers purchase
        virtues, and carry them home.  || 4 || 11 || 63 || <br>
