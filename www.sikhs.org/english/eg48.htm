      <p> One unto whom You are Merciful, has his sufferings depart. O Merciful
        Lord, You bless Your devotees with Your Grace. Suffering, pain,
        terrible disease and Maya do not afflict them. This is the Support
        of the devotees, that they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
        of the Universe. Forever and ever, day and night, they meditate
        on the One and Only Lord. Drinking in the Ambrosial Amrit of the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, His humble servants remain satisfied
        with the Naam.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Millions of obstacles
        stand in the way of one who forgets the Name. O Nanak, night and
        day, he croaks like a raven in a deserted house.  || 1 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  Beauteous is that season, when I am united with my Beloved.
        I do not forget Him for a moment or an instant; O Nanak, I contemplate
        Him constantly.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Even brave and mighty men
        cannot withstand the powerful and overwhelming army which the
        five passions have gathered. The ten organs of sensation attach
        even detached renunciates to sensory pleasures. They seek to conquer
        and overpower them, and so increase their following. The world
        of the three dispositions is under their influence; no one can
        stand against them. So tell me  -  how can the fort of doubt
        and the moat of Maya be overcome? Worshipping the Perfect Guru,
        this awesome force is subdued. I stand before Him, day and night,
        with my palms pressed together.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:
        All sins are washed away, by continually singing the Lord's
        Glories. Millions of afflictions are produced, O Nanak, when the
        Name is forgotten.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  O Nanak, meeting the
        True Guru, one comes to know the Perfect Way. While laughing,
        playing, dressing and eating, he is liberated.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Blessed, blessed is the True Guru, who has demolished the fortress
        of doubt. Waaho! Waaho!  -  Hail! Hail! to the True Guru, who
        has united me with the Lord. The Guru has given me the medicine
        of the inexhaustible treasure of the Naam. He has banished the
        great and terrible disease. I have obtained the great treasure
        of the wealth of the Naam. I have obtained eternal life, recognizing
        my own self. The Glory of the all-powerful Divine Guru cannot
        be described. The Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent
        Lord, infinite, unseen and unknowable.  || 16 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Make the effort, and you shall live; practicing it, you
        shall enjoy peace. Meditating, you shall meet God, O Nanak, and
        your anxiety shall vanish.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Bless me with
        sublime thoughts, O Lord of the Universe, and contemplation in
        the immaculate Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. O Nanak,
        may I never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, for even an
        instant; be merciful to me, Lord God.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Whatever
        happens is according to Your Will, so why should I be afraid?
        Meeting Him, I meditate on the Name  -  I offer my soul to
        Him. When the Infinite Lord comes to mind, one is enraptured.
        Who can touch one who has the Formless Lord on his side? Everything
        is under His control; no one is beyond Him. He, the True Lord,
        dwells in the minds of His devotees. </p>

      <p> Your slaves meditate on You; You are the Savior, the Protector
        Lord. You are the Almighty Overlord of all; You bless us with
        Your Glance of Grace.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Take away
        my sexual desire, anger, pride, greed, emotional attachment and
        evil desires. Protect me, O my God; Nanak is forever a sacrifice
        to You.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  By eating and eating, the mouth
        is worn out; by wearing clothes, the limbs grow weary. O Nanak,
        cursed are the lives of those who are not attuned to the Love
        of the True Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  As is the Hukam of Your
        Command, so do things happen. Wherever You keep me, there I go
        and stand. With the Love of Your Name, I wash away my evil-mindedness.
        By continually meditating on You, O Formless Lord, my doubts and
        fears are dispelled. Those who are attuned to Your Love, shall
        not be trapped in reincarnation. Inwardly and outwardly, they
        behold the One Lord with their eyes. Those who recognize the Lord's
        Command never weep. O Nanak, they are blessed with the gift of
        the Name, woven into the fabric of their minds.  || 18 ||   SHALOK,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Those who do not remember the Lord while they are
        alive, shall mix with the dust when they die. O Nanak, the foolish
        and filthy faithless cynic passes his life engrossed in the world.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  One who remembers the Lord while he is
        alive, shall be imbued with the Lord's Love when he dies.
        The precious gift of his life is redeemed, O Nanak, in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  From the
        beginning, and through the ages, You have been our Protector and
        Preserver. True is Your Name, O Creator Lord, and True is Your
        Creation. You do not lack anything; You are filling each and every
        heart. You are merciful and all-powerful; You Yourself cause us
        to serve You. Those whose minds in which You dwell are forever
        at peace. Having created the creation, You Yourself cherish it.
        You Yourself are everything, O infinite, endless Lord. Nanak seeks
        the Protection and Support of the Perfect Guru.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,
        FIFTH MEHL:  In the beginning, in the middle and in the end,
        the Transcendent Lord has saved me. The True Guru has blessed
        me with the Lord's Name, and I have tasted the Ambrosial
        Nectar. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I chant
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day. I have obtained
        all my objectives, and I shall not wander in reincarnation again.
        Everything is in the Hands of the Creator; He does what is done.
        Nanak begs for the gift of the dust of the feet of the Holy, which
        shall deliver him.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Enshrine Him in your
        mind, the One who created you. Whoever meditates on the Lord and
        Master obtains peace. Fruitful is the birth, and approved is the
        coming of the Gurmukh. One who realizes the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command shall be blessed  -  so has the Lord and Master ordained.
        One who is blessed with the Lord's Mercy does not wander.
        Whatever the Lord and Master gives him, with that he is content.
        O Nanak, one who is blessed with the kindness of the Lord, our
        Friend, realizes the Hukam of His Command. But those whom the
        Lord Himself causes to wander, continue to die, and take reincarnation
        again.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The slanderers are destroyed in an
        instant; they are not spared for even a moment. God will not endure
        the sufferings of His slaves, but catching the slanderers, He
        binds them to the cycle of reincarnation. </p>

      <p> Grabbing them by the hair on their heads, the Lord throws them
        down, and leaves them on the path of Death. They cry out in pain,
        in the darkest of hells. But hugging His slaves close to His Heart,
        O Nanak, the True Lord saves them.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Meditate on the Lord, O fortunate ones; He is pervading
        the waters and the earth. O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, and no misfortune shall strike you.  || 1 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  Millions of misfortunes block the way of one who forgets
        the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, like a crow in a deserted house,
        he cries out, night and day.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Meditating, meditating
        in remembrance of the Great Giver, one's heart's desires
        are fulfilled. The hopes and desires of the mind are realized,
        and sorrows are forgotten. The treasure of the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, is obtained; I have searched for it for so long.
        My light is merged into the Light, and my labors are over. I abide
        in that house of peace, poise and bliss. My comings and goings
        have ended  -  there is no birth or death there. The Master
        and the servant have become one, with no sense of separation.
        By Guru's Grace, Nanak is absorbed in the True Lord.  ||

        <p> CHAU-PADAS OF KABEER JEE,  SECOND HOUSE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> With four feet, two horns and a mute mouth, how could you sing
        the Praises of the Lord? Standing up and sitting down, the stick
        shall still fall on you, so where will you hide your head?  ||
        1 ||   Without the Lord, you are like a stray ox; with your nose
        torn, and your shoulders injured, you shall have only the straw
        of coarse grain to eat.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All day long, you
        shall wander in the forest, and even then, your belly will not
        be full. You did not follow the advice of the humble devotees,
        and so you shall obtain the fruits of your actions.  || 2 || 
        Enduring pleasure and pain, drowned in the great ocean of doubt,
        you shall wander in numerous reincarnations. You have lost the
        jewel of human birth by forgetting God; when will you have such
        an opportunity again?  || 3 ||   You turn on the wheel of reincarnation,
        like an ox at the oil-press; the night of your life passes away
        without salvation. Says Kabeer, without the Name of the Lord,
        you shall pound your head, and regret and repent.  || 4 || 1 ||
        GUJRI,  THIRD HOUSE:  Kabeer's mother sobs, cries and bewails
        -  O Lord, how will my grandchildren live?  || 1 ||   Kabeer
        has given up all his spinning and weaving, and written the Name
        of the Lord on his body.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As long as I pass
        the thread through the bobbin, I forget the Lord, my Beloved.
        || 2 ||   My intellect is lowly  -  I am a weaver by birth,
        but I have earned the profit of the Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||
        Says Kabeer, listen, O my mother  -  the Lord alone is the
        Provider, for me and my children.  || 4 || 2 || </p>

      <p> If You gave me an empire, then what glory would be in it for me?
        If You made me beg for charity, what would it take away from me?
        || 1 ||   Meditate and vibrate upon the Lord, O my mind, and
        you shall obtain the state of Nirvaanaa. You shall not have to
        come and go in reincarnation any longer.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        You created all, and You lead them astray in doubt. They alone
        understand, unto whom You give understanding.  || 2 ||   Meeting
        the True Guru, doubt is dispelled. Who else should I worship?
        I can see no other.  || 3 ||   One stone is lovingly decorated,
        while another stone is walked upon. If one is a god, then the
        other must also be a god. Says Naam Dayv, I serve the Lord.  ||
        4 || 1 ||   GUJRI,  FIRST HOUSE:  He does not have even a trace
        of impurity  -  He is beyond impurity. He is fragrantly scented
        -  He has come to take His Seat in my mind. No one saw Him
        come  -  who can know Him, O Siblings of Destiny?  || 1 ||
        Who can describe Him? Who can understand Him? The all-pervading
        Lord has no ancestors, O Siblings of Destiny.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   As the path of a bird's flight across the sky cannot
        be seen, and the path of a fish through the water cannot be seen;
        || 2 ||   As the mirage leads one to mistake the sky for a pitcher
        filled with water  -  so is God, the Lord and Master of Naam
        Dayv, who fits these three comparisons.  || 3 || 2 || </p>

      <p> The calf has contaminated the milk in the breasts. The bumble
        bee has contaminated the flower, and the fish the water.  || 1
        ||   O mother, where shall I find any offering for the Lord's
        worship? I cannot find any other flowers worthy of the incomparable
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The snakes encircle the sandalwood
        trees. Poison and nectar dwell there together.  || 2 ||   Even
        with incense, lamps, offerings of food and fragrant flowers, how
        are Your slaves to worship You?  || 3 ||   I dedicate and offer
        my body and mind to You. By Guru's Grace, I attain the immaculate
        Lord.  || 4 ||   I cannot worship You, nor offer You flowers.

      <p> You have not cleansed the filth from within yourself, although
        outwardly, you wear the dress of a renunciate. In the heart-lotus

        become a Sannyaasee? </p>

        the Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        You eat in each and every house, fattening your body; you wear
        the patched coat and the ear-rings of the beggar, for the sake
        of wealth. You apply the ashes of cremation to your body, but
        without a Guru, you have not found the essence of reality.  ||
        2 ||   Why bother to chant your spells? Why bother to practice
        austerities? Why bother to churn water? Meditate on the Lord of
        Nirvaanaa, who has created the 8.4 million species of beings.
        || 3 ||   Why bother to carry the water-pot, O saffron-robed
        Yogi? Why bother to visit the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage?

        you trying to thresh?  || 4 || 1 ||   GUJRI:  At the very last
        moment, one who thinks of wealth, and dies in such thoughts, shall
        be reincarnated over and over again, in the form of serpents.
        || 1 ||   O sister, do not forget the Name of the Lord of the
        Universe.  ||  Pause  ||   At the very last moment, he who thinks
        of women, and dies in such thoughts, shall be reincarnated over
        and over again as a prostitute.  || 2 ||   At the very last moment,
        one who thinks of his children, and dies in such thoughts, shall
        be reincarnated over and over again as a pig.  || 3 ||   At the
        very last moment, one who thinks of mansions, and dies in such
        thoughts, shall be reincarnated over and over again as a goblin.
        || 4 ||   At the very last moment, one who thinks of the Lord,
        and dies in such thoughts, says Trilochan, that man shall be liberated;
        the Lord shall abide in his heart.  || 5 || 2 || </p>

      <p> In the very beginning, was the Primal Lord, unrivalled, the Lover
        of Truth and other virtues. He is absolutely wonderful, transcending
        creation; remembering Him, all are emancipated.  || 1 ||   Dwell
        only upon the beauteous Name of the Lord, the embodiment of ambrosial
        nectar and reality. Remembering Him in meditation, the fear of
        birth, old age and death will not trouble you.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   If you desire to escape the fear of the Messenger of Death,
        then praise the Lord joyfully, and do good deeds. In the past,
        present and future, He is always the same; He is the embodiment
        of supreme bliss.  || 2 ||   If you seek the path of good conduct,
        forsake greed, and do not look upon other men's property
        and women. Renounce all evil actions and evil inclinations, and
        hurry to the Sanctuary of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Worship the immaculate
        Lord, in thought, word and deed. What is the good of practicing
        Yoga, giving feasts and charity, and practicing penance?  || 4
        ||   Meditate on the Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the Universe,
        O man; He is the source of all the spiritual powers of the Siddhas.
        Jai Dayv has openly come to Him; He is the salvation of all, in
        the past, present and future.  || 5 || 1 || <br>
