        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> GAUREE,  BAAVAN AKHREE ~ THE 52 LETTERS,  FIFTH MEHL:</p>
      </center>
      <p> SHALOK:  The Divine Guru is my mother, the Divine Guru is my father;
        the Divine Guru is my Transcendent Lord and Master. The Divine
        Guru is my companion, the Destroyer of ignorance; the Divine Guru
        is my relative and brother. The Divine Guru is the Giver, the
        Teacher of the Lord's Name. The Divine Guru is the Mantra
        which never fails. The Divine Guru is the Image of peace, truth
        and wisdom. The Divine Guru is the Philosopher's Stone  - 
        touching it, one is transformed. The Divine Guru is the sacred
        shrine of pilgrimage, and the pool of divine ambrosia; bathing
        in the Guru's wisdom, one experiences the Infinite. The Divine
        Guru is the Creator, and the Destroyer of all sins; the Divine
        Guru is the Purifier of sinners. The Divine Guru existed at the
        primal beginning, throughout the ages, in each and every age.
        The Divine Guru is the Mantra of the Lord's Name; chanting
        it, one is saved. O God, please be merciful to me, that I may
        be with the Divine Guru; I am a foolish sinner, but holding onto
        Him, I am carried across. The Divine Guru is the True Guru, the
        Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord; Nanak bows in humble
        reverence to the Lord, the Divine Guru.  || 1 ||   SHALOK:  He
        Himself acts, and causes others to act; He Himself can do everything.
        O Nanak, the One Lord is pervading everywhere; there has never
        been any other, and there never shall be.  || 1 ||   PAUREE: 
        ONG:   I humbly bow in reverence to the One Universal Creator,
        to the Holy True Guru. In the beginning, in the middle, and in
        the end, He is the Formless Lord. He Himself is in the absolute
        state of primal meditation; He Himself is in the seat of peace.
        He Himself listens to His Own Praises. He Himself created Himself.
        He is His Own Father, He is His Own Mother. He Himself is subtle
        and etheric; He Himself is manifest and obvious. O Nanak, His
        wondrous play cannot be understood.  || 1 ||   O God, Merciful
        to the meek, please be kind to me, that my mind might become the
        dust of the feet of Your Saints.  ||  Pause  ||   SHALOK:  He
        Himself is formless, and also formed; the One Lord is without
        attributes, and also with attributes. Describe the One Lord as
        One, and Only One; O Nanak, He is the One, and the many.  || 1
        ||   PAUREE:  ONG:  The One Universal Creator created the Creation
        through the Word of the Primal Guru. He strung it upon His one
        thread. He created the diverse expanse of the three qualities.
        From formless, He appeared as form. The Creator has created the
        creation of all sorts. The attachment of the mind has led to birth
        and death. He Himself is above both, untouched and unaffected.
        O Nanak, He has no end or limitation.  || 2 ||   SHALOK:  Those
        who gather Truth, and the riches of the Lord's Name, are
        rich and very fortunate. O Nanak, truthfulness and purity are
        obtained from Saints such as these.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  SASSA:
        True, True, True is that Lord. No one is separate from the True
        Primal Lord. They alone enter the Lord's Sanctuary, whom
        the Lord inspires to enter. Meditating, meditating in remembrance,
        they sing and preach the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Doubt and
        skepticism do not affect them at all. They behold the manifest
        glory of the Lord. They are the Holy Saints  -  they reach
        this destination. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to them.  || 3
        ||   SHALOK:  Why are you crying out for riches and wealth? All
        this emotional attachment to Maya is false. </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>
          <b><a name="p251" id="p251">Page 251</a></b>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, all are reduced
        to dust.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  DHADHA:  The dust of the feet of
        the Saints is sacred. Blessed are those whose minds are filled
        with this longing. They do not seek wealth, and they do not desire
        paradise. They are immersed in the deep love of their Beloved,
        and the dust of the feet of the Holy. How can worldly affairs
        affect those who do not abandon the One Lord, and who go nowhere
        else? One whose heart is filled with God's Name, O Nanak,
        is a perfect spiritual being of God.  || 4 ||   SHALOK:  By all
        sorts of religious robes, knowledge, meditation and stubborn-mindedness,
        no one has ever met God. Says Nanak, those upon whom God showers
        His Mercy, are devotees of spiritual wisdom.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:
        NGANGA:  Spiritual wisdom is not obtained by mere words of mouth.
        It is not obtained through the various debates of the Shaastras
        and scriptures. They alone are spiritually wise, whose minds are
        firmly fixed on the Lord. Hearing and telling stories, no one
        attains Yoga. They alone are spiritually wise, who remain firmly
        committed to the Lord's Command. Heat and cold are all the
        same to them. The true people of spiritual wisdom are the Gurmukhs,
        who contemplate the essence of reality; O Nanak, the Lord showers
        His Mercy upon them.  || 5 ||   SHALOK:  Those who have come into
        the world without understanding are like animals and beasts. O
        Nanak, those who become Gurmukh understand; upon their foreheads
        is such pre-ordained destiny.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  They have come
        into this world to meditate on the One Lord. But ever since their
        birth, they have been enticed by the fascination of Maya. Upside-down
        in the chamber of the womb, they performed intense meditation.
        They remembered God in meditation with each and every breath.
        But now, they are entangled in things which they must leave behind.
        They forget the Great Giver from their minds. O Nanak, those upon
        whom the Lord showers His Mercy, do not forget Him, here or hereafter.
        || 6 ||   SHALOK:  By His Command, we come, and by His Command,
        we go; no one is beyond His Command. Coming and going in reincarnation
        is ended, O Nanak, for those whose minds are filled with the Lord.
        || 1 ||   PAUREE:  This soul has lived in many wombs. Enticed
        by sweet attachment, it has been trapped in reincarnation. This
        Maya has subjugated beings through the three qualities. Maya has
        infused attachment to itself in each and every heart. O friend,
        tell me some way, by which I may swim across this treacherous
        ocean of Maya. The Lord showers His Mercy, and leads us to join
        the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. O Nanak, Maya does not
        even come near.  || 7 ||   SHALOK:  God Himself causes one to
        perform good and bad actions. The beast indulges in egotism, selfishness
        and conceit; O Nanak, without the Lord, what can anyone do?  ||
        1 ||   PAUREE:  The One Lord Himself is the Cause of all actions.
        He Himself distributes sins and noble acts. In this age, people
        are attached as the Lord attaches them. They receive that which
        the Lord Himself gives. No one knows His limits. Whatever He does,
        comes to pass. From the One, the entire expanse of the Universe
        emanated. O Nanak, He Himself is our Saving Grace.  || 8 ||  
        SHALOK:  Man remains engrossed in women and playful pleasures;
        the tumult of his passion is like the dye of the safflower, which
        fades away all too soon. </p>

      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, seek God's Sanctuary, and your selfishness and conceit
        shall be taken away.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  O mind: without the Lord,
        whatever you are involved in shall bind you in chains. The faithless
        cynic does those deeds which will never allow him to be emancipated.
        Acting in egotism, selfishness and conceit, the lovers of rituals
        carry the unbearable load. When there is no love for the Naam,
        then these rituals are corrupt. The rope of death binds those
        who are in love with the sweet taste of Maya. Deluded by doubt,
        they do not understand that God is always with them. When their
        accounts are called for, they shall not be released; their wall
        of mud cannot be washed clean. One who is made to understand  - 
        O Nanak, that Gurmukh obtains immaculate understanding.  || 9
        ||   SHALOK:  One whose bonds are cut away joins the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. Those who are imbued with the Love of
        the One Lord, O Nanak, take on the deep and lasting color of His
        Love.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  RARRA:  Dye this heart of yours in the
        color of the Lord's Love. Meditate on the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har  -  chant it with your tongue. In the Court of the
        Lord, no one shall speak harshly to you. Everyone shall welcome
        you, saying, &quot;Come, and sit down.&quot; In that Mansion of
        the Lord's Presence, you shall find a home. There is no birth
        or death, or destruction there. One who has such karma written
        on his forehead, O Nanak, has the wealth of the Lord in his home.
        || 10 ||   SHALOK:  Greed, falsehood, corruption and emotional
        attachment entangle the blind and the foolish. Bound down by Maya,
        O Nanak, a foul odor clings to them.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  LALLA:
        People are entangled in the love of corrupt pleasures; they are
        drunk with the wine of egotistical intellect and Maya. In this
        Maya, they are born and die. People act according to the Hukam
        of the Lord's Command. No one is perfect, and no one is imperfect.
        No one is wise, and no one is foolish. Wherever the Lord engages
        someone, there he is engaged. O Nanak, our Lord and Master is
        forever detached.  || 11 ||   SHALOK:  My Beloved God, the Sustainer
        of the World, the Lord of the Universe, is deep, profound and
        unfathomable. There is no other like Him; O Nanak, He is not worried.
        || 1 ||   PAUREE:  LALLA:  There is no one equal to Him. He Himself
        is the One; there shall never be any other. He is now, He has
        been, and He shall always be. No one has ever found His limit.
        In the ant and in the elephant, He is totally pervading. The Lord,
        the Primal Being, is known by everyone everywhere. That one, unto
        whom the Lord has given His Love  -  O Nanak, that Gurmukh
        chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 12 ||   SHALOK:  One
        who knows the taste of the Lord's sublime essence, intuitively
        enjoys the Lord's Love. O Nanak, blessed, blessed, blessed
        are the Lord's humble servants; how fortunate is their coming
        into the world!  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  How fruitful is the coming
        into the world, of those whose tongues celebrate the Praises of
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. They come and dwell with the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy; night and day, they lovingly
        meditate on the Naam. Blessed is the birth of those humble beings
        who are attuned to the Naam; the Lord, the Architect of Destiny,
        bestows His Kind Mercy upon them. They are born only once  - 
        they shall not be reincarnated again. O Nanak, they are absorbed
        into the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.  || 13 ||
        SHALOK:  Chanting it, the mind is filled with bliss; love of
        duality is eliminated, and pain, distress and desires are quenched. </p>

      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, immerse yourself in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. 
        || 1 ||   PAUREE:  YAYYA:  Burn away duality and evil-mindedness.
        Give them up, and sleep in intuitive peace and poise.  Yaya: 
        Go, and seek the Sanctuary of the Saints; with their help, you
        shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  Yaya:  One who weaves
        the One Name into his heart, does not have to take birth again.
        Yaya:  This human life shall not be wasted, if you take the Support
        of the Perfect Guru. O Nanak, one whose heart is filled with the
        One Lord finds peace.  || 14 ||   SHALOK:  The One who dwells
        deep within the mind and body is your friend here and hereafter.
        The Perfect Guru has taught me, O Nanak, to chant His Name continually.
        || 1 ||   PAUREE:  Night and day, meditate in remembrance on
        the One who will be your Help and Support in the end. This poison
        shall last for only a few days; everyone must depart, and leave
        it behind. Who is our mother, father, son and daughter? Household,
        wife, and other things shall not go along with you. So gather
        that wealth which shall never perish, so that you may go to your
        true home with honor. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, those who
        sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy  -  O Nanak, they do not have to endure
        reincarnation again.  || 15 ||   SHALOK:  He may be very handsome,
        born into a highly respected family, very wise, a famous spiritual
        teacher, prosperous and wealthy; but even so, he is looked upon
        as a corpse, O Nanak, if he does not love the Lord God.  || 1
        ||   PAUREE:  NGANGA:  He may be a scholar of the six Shaastras.
        He may practice inhaling, exhaling and holding the breath. He
        may practice spiritual wisdom, meditation, pilgrimages to sacred
        shrines and ritual cleansing baths. He may cook his own food,
        and never touch anyone else's; he may live in the wilderness
        like a hermit. But if he does not enshrine love for the Lord's
        Name within his heart, then everything he does is transitory.
        Even an untouchable pariah is superior to him, O Nanak, if the
        Lord of the World abides in his mind.  || 16 ||   SHALOK:  He
        wanders around in the four quarters and in the ten directions,
        according to the dictates of his karma. Pleasure and pain, liberation
        and reincarnation, O Nanak, come according to one's pre-ordained
        destiny.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  KAKKA:  He is the Creator, the Cause
        of causes. No one can erase His pre-ordained plan. Nothing can
        be done a second time. The Creator Lord does not make mistakes.
        To some, He Himself shows the Way. While He causes others to wander
        miserably in the wilderness. He Himself has set His own play in
        motion. Whatever He gives, O Nanak, that is what we receive. 
        || 17 ||   SHALOK:  People continue to eat and consume and enjoy,
        but the Lord's warehouses are never exhausted. So many chant
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; O Nanak, they cannot be counted.
        || 1 ||   PAUREE:  KHAKHA:  The All-powerful Lord lacks nothing;
        whatever He is to give, He continues to give  -  let anyone
        go anywhere he pleases. The wealth of the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is a treasure to spend; it is the capital of His devotees.
        With tolerance, humility, bliss and intuitive poise, they continue
        to meditate on the Lord, the Treasure of excellence. Those, unto
        whom the Lord shows His Mercy, play happily and blossom forth.
        Those who have the wealth of the Lord's Name in their homes
        are forever wealthy and beautiful. Those who are blessed with
        the Lord's Glance of Grace suffer neither torture, nor pain,
        nor punishment. </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, those who are pleasing to God become perfectly successful.
        || 18 ||   SHALOK:  See, that even by calculating and scheming
        in their minds, people must surely depart in the end. Hopes and
        desires for transitory things are erased for the Gurmukh; O Nanak,
        the Name alone brings true health.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  GAGGA:
        Chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe with each
        and every breath; meditate on Him forever. How can you rely on
        the body? Do not delay, my friend; there is nothing to stand in
        Death's way  -  neither in childhood, nor in youth, nor
        in old age. That time is not known, when the noose of Death shall
        come and fall on you. See, that even spiritual scholars, those
        who meditate, and those who are clever shall not stay in this
        place. Only the fool clings to that, which everyone else has abandoned
        and left behind. By Guru's Grace, one who has such good destiny
        written on his forehead remembers the Lord in meditation. O Nanak,
        blessed and fruitful is the coming of those who obtain the Beloved
        Lord as their Husband.  || 19 ||   SHALOK:  I have searched all
        the Shaastras and the Vedas, and they say nothing except this:
  &quot;In the beginning, throughout the ages, now and forevermore,
        O Nanak, the One Lord alone exists.&quot;  || 1 ||   PAUREE: 
        GHAGHA:  Put this into your mind, that there is no one except
        the Lord. There never was, and there never shall be. He is pervading
        everywhere. You shall be absorbed into Him, O mind, if you come
        to His Sanctuary. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, only the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, shall be of any real use to you. So many
        work and slave continually, but they come to regret and repent
        in the end. Without devotional worship of the Lord, how can they
        find stability? They alone taste the supreme essence, and drink
        in the Ambrosial Nectar, O Nanak, unto whom the Lord, the Guru,
        gives it.  || 20 ||   SHALOK:  He has counted all the days and
        the breaths, and placed them in people's destiny; they do
        not increase or decrease one little bit. Those who long to live
        in doubt and emotional attachment, O Nanak, are total fools. 
        || 1 ||   PAUREE:  NGANGA:  Death seizes those whom God has made
        into faithless cynics. They are born and they die, enduring countless
        incarnations; they do not realize the Lord, the Supreme Soul.
        They alone find spiritual wisdom and meditation, whom the Lord
        blesses with His Mercy; no one is emancipated by counting and
        calculating. The vessel of clay shall surely break. They alone
        live, who, while alive, meditate on the Lord. They are respected,
        O Nanak, and do not remain hidden.  || 21 ||   SHALOK:  Focus
        your consciousness on His Lotus Feet, and the inverted lotus of
        your heart shall blossom forth. The Lord of the Universe Himself
        becomes manifest, O Nanak, through the Teachings of the Saints.
        || 1 ||   PAUREE:  CHACHA:  Blessed, blessed is that day, when
        I became attached to the Lord's Lotus Feet. After wandering
        around in the four quarters and the ten directions, God showed
        His Mercy to me, and then I obtained the Blessed Vision of His
        Darshan. By pure lifestyle and meditation, all duality is removed.
        In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the mind becomes
        immaculate. Anxieties are forgotten, and the One Lord alone is
        seen, O Nanak, by those whose eyes are anointed with the ointment
        of spiritual wisdom.  || 22 ||   SHALOK:  The heart is cooled
        and soothed, and the mind is at peace, chanting and singing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Show such Mercy,
        O God, that Nanak may become the slave of Your slaves.  || 1 ||
        PAUREE:  CHHACHHA:  I am Your child-slave. I am the water-carrier
        of the slave of Your slaves.  Chhachha: </p>

      <p> I long to become the dust under the feet of Your Saints. Please
        shower me with Your Mercy, O Lord God! I have given up my excessive
        cleverness and scheming, and I have taken the support of the Saints
        as my mind's support. Even a puppet of ashes attains the
        supreme status, O Nanak, if it has the help and support of the
        Saints.  || 23 ||   SHALOK:  Practicing oppression and tyranny,
        he puffs himself up; he acts in corruption with his frail, perishable
        body. He is bound by his egotistical intellect; O Nanak, salvation
        comes only through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  
        PAUREE:  JAJJA:  When someone, in his ego, believes that he has
        become something, he is caught in his error, like a parrot in
        a trap. When he believes, in his ego, that he is a devotee and
        a spiritual teacher, then, in the world hereafter, the Lord of
        the Universe shall have no regard for him at all. When he believes
        himself to be a preacher, he is merely a peddler wandering over
        the earth. But one who conquers his ego in the Company of the
        Holy, O Nanak, meets the Lord.  || 24 ||   SHALOK:  Rise early
        in the morning, and chant the Naam; worship and adore the Lord,
        night and day. Anxiety shall not afflict you, O Nanak, and your
        misfortune shall vanish.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  JHAJHA:  Your sorrows
        shall depart, when you deal with the Lord's Name. The faithless
        cynic dies in sorrow and pain; his heart is filled with the love
        of duality. Your evil deeds and sins shall fall away, O my mind,
        listening to the ambrosial speech in the Society of the Saints.
        Sexual desire, anger and wickedness fall away, O Nanak, from those
        who are blessed by the Mercy of the Lord of the World.  || 25
        ||   SHALOK:  You can try all sorts of things, but you still cannot
        remain here, my friend. But you shall live forevermore, O Nanak,
        if you vibrate and love the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 1 ||   PAUREE:  NYANYA:  Know this as absolutely correct,
        that that this ordinary love shall come to an end. You may count
        and calculate as much as you want, but you cannot count how many
        have arisen and departed. Whoever I see shall perish. With whom
        should I associate? Know this as true in your consciousness, that
        the love of Maya is false. He alone knows, and he alone is a Saint,
        who is free of doubt. He is lifted up and out of the deep dark
        pit; the Lord is totally pleased with him. God's Hand is
        All-powerful; He is the Creator, the Cause of causes. O Nanak,
        praise the One, who joins us to Himself.  || 26 ||   SHALOK: 
        The bondage of birth and death is broken and peace is obtained,
        by serving the Holy. O Nanak, may I never forget from my mind,
        the Treasure of Virtue, the Sovereign Lord of the Universe.  ||
        1 ||   PAUREE:  Work for the One Lord; no one returns empty-handed
        from Him. When the Lord abides within your mind, body, mouth and
        heart, then whatever you desire shall come to pass. He alone obtains
        the Lord's service, and the Mansion of His Presence, unto
        whom the Holy Saint is compassionate. He joins the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, only when the Lord Himself shows His
        Mercy. I have searched and searched, across so many worlds, but
        without the Name, there is no peace. The Messenger of Death retreats
        from those who dwell in the Saadh Sangat. Again and again, I am
        forever devoted to the Saints. O Nanak, my sins from so long ago
        have been erased.  || 27 ||   SHALOK:  Those beings, with whom
        the Lord is thoroughly pleased, meet with no obstacles at His
        Door. </p>

      <p> Those humble beings whom God has made His own, O Nanak, are blessed,
        so very blessed.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  T'HAT'HA:  Those
        who have abandoned all else, and who cling to the One Lord alone,
        do not make trouble for anyone's mind. Those who are totally
        absorbed and preoccupied with Maya are dead; they do not find
        happiness anywhere. One who dwells in the Society of the Saints
        finds a great peace; the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam becomes
        sweet to his soul. That humble being, who is pleasing to his Lord
        and Master  -  O Nanak, his mind is cooled and soothed.  ||
        28 ||   SHALOK:  I bow down, and fall to the ground in humble
        adoration, countless times, to the All-powerful Lord, who possesses
        all powers. Please protect me, and save me from wandering, God.
        Reach out and give Nanak Your Hand.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  DADDA:
        This is not your true place; you must know where that place really
        is. You shall come to realize the way to that place, through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad. This place, here, is established
        by hard work, but not one iota of this shall go there with you.
        The value of that place beyond is known only to those, upon whom
        the Perfect Lord God casts His Glance of Grace. That permanent
        and true place is obtained in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy; O Nanak, those humble beings do not waver or wander.
        || 29 ||   SHALOK:  When the Righteous Judge of Dharma begins
        to destroy someone, no one can place any obstacle in His Way.
        O Nanak, those who join the Saadh Sangat and meditate on the Lord
        are saved.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  DHADHA:  Where are you going, wandering
        and searching? Search instead within your own mind. God is with
        you, so why do you wander around from forest to forest? In the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, tear down the mound of
        your frightful, egotistical pride. You shall find peace, and abide
        in intuitive bliss; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of God's
        Darshan, you shall be delighted. One who has such a mound as this,
        dies and suffers the pain of reincarnation through the womb. One
        who is intoxicated by emotional attachment, entangled in egotism,
        selfishness and conceit, shall continue coming and going in reincarnation.
        Slowly and steadily, I have now surrendered to the Holy Saints;
        I have come to their Sanctuary. God has cut away the noose of
        my pain; O Nanak, He has merged me into Himself.  || 30 ||   SHALOK:
        Where the Holy people constantly vibrate the Kirtan of the Praises
        of the Lord of the Universe, O Nanak  -  the Righteous Judge
        says, &quot;Do not approach that place, O Messenger of Death,
        or else neither you nor I shall escape!&quot;  || 1 ||   PAUREE:
        NANNA:  One who conquers his own soul, wins the battle of life.
        One who dies, while fighting against egotism and alienation, becomes
        sublime and beautiful. One who eradicates his ego, remains dead
        while yet alive, through the Teachings of the Perfect Guru. He
        conquers his mind, and meets the Lord; he is dressed in robes
        of honor. He does not claim anything as his own; the One Lord
        is his Anchor and Support. Night and day, he continually contemplates
        the Almighty, Infinite Lord God. He makes his mind the dust of
        all; such is the karma of the deeds he does. Understanding the
        Hukam of the Lord's Command, he attains everlasting peace.
        O Nanak, such is his pre-ordained destiny.  || 31 ||   SHALOK:
        I offer my body, mind and wealth to anyone who can unite me with
        God. O Nanak, my doubts and fears have been dispelled, and the
        Messenger of Death does not see me any longer.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:
        TATTA:  Embrace love for the Treasure of Excellence, the Sovereign
        Lord of the Universe. You shall obtain the fruits of your mind's
        desires, and your burning thirst shall be quenched. </p>

      </p>
      <p> One whose heart is filled with the Name shall have no fear on
        the path of death. He shall obtain salvation, and his intellect
        shall be enlightened; he will find his place in the Mansion of
        the Lord's Presence. Neither wealth, nor household, nor youth,
        nor power shall go along with you. In the Society of the Saints,
        meditate in remembrance on the Lord. This alone shall be of use
        to you. There will be no burning at all, when He Himself takes
        away your fever. O Nanak, the Lord Himself cherishes us; He is
        our Mother and Father.  || 32 ||   SHALOK:  They have grown weary,
        struggling in all sorts of ways; but they are not satisfied, and
        their thirst is not quenched. Gathering in and hoarding what they
        can, the faithless cynics die, O Nanak, but the wealth of Maya
        does not go with them in the end.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  T'HAT'HA:
        Nothing is permanent  -  why do you stretch out your feet?
        You commit so many fraudulent and deceitful actions as you chase
        after Maya. You work to fill up your bag, you fool, and then you
        fall down exhausted. But this shall be of no use to you at all
        at that very last instant. You shall find stability only by vibrating
        upon the Lord of the Universe, and accepting the Teachings of
        the Saints. Embrace love for the One Lord forever  -  this
        is true love! He is the Doer, the Cause of causes. All ways and
        means are in His Hands alone. Whatever You attach me to, to that
        I am attached; O Nanak, I am just a helpless creature.  || 33
        ||   SHALOK:  His slaves have gazed upon the One Lord, the Giver
        of everything. They continue to contemplate Him with each and
        every breath; O Nanak, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is their
        Support.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  DADDA:  The One Lord is the Great
        Giver; He is the Giver to all. There is no limit to His Giving.
        His countless warehouses are filled to overflowing. The Great
        Giver is alive forever. O foolish mind, why have you forgotten
        Him? No one is at fault, my friend. God created the bondage of
        emotional attachment to Maya. He Himself removes the pains of
        the Gurmukh; O Nanak, he is fulfilled.  || 34 ||   SHALOK:  O
        my soul, grasp the Support of the One Lord; give up your hopes
        in others. O Nanak, meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        your affairs shall be resolved.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  DHADHA:  The
        mind's wanderings cease, when one comes to dwell in the Society
        of the Saints. If the Lord is Merciful from the very beginning,
        then one's mind is enlightened. Those who have the true wealth
        are the true bankers. The Lord, Har, Har, is their wealth, and
        they trade in His Name. Patience, glory and honor come to those
        who listen to the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. That Gurmukh whose
        heart remains merged with the Lord, O Nanak, obtains glorious
        greatness.  || 35 ||   SHALOK:  O Nanak, one who chants the Naam,
        and meditates on the Naam with love inwardly and outwardly, receives
        the Teachings from the Perfect Guru; he joins the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, and does not fall into hell.  || 1 ||
        PAUREE:  NANNA:  Those whose minds and bodies are filled with
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, shall not fall into hell. Those
        Gurmukhs who chant the treasure of the Naam, are not destroyed
        by the poison of Maya. Those who have been given the Mantra of
        the Naam by the Guru, shall not be turned away. </p>

      <p> They are filled and fulfilled with the Ambrosial Nectar of the
        Lord, the Treasure of sublime wealth; O Nanak, the unstruck celestial
        melody vibrates for them.  || 36 ||   SHALOK:  The Guru, the Supreme
        Lord God, preserved my honor, when I renounced hypocrisy, emotional
        attachment and corruption. O Nanak, worship and adore the One,
        who has no end or limitation.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  PAPPA:  He is
        beyond estimation; His limits cannot be found. The Sovereign Lord
        King is inaccessible; He is the Purifier of sinners. Millions
        of sinners are purified; they meet the Holy, and chant the Ambrosial
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. Deception, fraud and emotional attachment
        are eliminated, by those who are protected by the Lord of the
        World. He is the Supreme King, with the royal canopy above His
        Head. O Nanak, there is no other at all.  || 37 ||   SHALOK: 
        The noose of Death is cut, and one's wanderings cease; victory
        is obtained, when one conquers his own mind. O Nanak, eternal
        stability is obtained from the Guru, and one's day-to-day
        wanderings cease.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  FAFFA:  After wandering
        and wandering for so long, you have come; in this Dark Age of
        Kali Yuga, you have obtained this human body, so very difficult
        to obtain. This opportunity shall not come into your hands again.
        So chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and the noose of Death
        shall be cut away. You shall not have to come and go in reincarnation
        over and over again, if you chant and meditate on the One and
        Only Lord. Shower Your Mercy, O God, Creator Lord, and unite poor
        Nanak with Yourself.  || 38 ||   SHALOK:  Hear my prayer, O Supreme
        Lord God, Merciful to the meek, Lord of the World. The dust of
        the feet of the Holy is peace, wealth, great enjoyment and pleasure
        for Nanak.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  BABBA:  One who knows God is a
        Brahmin. A Vaishnaav is one who, as Gurmukh, lives the righteous
        life of Dharma. One who eradicates his own evil is a brave warrior;
        no evil even approaches him. Man is bound by the chains of his
        own egotism, selfishness and conceit. The spiritually blind place
        the blame on others. But all debates and clever tricks are of
        no use at all. O Nanak, he alone comes to know, whom the Lord
        inspires to know.  || 39 ||   SHALOK:  The Destroyer of fear,
        the Eradicator of sin and sorrow  -  enshrine that Lord in
        your mind. One whose heart abides in the Society of the Saints,
        O Nanak, does not wander around in doubt.  || 1 ||   PAUREE: 
        BHABHA:  Cast out your doubt and delusion  -  this world is
        just a dream. The angelic beings, goddesses and gods are deluded
        by doubt. The Siddhas and seekers, and even Brahma are deluded
        by doubt. Wandering around, deluded by doubt, people are ruined.
        It is so very difficult and treacherous to cross over this ocean
        of Maya. That Gurmukh who has eradicated doubt, fear and attachment,
        O Nanak, obtains supreme peace.  || 40 ||   SHALOK:  Maya clings
        to the mind, and causes it to waver in so many ways. When You,
        O Lord, restrain someone from asking for wealth, then, O Nanak,
        he comes to love the Name.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  MAMMA:  The beggar
        is so ignorant  -  the Great Giver continues to give. He is
        All-knowing. Whatever He gives, He gives once and for all. O foolish
        mind, why do you complain, and cry out so loud? Whenever you ask
        for something, you ask for worldly things; no one has obtained
        happiness from these. If you must ask for a gift, then ask for
        the One Lord. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, by Him, you shall be saved.  || 41 ||   SHALOK:  Perfect
        is the intellect, and most distinguished is the reputation, of
        those whose minds are filled with the Mantra of the Perfect Guru.
        Those who come to know their God, O Nanak, are very fortunate.
        || 1 ||   PAUREE:  MAMMA:  Those who understand God's mystery
        are satisfied, joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
        They look upon pleasure and pain as the same. They are exempt
        from incarnation into heaven or hell. They live in the world,
        and yet they are detached from it. The Sublime Lord, the Primal
        Being, is totally pervading each and every heart. In His Love,
        they find peace. O Nanak, Maya does not cling to them at all.
        || 42 ||   SHALOK:  Listen, my dear friends and companions: without
        the Lord, there is no salvation. O Nanak, one who falls at the
        Feet of the Guru, has his bonds cut away.  || 1 ||   PAUREE: 
        YAYYA:  People try all sorts of things, but without the One Name,
        how far can they succeed? Those efforts, by which emancipation
        may be attained  -  those efforts are made in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. Everyone has this idea of salvation,
        but without meditation, there can be no salvation. The All-powerful
        Lord is the boat to carry us across. O Lord, please save these
        worthless beings! Those whom the Lord Himself instructs in thought,
        word and deed  -  O Nanak, their intellect is enlightened.
        || 43 ||   SHALOK:  Do not be angry with anyone else; look within
        your own self instead. Be humble in this world, O Nanak, and by
        His Grace you shall be carried across.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  RARRA:
        Be the dust under the feet of all. Give up your egotistical pride,
        and the balance of your account shall be written off. Then, you
        shall win the battle in the Court of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.
        As Gurmukh, lovingly attune yourself to the Lord's Name.
        Your evil ways shall be slowly and steadily blotted out, by the
        Shabad, the Incomparable Word of the Perfect Guru. You shall be
        imbued with the Lord's Love, and intoxicated with the Nectar
        of the Naam. O Nanak, the Lord, the Guru, has given this gift.
        || 44 ||   SHALOK:  The afflictions of greed, falsehood and corruption
        abide in this body. Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's
        Name, Har, Har, O Nanak, the Gurmukh abides in peace.  || 1 ||
        PAUREE:  LALLA:  One who takes the medicine of the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, is cured of his pain and sorrow in an instant.
        One whose heart is filled with the medicine of the Naam, is not
        infested with disease, even in his dreams. The medicine of the
        Lord's Name is in all hearts, O Siblings of Destiny. Without
        the Perfect Guru, no one knows how to prepare it. When the Perfect
        Guru gives the instructions to prepare it, then, O Nanak, one
        does not suffer illness again.  || 45 ||   SHALOK:  The All-pervading
        Lord is in all places. There is no place where He does not exist.
        Inside and outside, He is with you. O Nanak, what can be hidden
        from Him?  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  WAWWA:  Do not harbor hatred against
        anyone. In each and every heart, God is contained. The All-pervading
        Lord is permeating and pervading the oceans and the land. How
        rare are those who, by Guru's Grace, sing of Him. Hatred
        and alienation depart from those who, as Gurmukh, listen to the
        Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. </p>

        Har, Har, and rises above all social classes and status symbols.
        || 46 ||   SHALOK:  Acting in egotism, selfishness and conceit,
        the foolish, ignorant, faithless cynic wastes his life. He dies
        in agony, like one dying of thirst; O Nanak, this is because of
        the deeds he has done.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  RARRA:  Conflict is
        eliminated in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; meditate
        in adoration on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the essence of
        karma and Dharma. When the Beautiful Lord abides within the heart,
        conflict is erased and ended. The foolish, faithless cynic picks
        arguments  -  his heart is filled with corruption and egotistical
        intellect.  RARRA:  For the Gurmukh, conflict is eliminated in
        an instant, O Nanak, through the Teachings.  || 47 ||   SHALOK:
        O mind, grasp the Support of the Holy Saint; give up your clever
        arguments. One who has the Guru's Teachings within his mind,
        O Nanak, has good destiny inscribed upon his forehead.  || 1 ||
        PAUREE:  SASSA:  I have now entered Your Sanctuary, Lord; I
        am so tired of reciting the Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas.
        I searched and searched and searched, and now I have come to realize,
        that without meditating on the Lord, there is no emancipation.
        With each and every breath, I make mistakes. You are All-powerful,
        endless and infinite. I seek Your Sanctuary  -  please save
        me, Merciful Lord! Nanak is Your child, O Lord of the World. 
        || 48 ||   SHALOK:  When selfishness and conceit are erased, peace
        comes, and the mind and body are healed. O Nanak, then He comes
        to be seen  -  the One who is worthy of praise.  || 1 ||  
        PAUREE:  KHAKHA:  Praise and extol Him on High, who fills the
        empty to over-flowing in an instant. When the mortal being becomes
        totally humble, then he meditates night and day on God, the Detached
        Lord of Nirvaanaa. If it pleases the Will of our Lord and Master,
        then He blesses us with peace. Such is the Infinite, Supreme Lord
        God. He forgives countless sins in an instant. O Nanak, our Lord
        and Master is merciful forever.  || 49 ||   SHALOK:  I speak the
        Truth  -  listen, O my mind: take to the Sanctuary of the Sovereign
        Lord King. Give up all your clever tricks, O Nanak, and He shall
        absorb you into Himself.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  SASSA:  Give up your
        clever tricks, you ignorant fool! God is not pleased with clever
        tricks and commands. You may practice a thousand forms of cleverness,
        but not even one will go along with you in the end. Meditate on
        that Lord, that Lord, day and night. O soul, He alone shall go
        along with you. Those whom the Lord Himself commits to the service
        of the Holy, O Nanak, are not afflicted by suffering.  || 50 ||
        SHALOK:  Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and keeping
        it in your mind, you shall find peace. O Nanak, the Lord is pervading
        everywhere; He is contained in all spaces and interspaces.  ||
        1 ||   PAUREE:  Behold! The Lord God is totally pervading each
        and every heart. Forever and ever, the Guru's wisdom has
        been the Destroyer of pain. Quieting the ego, ecstasy is obtained.
        Where the ego does not exist, God Himself is there. The pain of
        birth and death is removed, by the power of the Society of the
        Saints. He becomes kind to those who lovingly enshrine the Name
        of the Merciful Lord within their hearts, in the Society of the
        Saints. <br>
