      <p> <font color="#000000">I am the hand-maiden of my Lord and Master.
        I have grasped the Feet of God, the Life of the world. He has
        killed and eradicated my egotism.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is
        the Perfect, Supreme Light, the Supreme Lord God, my Beloved,
        my Breath of Life. The Fascinating Lord has fascinated my mind;
        contemplating the Word of the Shabad, I have come to understand.
        || 1 ||   The worthless self-willed manmukh, with false and shallow
        understanding - his mind and body are held in pain's
        grip. Since I came to be imbued with the Love of my Beautiful
        Lord, I meditate on the Lord, and my mind is encouraged.  || 2
        ||   Abandoning egotism, I have become detached. And now, I absorb
        true intuitive understanding. The mind is pleased and appeased
        by the Pure, Immaculate Lord; the opinions of other people are
        irrelevant.  || 3 ||   There is no other like You, in the past
        or in the future, O my Beloved, my Breath of Life, my Support.
        The soul-bride is imbued with the Name of the Lord; O Nanak, the
        Lord is her Husband.  || 4 || 1 ||   SAARANG,  FIRST MEHL:  How
        can I survive without the Lord? I am suffering in pain. My tongue
        does not taste - all is bland without the Lord's
        sublime essence. Without God, I suffer and die.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   As long as I do not attain the Blessed Vision of my Beloved,
        I remain hungry and thirsty. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of
        His Darshan, my mind is pleased and appeased. The lotus blossoms
        forth in the water.  || 1 ||   The low-hanging clouds crack with
        thunder and burst. The cuckoos and the peacocks are filled with
        passion, along with the birds in the trees, the bulls and the
        snakes. The soul-bride is happy when her Husband Lord returns
        home.  || 2 ||   She is filthy and ugly, unfeminine and ill-mannered
        - she has no intuitive understanding of her Husband Lord.
        She is not satisfied by the sublime essence of her Lord's
        Love; she is evil-minded, immersed in her pain.  || 3 ||   The
        soul-bride does not come and go in reincarnation or suffer in
        pain; her body is not touched by the pain of disease. O Nanak,
        she is intuitively embellished by God; seeing God, her mind is
        encouraged.  || 4 || 2 ||   SAARANG,  FIRST MEHL:  My Beloved
        Lord God is not far away. My mind is pleased and appeased by the
        Word of the True Guru's Teachings. <br>

      <p> I have found the Lord, the Support of my breath of life.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   This is the way to meet your Husband Lord. Blessed
        is the soul-bride who is loved by her Husband Lord. Social class
        and status, race, ancestry and skepticism are eliminated, following
        the Guru's Teachings and contemplating the Word of the
        Shabad.  || 1 ||   One whose mind is pleased and appeased, has
        no egotistical pride. Violence and greed are forgotten. The soul-bride
        intuitively ravishes and enjoys her Husband Lord; as Gurmukh,
        she is embellished by His Love.  || 2 ||   Burn away any love
        of family and relatives, which increases your attachment to Maya.
        One who does not savor the Lord's Love deep within, lives
        in duality and corruption.  || 3 ||   His Love is a priceless
        jewel deep within my being; the Lover of my Beloved is not hidden.
        O Nanak, as Gurmukh, enshrine the Priceless Naam deep within your
        being, all the ages through.  || 4 || 3 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">I am the dust of the feet of the humble Saints
        of the Lord. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I
        have obtained the supreme status. The Lord, the Supreme Soul,
        is all-pervading everywhere.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meeting the
        Saintly True Guru, I have found peace and tranquility. Sinful
        residues and painful mistakes are totally erased and taken away.
        The Divine Light of the soul radiates forth, gazing upon the Presence
        of the Immaculate Lord God.  || 1 ||   By great good fortune,
        I have found the Sat Sangat; the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is
        all-prevading everywhere. I have taken my cleansing bath at the
        sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, bathing in the dust
        of the feet of the True Congregation.  || 2 ||   Evil-minded and
        corrupt, filthy-minded and shallow, with impure heart, attached
        to enticement and falsehood. Without good karma, how can I find
        the Sangat? Engrossed in egotism, the mortal remains stuck in
        regret.  || 3 ||   Be kind and show Your Mercy, O Dear Lord; I
        beg for the dust of the feet of the Sat Sangat. O Nanak, meeting
        with the Saints, the Lord is attained. The Lord's humble
        servant obtains the Presence of the Lord.  || 4 || 1 ||   SAARANG,
        FOURTH MEHL:  I am a sacrifice to the Feet of the Lord of the
        Universe. I cannot swim across the terrifying world ocean. But
        chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am carried across across.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Faith in God came to fill my heart; I serve
        Him intuitively, and contemplate Him. Night and day, I chant the
        Lord's Name within my heart; it is all-powerful and virtuous.
        || 1 ||   God is Inaccessible and Unfathomable, All-pervading
        everywhere, in all minds and bodies; He is Infinite and Invisible.
        When the Guru bebomes merciful, then the Unseen Lord is seen within
        the heart.  || 2 ||   Deep within the inner being is the Name
        of the Lord, the Support of the entire earth, but to the egotistical
        shaakta, the faithless cynic, He seems far away. His burning desire
        is never quenched, and he loses the game of life in the gamble.
        || 3 ||   Standing up and sitting down, the mortal sings the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord, when the Guru bestows even a tiny
        bit of His Grace. <br>

      <p> O Nanak, those who are blessed by His Glance of Grace -
        He saves and protects their honor.  || 4 || 2 ||   SAARANG,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  O my Beloved Lord, Har, Har, please bless me with Your
        Ambrosial Name. Those whose minds are pleased to be Gurmukh -
        the Lord completes their projects.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those
        humble beings who become meek before the Guru-their pains are
        taken away. Night and day, they perform devotional worship services
        to the Guru; they are embellished with the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 1 ||   Within their hearts is the ambrosial essence
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they savor this essence, sing
        the praises of this essence, and contemplate this essence. By
        Guru's Grace, they are aware of this ambrosial essence;
        they find the Gate of Salvation.  || 2 ||   The True is the Primal
        Being, Unmoving and Unchanging. One who takes the Support of the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord - his intellect becomes focused
        and steady. I offer my soul to Him; I am a sacrifice to my True
        Guru.  || 3 ||   The self-willed manmukhs are stuck in doubt and
        attached to duality; the darkness of spiritual ignorance is within
        them. They do not see the True Guru, the Giver; they are not on
        this shore, or the other.  || 4 ||   Our Lord and Master is permeating
        and pervading each and every heart; He is supremely Potent to
        exercise His Might. Nanak, the slave of His slaves, says, please,
        be merciful and save me!  || 5 || 3 ||   SAARANG,  FOURTH MEHL:
        This is the way to work for the Lord. Whatever He does, accept
        that as true. As Gurmukh, remain lovingly absorbed in His Name.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Love of the Lord of the Universe seems
        supremely sweet. Everything else is forgotten. Night and day,
        he is in ecstasy; his mind is pleased and appeased, and his light
        merges into the Light.  || 1 ||   Singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, his mind is satisfied. Peace and tranquility come
        to abide within his mind. When the Guru becomes merciful, the
        mortal finds the Lord; he focuses his consciousness on the Lord's
        Lotus Feet.  || 2 ||   The intellect is enlightened, meditating
        on the Lord. He remains lovingly attuned to the essence of spiritual
        wisdom. The Divine Light radiates forth deep within his being;
        his mind is pleased and appeased. He merges intuitively into Celestial
        Samaadhi.  || 3 ||   One whose heart is filled with falsehood,
        continues to practice falsehood, even while he teaches and preaches
        about the Lord. Within him is the utter darkness of greed. He
        is thrashed like wheat, and suffers in pain.  || 4 ||   When my
        God is totally pleased, the mortal tunes in and becomes Gurmukh.
        Nanak has obtained the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        Chanting the Naam, he has found peace.  || 5 || 4 ||   SAARANG,
        FOURTH MEHL:  My mind is pleased and appeased by the Name of
        the Lord. The True Guru has implanted divine love within my heart.
        The Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Please be merciful to Your meek and humble servant;
        please bless Your humble servant with Your Unspoken Speech. Meeting
        with the humble Saints, I have found the sublime essence of the
        Lord. The Lord seems so sweet to my mind and body.  || 1 ||  
        They alone are unattached, who are imbued with the Lord's
        Love; through the Guru's Teachings, they realize the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Meeting with the Primal Being, one finds
        peace, and one's comings and goings in reincarnation are
        ended.  || 2 ||   With my eyes, I gaze lovingly upon God, my Lord
        and Master. <br>

      <p> I chant His Name with my tongue. With my ears, I listen to the
        Kirtan of His Praises, day and night. I love the Lord, Har, Har,
        with all my heart.  || 3 ||   When the Guru helped me to overcome
        the five thieves, then I found ultimate bliss, attached to the
        Naam. The Lord has showered His Mercy on servant Nanak; he merges
        in the Lord, in the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 5 ||   SAARANG,
        FOURTH MEHL:  O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and study
        His Excellence. Without the Lord's Name, nothing is steady
        or stable. All the rest of the show is useless.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   What is there to accept, and what is there to reject, O
        madman? Whatever is seen shall turn to dust. That poison which
        you believe to be your own - you must abandon it and leave
        it behind. What a load you have to carry on your head!  || 1 ||
        Moment by moment, instant by instant, your life is running out.
        The fool cannot understand this. He does things which will not
        go along with him in the end. This is the lifestyle of the faithless
        cynic.  || 2 ||   So join together with the humble Saints, O madman,
        and you shall find the Gate of Salvation. Without the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, no one finds any peace. Go and ask the
        scholars of the Vedas.  || 3 ||   All the kings and queens shall
        depart; they must leave this false expanse. O Nanak, the Saints
        are eternally steady and stable; they take the Support of the
        Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 6 || <br>

        beings. Chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, the Lord, my most
        Dear Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That household, in which the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung, in which the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord are sung, in which His Glorious Praises are sung,
        where the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds, resound -
        great is the destiny written on the forehead of one who lives
        in such a household. All the sins of that humble being are taken
        away, all the pains are taken away, all diseases are taken away;
        sexual desire, anger, greed, attachment and egotistical pride
        are taken away. The Lord drives the five thieves out of such a
        person of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Chant the Name of the Lord, O Holy
        Saints of the Lord; meditate on the Lord of the Universe, O Holy
        people of the Lord. Meditate in thought, word and deed on the
        Lord, Har, Har. Worship and adore the Lord, O Holy people of the
        Lord. Chant the Name of the Lord, chant the Name of the Lord.
        It shall rid you of all your sins. Continually and continuously
        remain awake and aware. You shall be in ecstasy forever and ever,
        meditating on the Lord of the Universe. Servant Nanak: O Lord,
        Your devotees obtain the fruits of their minds' desires;
        they obtain all the fruits and rewards, and the four great blessings
        - Dharmic faith, wealth and riches, sexual success and
        liberation.  || 2 || 2 || 9 ||   SAARANG,  FOURTH MEHL:  O my
        mind, meditate on the Lord, the Lord of Wealth, the Source of
        Nectar, the Supreme Lord God, the True Transcendent Being, God,
        the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. He is the Destroyer
        of all suffering, the Giver of all peace; sing the Praises of
        my Beloved Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord dwells in
        the home of each and every heart. The Lord dwells in the water,
        and the Lord dwells on the land. The Lord dwells in the spaces
        and interspaces. I have such a great longing to see the Lord.
        If only some Saint, some humble Saint of the Lord, my Holy Beloved,
        would come, to show me the way. I would wash and massage the feet
        of that humble being.  || 1 ||   The Lord's humble servant
        meets the Lord, through his faith in the Lord; meeting the Lord,
        he becomes Gurmukh. My mind and body are in ecstasy; I have seen
        my Sovereign Lord King. Servant Nanak has been blessed with Grace,
        blessed with the Lord's Grace, blessed with the Grace of
        the Lord of the Universe. I meditate on the Lord, the Name of
        the Lord, night and day, forever, forever and ever.  || 2 || 3
        || 10 ||   SAARANG,  FOURTH MEHL:  O my mind, meditate on the
        Fearless Lord, who is True, True, Forever True. He is free of
        vengeance, the Image of the Undying, beyond birth, Self-existent.
        O my mind, meditate night and day on the Formless, Self-sustaining
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   For the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan, for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan,
        the thirty-three million gods, and millions of Siddhas, celibates
        and Yogis make their pilgrimages to sacred shrines and rivers,
        and go on fasts. The service of the humble person is approved,
        unto whom the Lord of the World shows His Mercy.  || 1 ||   They
        alone are the good Saints of the Lord, the best and most exalted
        devotees, who are pleasing to their Lord. <br>

      <p> Those who have my Lord and Master on their side - O Nanak,
        the Lord saves their honor.  || 2 || 4 || 11 ||   SAARANG,  FOURTH
        MEHL,  PARTAAL:  O my mind, meditate on the Lord of the Universe,
        the Lord, the Lord of the Universe, the Treasure of Virtue, the
        God of all creation. O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the
        Lord, the Eternal, Imperishable, Primal Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Name of the Lord is the Ambrosial Nectar, Har, Har,
        Har. He alone drinks it in, whom the Lord inspires to drink it.
        The Merciful Lord Himself bestows His Mercy, and He leads the
        mortal to meet with the True Guru. That humble being tastes the
        Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   Those who serve
        my Lord, forever and ever - all their pain, doubt and fear
        are taken away. Servant Nanak chants the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, and so he lives, like the song-bird, which is satisfied
        only by drinking in the water.  || 2 || 5 || 12 ||   SAARANG,
        FOURTH MEHL:  O my mind, meditate on the Supreme Lord. The Lord,
        the Lord is All-pervading. True, True is the Lord. O Siblings
        of Destiny, chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, forever.
        He is All-pervading everywhere.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord
        Himself is Himself the Creator of all. The Lord Himself is Himself
        pervading the whole world. That person, upon whom my Sovereign
        Lord King, Raam, Raam, Raam, bestows His Mercy - that person
        is lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   O Saints
        of the Lord, behold the Glory of the Name of the Lord; His Name
        saves the honor of His humble devotees in this Dark Age of Kali
        Yuga. My Sovereign Lord King has taken servant Nanak's
        side; his enemies and attackers have all run away.  || 2 || 6

      <p> <font color="#000000">I am a sacrifice to the Image of the True
        Guru. My inner being is filled with a great thirst, like that
        of the song-bird for water. When shall I find the Fruitful Vision
        of His Darshan?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is the Master of the
        masterless, the Cherisher of all. He is the Lover of the devotees
        of His Name. That mortal, whom no one can protect - You
        bless him with Your Support, O Lord.  || 1 ||   Support of the
        unsupported, Saving Grace of the unsaved, Home of the homeless.
        Wherever I go in the ten directions, You are there with me. The
        only thing I do is sing the Kirtan of Your Praises.  || 2 || 
        From Your Oneness, You become tens of thousands, and from tens
        of thousands, You become One. I cannot describe Your state and
        extent. You are Infinite - Your value cannot be appraised.
        Everything I see is Your play.  || 3 ||   I speak with the Company
        of the Holy; I am in love with the Holy people of the Lord. Servant
        Nanak has found the Lord through the Guru's Teachings;
        please bless me with Your Blessed Vision; O Lord, my mind yearns
        for it.  || 4 || 1 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Dear Lord is
        the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. The mortal does evil
        deeds, and hides from others, but like the air, the Lord is present
        everywhere.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You call yourself a devotee
        of Vishnu and you practice the six rituals, but your inner being
        is polluted with greed. <br>

      <p> Those who slander the Society of the Saints, shall all be drowned
        in their ignorance.  || 1 ||   The mortal eats the food which
        he has carefully prepared, and then steals the wealth of others.
        His inner being is filled with falsehood and pride. He knows nothing
        of the Vedas or the Shaastras; his mind is gripped by pride. 
        || 2 ||   He says his evening prayers, and observes all the fasts,
        but this is all just a show. God made him stray from the path,
        and sent him into the wilderness. All his actions are useless.
        || 3 ||   He alone is a spiritual teacher, and he alone is a
        devotee of Vishnu and a scholar, whom the Lord God blesses with
        His Grace. Serving the True Guru, he obtains the supreme status
        and saves the whole world.  || 4 ||   What can I say? I don't
        know what to say. As God wills, so do I speak. I ask only for
        the dust of the feet of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
        Servant Nanak seeks their Sanctuary.  || 5 || 2 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Now, my dancing is over. I have intuitively obtained
        my Darling Beloved. Through the Word of the True Guru's
        Teachings, I found Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The virgin speaks
        with her friends about her husband and they laugh together; but
        when he comes home, she becomes shy, and modestly covers her face.
        || 1 ||   When gold is melted in the crucible, it flows freely
        everywhere. But when it is made into pure solid bars of gold,
        then it remains stationary.  || 2 ||   As long as the days and
        the nights of one's life last, the clock strikes the hours,
        minutes and seconds. But when the gong player gets up and leaves,
        the gong is not sounded again.  || 3 ||   When the pitcher is
        filled with water, the water contained within it seems distinct.
        Says Nanak, when the pitcher is emptied out, the water mingles
        again with water.  || 4 || 3 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Now if
        he is asked, what can he say? He was supposed to have gathered
        the sublime essence of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        but instead, the mad-man was busy with poison.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   This human life, so difficult to obtain, was finally obtained
        after such a long time. He is losing it in exchange for a shell.
        He came to buy musk, but instead, he has loaded dust and thistle
        grass.  || 1 ||   He comes in search of profits, but he is entangled
        in the enticing illusion of Maya. He loses the jewel, in exchange
        for mere glass. When will he have this blessed opportunity again?
        || 2 ||   He is full of sins, and he has not even one redeeming
        virtue. Forsaking his Lord and Master, he is involved with Maya,
        God's slave. And when the final silence comes, like inanimate
        matter, he is caught like a thief at the door.  || 3 ||   I cannot
        see any other way out. I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord's
        slaves. Says Nanak, the mortal is emancipated, only when all his
        demerits and faults are erased and eradicated.  || 4 || 4 || 
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, my patience is gone. I am in
        love with my Husband Lord. There are so many kinds of incomparable
        pleasures, but I am not interested in any of them.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Night and day, I utter, &quot;Pri-a, Pri-a - Beloved,
        Beloved&quot; with my mouth. I cannot sleep, even for an instant;
        I remain awake and aware. Necklaces, eye make-up, fancy clothes
        and decorations - without my Husband Lord, these are all
        poison to me. <br>

      <p> || 1 ||   I ask and ask, with humility, &quot;Who can tell me
        which country my Husband Lord lives in?&quot; I would dedicate
        my heart to him, I offer my mind and body and everything; I place
        my head at his feet.  || 2 ||   I bow at the feet of the voluntary
        slave of the Lord; I beg him to bless me with the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy.  Show Mercy to me, that I may meet God,
        and gaze upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan every moment.
        || 3 ||   When He is Kind to me, He comes to dwell within my
        being. Night and day, my mind is calm and peaceful. Says Nanak,
        I sing the Songs of Joy; the Unstruck Word of the Shabad resounds
        within me.  || 4 || 5 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, True,
        True True is the Lord, and True, True, True is His Holy Saint.
        The Word which the Perfect Guru has spoken, I have tied to my
        robe.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Night and day, and the stars in the
        sky shall vanish. The sun and the moon shall vanish. The mountains,
        the earth, the water and the air shall pass away. Only the Word
        of the Holy Saint shall endure.  || 1 ||   Those born of eggs
        shall pass away, and those born of the womb shall pass away. Those
        born of the earth and sweat shall pass away as well. The four
        Vedas shall pass away, and the six Shaastras shall pass away.
        Only the Word of the Holy Saint is eternal.  || 2 ||   Raajas,
        the quality of energetic activity shall pass away. Taamas, the
        quality of lethargic darkness shall pass away. Saatvas, the quality
        of peaceful light shall pass away as well. All that is seen shall
        pass away. Only the Word of the Holy Saint is beyond destruction.
        || 3 ||   He Himself is Himself by Himself. All that is seen
        is His play. He cannot be found by any means. O Nanak, meeting
        with the Guru, God is found.  || 4 || 6 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, dwells within my mind. Wherever
        my Lord and Master is remembered in meditation - that village
        is filled with peace and bliss.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Wherever
        my Beloved Lord and Master is forgotten - all misery and
        misfortune is there. Where the Praises of my Lord, the Embodiment
        of Bliss and Joy are sung - eternal peace and wealth are
        there.  || 1 ||   Wherever they do not listen to the Stories of
        the Lord with their ears - the utterly desolate wilderness
        is there. Where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung
        with love in the Saadh Sangat - there is fragrance and
        fruit and joy in abundance.  || 2 ||   Without meditative remembrance
        on the Lord, one may live for millions of years, but his life
        would be totally useless. But if he vibrates and meditates on
        the Lord of the Universe, for even a moment, then he shall live
        forever and ever.  || 3 ||   O God, I seek Your Sanctuary, Your
        Sanctuary, Your Sanctuary; please mercifully bless me with the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. O Nanak, the Lord is All-pervading
        everywhere, amongst all. He knows the qualities and the condition
        of all.  || 4 || 7 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Now, I have obtained
        the Support of the Lord. Those who seek the Sanctuary of the Ocean
        of Mercy are carried across the world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   They sleep in peace, and intuitively merge into the Lord.
        The Guru takes away their cynicism and doubt. Whatever they wish
        for, the Lord does; they obtain the fruits of their minds'
        desires.  || 1 ||   In my heart, I meditate on Him; with my eyes,
        I focus my meditation on Him. <br>

      <p> With my ears, I listen to His Sermon. With my feet, I walk on
        my Lord and Mater's Path. With my tongue, I sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord.  || 2 ||   With my eyes, I see the Lord,
        the Embodiment of Absolute Bliss; the Saint has turned away from
        the world. I have found the Priceless Name of the Beloved Lord;
        it never leaves me or goes anywhere else.  || 3 ||   What praise,
        what glory and what virtues should I utter, in order to please
        the Lord? That humble being, unto whom the Merciful Lord is kind
        - O servant Nanak, he is the slave of God's slaves.
        || 4 || 8 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Who can I tell, and with
        whom can I speak, about this state of peace and bliss? I am in
        ecstasy and delight, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of God's
        Darshan. My mind sings His Songs of Joy and His Glories.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   I am wonderstruck, gazing upon the Wondrous Lord.
        The Merciful Lord is All-pervading everywhere. I drink in the
        Invaluable Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Like the
        mute, I can only smile - I cannot speak of its flavor.
        || 1 ||   As the breath is held in bondage, no one can understand
        its coming in and going out. So is that person, whose heart is
        enlightened by the Lord - his story cannot be told.  ||
        2 ||   As many other efforts as you can think of - I have
        seen them and studied them all. My Beloved, Carefree Lord has
        revealed Himself within the home of my own heart; thus I have
        realized the Inaccessible Lord.  || 3 ||   The Absolute, Formless,
        Eternally Unchanging, Immeasurable Lord cannot be masured. Says
        Nanak, whoever endures the unendurable - this state belongs
        to him alone.  || 4 || 9 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The corrupt
        person passes his days and nights uselessly. He does not vibrate
        and meditate on the Lord of the Universe; he is intoxicated with
        egotistical intellect. He loses his life in the gamble.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is priceless,
        but he is not in love with it. He loves only to slander others.
        Weaving the grass, he builds his house of straw. At the door,
        he builds a fire.  || 1 ||   He carries a load of sulfur on his
        head, and drives the Ambrosial Nectar out of his mind. Wearing
        his good clothes, the mortal falls into the coal-pit; again and
        again, he tries to shake it off.  || 2 ||   Standing on the branch,
        eating and eating and smiling, he cuts down the tree. He falls
        down head-first and is shattered into bits and pieces.  || 3 ||
        He bears vengeance against the Lord who is free of vengeance.
        The fool is not up to the task. Says Nanak, the Saving Grace of
        the Saints is the Formless, Supreme Lord God.  || 4 || 10 || 
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  All the others are deluded by doubt; they
        do not understand. That person, within whose heart the One Pure
        Word abides, realizes the essence of the Vedas.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   He walks in the ways of the world, trying to please people.
        But as long as his heart is not enlightened, he is stuck in pitch
        black darkness.  || 1 ||   The land may be prepared in every way,
        but nothing sprouts without being planted. Just so, without the
        Lord's Name, no one is liberated, nor is egotistical pride
        eradicated.  || 2 ||   The mortal may churn water until he is
        sore, but how can butter be produced? <br>

      <p> Without meeting the Guru, no one is liberated, and the Lord of
        the Universe is not met.  || 3 ||   Searching and searching, I
        have come to this realization: all peace and bliss are in the
        Name of the Lord. Says Nanak, he alone receives it, upon whose
        forehead such destiny is inscribed.  || 4 || 11 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Night and day, utter the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord. You shall obtain all wealth, all pleasures and successes,
        and the fruits of your mind's desires.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Come, O Saints, let us meditate in remembrance on God; He
        is the Eternal, Imperishable Giver of Peace and Praanaa, the Breath
        of Life. Master of the masterless, Destroyer of the pains of the
        meek and the poor; He is All-pervading and permeating, abiding
        in all hearts.  || 1 ||   The very fortunate ones drink in the
        Sublime Essence of the Lord, singing, reciting and listening to
        the Lord's Praises. All their sufferings and struggles
        are wiped away from their bodies; they remain lovingly awake and
        aware in the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   So abandon your sexual
        desire, greed, falsehood and slander; meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord, you shall be released from bondage. The intoxication
        of loving attachments, egotism and blind possessiveness are eradicated
        by Guru's Grace.  || 3 ||   You are All-Powerful, O Supreme
        Lord God and Master; please be Merciful to Your humble servant.
        My Lord and Master is All-pervading and prevailing everywhere;
        O Nanak, God is Near.  || 4 || 12 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        I am a sacrifice to the Feet of the Divine Guru. I meditate with
        Him on the Supreme Lord God; His Teachings have emancipated me.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All pains, diseases and fears are erased,
        for one who comes to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Saints.
        He Himself chants, and inspires others to chant the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord. He is Utterly All-Powerful; He carries us across
        to the other side.  || 1 ||   His Mantra drives out cynicism,
        and totally fills the empty one. Those who obey the Order of the
        Lord's slaves, do not enter into the womb of reincarnation
        ever again.  || 2 ||   Whoever works for the Lord's devotees
        and sings His Praises - his pains of birth and death are
        taken away. Those unto whom my Beloved becomes Merciful, endure
        the Unendurable Ecstasy of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   Those
        who are satisfied by the Sublime Essence of the Lord, merge intuitively
        into the Lord; no mouth can describe their state. By Guru's
        Grace, O Nanak, they are content; chanting and meditating on God's
        Name, they are saved.  || 4 || 13 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        I sing, O I sing the Songs of Joy of my Lord, the Treasure of
        Virtue. Fortunate is the time, fortunate is the day and the moment,
        when I become pleasing to the Lord of the World.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I touch my forehead to the Feet of the Saints. The Saints
        have placed their hands on my forehead.  || 1 ||   My mind is
        filled with the Mantra of the Holy Saints, and I have risen above
        the three qualities  || 2 ||   Gazing upon the Blessed Vision,
        the Darshan of God's devotees, my eyes are filled with
        love. Greed and attachment are gone, along with doubt.  || 3 ||
        Says Nanak, I have found intuitive peace, poise and bliss. Tearing
        down the wall, I have met the Lord, the Embodiment of Supreme
        Bliss.  || 4 || 14 || <br>

        so thirsty for the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of my Enticing
        and Lovely Beloved. My mind cannot survive - it yearns
        for Him in so many ways. <br>

      <p> || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I think thoughts of Him; I miss the Love
        of my Beloved. When will I obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan? I try, but this mind is not encouraged. Is there any
        Saint who can lead me to God?  || 1 ||   Chanting, penance, self-control,
        good deeds and charity - I sacrifice all these in fire;
        I dedicate all peace and places to Him. One who helps me to behold
        the Blessed Vision of my Beloved, for even an instant -
        I am a sacrifice to that Saint.  || 2 ||   I offer all my prayers
        and entreaties to him; I serve him, day and night. I have renounced
        all pride and egotism; he tells me the stories of my Beloved.
        || 3 ||   I am wonder-struck, gazing upon the wondrous play of
        God. The Guru, the True Guru, has led me to meet the Primal Lord.
        I have found God, my Merciful Loving Lord, within the home of
        my own heart. O Nanak, the fire within me has been quenched. 
        || 4 || 1|| 15 ||   You fool, why are you not meditating on the
        Lord now? In the awful hell of the fire of the womb, you did penance,
        upside-down; each and every instant, you sang His Glorious Praises.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You wandered through countless incarnations,
        until finally you attained this priceless human birth. Leaving
        the womb, you were born, and when you came out, you became attached
        to other places.  || 1 ||   You practiced evil and fraud day and
        night, and did useless deeds. You thrash the straw, but it has
        no wheat; running around and hurrying, you obtain only pain. 
        || 2 ||   The false person is attached to falsehood; he is entangled
        with transitory things. And when the Righteous Judge of Dharma
        seizes you, O madman, you shall arise and depart with your face
        blackened.  || 3 ||   He alone meets with God, whom God Himself
        meets, by such pre-ordained destiny written on his forehead. Says
        Nanak, I am a sacrifice to that humble being, who remains unattached
        within his mind.  || 4 || 2 || 16 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        How can I live without my Beloved, O my mother? Separated from
        Him, the mortal becomes a corpse, and is not allowed to remain
        within the house.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is the Giver of the
        soul, the heart, the breath of life. Being with Him, we are embellished
        with joy. Please bless me with Your Gace, O Saint, that I may
        sing the songs of joyful praise to my God.  || 1 ||   I touch
        my forehead to the feet of the Saints. My eyes long for their
        dust. By His Grace, we meet God; O Nanak, I am a sacrifice, a
        sacrifice to Him.  || 2 || 3 || 17 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        I am a sacrifice to that occasion. Twenty-four hours a day, I
        meditate in remembrance on my God; by great good fortune, I have
        found the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Kabeer is good, the slave
        of the Lord's slaves; the humble barber Sain is sublime.
        Highest of the high is Naam Dayv, who looked upon all alike; Ravi
        Daas was in tune with the Lord.  ||1 ||   My soul, body and wealth
        belong to the Saints; my mind longs for the dust of the Saints.
        And by the radiant Grace of the Saints, all my doubts have been
        erased. O Nanak, I have met the Lord.  || 2 || 4 || 18 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The True Guru fulfills the mind's desires. </p>
