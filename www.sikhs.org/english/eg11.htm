      <p> 6 ||   The wealth of the self-willed manmukhs is false, and false
        is their ostentatious display. They practice falsehood, and suffer
        terrible pain. Deluded by doubt, they wander day and night; through
        birth and death, they lose their lives.  || 7 ||   My True Lord
        and Master is very dear to me. The Shabad of the Perfect Guru
        is my Support. O Nanak, one who obtains the Greatness of the Naam,
        looks upon pain and pleasure as one and the same.  || 8 || 10
        || 11 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The four sources of creation are
        Yours; the spoken word is Yours. Without the Name, all are deluded
        by doubt. Serving the Guru, the Lord's Name is obtained.
        Without the True Guru, no one can receive it.  || 1 ||   I am
        a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who focus their
        consciousness on the Lord. Through devotion to the Guru, the True
        One is found; He comes to abide in the mind, with intuitive ease.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Serving the True Guru, all things are obtained.
        As are the desires one harbors, so are the rewards one receives.
        The True Guru is the Giver of all things; through perfect destiny,
        He is met.  || 2 ||   This mind is filthy and polluted; it does
        not meditate on the One. Deep within, it is soiled and stained
        by the love of duality. The egotists may go on pilgrimages to
        holy rivers, sacred shrines and foreign lands, but they only gather
        more of the dirt of egotism.  || 3 ||   Serving the True Guru,
        filth and pollution are removed. Those who focus their consciousness
        on the Lord remain dead while yet alive. The True Lord is Pure;
        no filth sticks to Him. Those who are attached to the True One
        have their filth washed away.  || 4 ||   Without the Guru, there
        is only pitch darkness. The ignorant ones are blind - there
        is only utter darkness for them. The maggots in manure do filthy
        deeds, and in filth they rot and putrefy. Serving the Lord of
        Liberation, liberation is achieved. The Word of the Shabad eradicates
        egotism and possessiveness. So serve the Dear True Lord, night
        and day. By perfect good destiny, the Guru is found.  || 6 ||
        He Himself forgives and unites in His Union. From the Perfect
        Guru, the Treasure of the Naam is obtained. By the True Name,
        the mind is made true forever. Serving the True Lord, sorrow is
        driven out.  || 7 ||   He is always close at hand - do not
        think that He is far away. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, recognize the Lord deep within your own being. O Nanak,
        through the Naam, glorious greatness is received. Through the
        Perfect Guru, the Naam is obtained.  || 8 || 11 || 12 ||   MAAJH,
        THIRD MEHL:  Those who are True here, are True hereafter as well.
        That mind is true, which is attuned to the True Shabad. They serve
        the True One, and practice Truth; they earn Truth, and only Truth.
        || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those
        whose minds are filled with the True Name. They serve the True
        One, and are absorbed into the True One, singing the Glorious
        Praises of the True One.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Pandits, the
        religious scholars read, but they do not taste the essence. In
        love with duality and Maya, their minds wander, unfocused. The
        love of Maya has displaced all their understanding; making mistakes,
        they live in regret. But if they should meet the True Guru, then
        they obtain the essence of reality; the Name of the Lord comes
        to dwell in their minds. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Those who die in the Shabad and subdue their own minds, obtain
        the door of liberation.  || 3 ||   They erase the residues of
        their sinful mistakes, and eliminate their anger; they keep the
        Guru's Shabad clasped tightly to their hearts. Those who
        are attuned to Truth, remain balanced and detached forever. Subduing
        their egotism, they are united with the Lord.  || 4 ||   Deep
        within the nucleus of the self is the jewel; we receive it only
        if the Lord inspires us to receive it. The mind is bound by the
        three dispositions - the three modes of Maya. Reading and reciting,
        the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the silent sages have
        grown weary, but they have not found the supreme essence of the
        fourth state.  || 5 ||   The Lord Himself dyes us in the color
        of His Love. Only those who are steeped in the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad are so imbued with His Love. Imbued with the most beautiful
        color of the Lord's Love, they sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, with great pleasure and joy.  || 6 ||   To the Gurmukh,
        the True Lord is wealth, miraculous spiritual powers and strict
        self-discipline. Through the spiritual wisdom of the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, the Gurmukh is liberated. The Gurmukh practices
        Truth, and is absorbed in the Truest of the True.  || 7 ||   The
        Gurmukh realizes that the Lord alone creates, and having created,
        He destroys. To the Gurmukh, the Lord Himself is social class,
        status and all honor. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam;
        through the Naam, they merge in the Naam.  || 8 || 12 || 13 ||
        MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  Creation and destruction happen through
        the Word of the Shabad. Through the Shabad, creation happens again.
        The Gurmukh knows that the True Lord is all-pervading. The Gurmukh
        understands creation and merger.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Perfect Guru
        within their minds. From the Guru comes peace and tranquility;
        worship Him with devotion, day and night. Chanting His Glorious
        Praises, merge into the Glorious Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        Gurmukh sees the Lord on the earth, and the Gurmukh sees Him in
        the water. The Gurmukh sees Him in wind and fire; such is the
        wonder of His Play. One who has no Guru, dies over and over again,
        only to be re-born. One who has no Guru continues coming and going
        in reincarnation.  || 2 ||   The One Creator has set this play
        in motion. In the frame of the human body, He has placed all things.
        Those few who are pierced through by the Word of the Shabad, obtain
        the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. He calls them into His
        Wondrous Palace.  || 3 ||   True is the Banker, and true are His
        traders. They purchase Truth, with infinite love for the Guru.
        They deal in Truth, and they practice Truth. They earn Truth,
        and only Truth.  || 4 ||   Without investment capital, how can
        anyone acquire merchandise? The self-willed manmukhs have all
        gone astray. Without true wealth, everyone goes empty-handed;
        going empty-handed, they suffer in pain.  || 5 ||   Some deal
        in Truth, through love of the Guru's Shabad. They save themselves,
        and save all their ancestors as well. Very auspicious is the coming
        of those who meet their Beloved and find peace.  || 6 ||   Deep
        within the self is the secret, but the fool looks for it outside.
        The blind self-willed manmukhs wander around like demons; but
        where the secret is, there, they do not find it. The manmukhs
        are deluded by doubt.  || 7 ||   He Himself calls us, and bestows
        the Word of the Shabad. The soul-bride finds intuitive peace and
        poise in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. O Nanak, she
        obtains the glorious greatness of the Naam; she hears it again
        and again, and she meditates on it.  || 8 || 13 || 14 ||   MAAJH,
        THIRD MEHL:  The True Guru has imparted the True Teachings. </p>

      <p> Think of the Lord, who shall be your Help and Support in the end.
        The Lord is Inaccessible and Incomprehensible. He has no master,
        and He is not born. He is obtained through love of the True Guru.
        || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those
        who eliminate selfishness and conceit. They eradicate selfishness
        and conceit, and then find the Lord; they are intuitively immersed
        in the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   According to their pre-ordained
        destiny, they act out their karma. Serving the True Guru, a lasting
        peace is found. Without good fortune, the Guru is not found. Through
        the Word of the Shabad, they are united in the Lord's Union.
        || 2 ||   The Gurmukhs remain unaffected in the midst of the
        world. The Guru is their cushion, and the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is their Support. Who can oppress the Gurmukh? One who tries
        shall perish, writhing in pain.  || 3 ||   The blind self-willed
        manmukhs have no understanding at all. They are the assassins
        of the self, and the butchers of the world. By continually slandering
        others, they carry a terrible load, and they carry the loads of
        others for nothing.  || 4 ||   This world is a garden, and my
        Lord God is the Gardener. He always takes care of it - nothing
        is exempt from His Care. As is the fragrance which He bestows,
        so is the fragrant flower known.  || 5 ||   The self-willed manmukhs
        are sick and diseased in the world. They have forgotten the Giver
        of peace, the Unfathomable, the Infinite. These miserable people
        wander endlessly, crying out in pain; without the Guru, they find
        no peace.  || 6 ||   The One who created them, knows their condition.
        And if He inspires them, then they realize the Hukam of His Command.
        Whatever He places within them, that is what prevails, and so
        they outwardly appear.  || 7 ||   I know of no other except the
        True One. Those, whom the Lord attaches to Himself, become pure.
        O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the
        heart of those, unto whom He has given it.  || 8 || 14 || 15 ||
        MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  Enshrining the Ambrosial Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, in the mind, all the pains of egotism, selfishness
        and conceit are eliminated. By continually praising the Ambrosial
        Bani of the Word, I obtain the Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar.  ||
        1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who
        enshrine the Ambrosial Bani of the Word within their minds. Enshrining
        the Ambrosial Bani in their minds, they meditate on the Ambrosial
        Naam.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who continually chant the Ambrosial
        Words of Nectar see and behold this Amrit everywhere with their
        eyes. They continually chant the Ambrosial Sermon day and night;
        chanting it, they cause others to hear it.  || 2 ||   Imbued with
        the Ambrosial Love of the Lord, they lovingly focus their attention
        on Him. By Guru's Grace, they receive this Amrit. They chant
        the Ambrosial Name with their tongues day and night; their minds
        and bodies are satisfied by this Amrit.  || 3 ||   That which
        God does is beyond anyone's consciousness; no one can erase
        the Hukam of His Command. By His Command, the Ambrosial Bani of
        the Word prevails, and by His Command, we drink in the Amrit.
        || 4 ||   The actions of the Creator Lord are marvellous and
        wonderful. This mind is deluded, and goes around the wheel of
        reincarnation. Those who focus their consciousness on the Ambrosial
        Bani of the Word, hear the vibrations of the Ambrosial Word of
        the Shabad.  || </p>

      <p> 5 ||   You Yourself created the counterfeit and the genuine. You
        Yourself appraise all people. You appraise the true, and place
        them in Your Treasury; You consign the false to wander in delusion.
        || 6 ||   How can I behold You? How can I praise You? By Guru's
        Grace, I praise You through the Word of the Shabad. In Your Sweet
        Will, the Amrit is found; by Your Will, You inspire us to drink
        in this Amrit.  || 7 ||   The Shabad is Amrit; the Lord's
        Bani is Amrit. Serving the True Guru, it permeates the heart.
        O Nanak, the Ambrosial Naam is forever the Giver of peace; drinking
        in this Amrit, all hunger is satisfied.  || 8 || 15 || 16 || 
        MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The Ambrosial Nectar rains down, softly
        and gently. How rare are those Gurmukhs who find it. Those who
        drink it in are satisfied forever. Showering His Mercy upon them,
        the Lord quenches their thirst.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my
        soul is a sacrifice, to those Gurmukhs who drink in this Ambrosial
        Nectar. The tongue tastes the essence, and remains forever imbued
        with the Lord's Love, intuitively singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By Guru's Grace, intuitive
        understanding is obtained; subduing the sense of duality, they
        are in love with the One. When He bestows His Glance of Grace,
        then they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; by His Grace,
        they merge in Truth.  || 2 ||   Above all is Your Glance of Grace,
        O God. Upon some it is bestowed less, and upon others it is bestowed
        more. Without You, nothing happens at all; the Gurmukhs understand
        this.  || 3 ||   The Gurmukhs contemplate the essence of reality;
        Your Treasures are overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar. Without
        serving the True Guru, no one obtains it. It is obtained only
        by Guru's Grace.  || 4 ||   Those who serve the True Guru
        are beautiful. The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, entices
        their inner minds. Their minds and bodies are attuned to the Ambrosial
        Bani of the Word; this Ambrosial Nectar is intuitively heard.
        || 5 ||   The deluded, self-willed manmukhs are ruined through
        the love of duality. They do not chant the Naam, and they die,
        eating poison. Night and day, they continually sit in manure.
        Without selfless service, their lives are wasted away.  || 6 ||
        They alone drink in this Amrit, whom the Lord Himself inspires
        to do so. By Guru's Grace, they intuitively enshrine love
        for the Lord. The Perfect Lord is Himself perfectly pervading
        everywhere; through the Guru's Teachings, He is perceived.
        || 7 ||   He Himself is the Immaculate Lord. He who has created,
        shall Himself destroy. O Nanak, remember the Naam forever, and
        you shall merge into the True One with intuitive ease.  || 8 ||
        16 || 17 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who please You are linked
        to the Truth. They serve the True One forever, with intuitive
        ease. Through the True Word of the Shabad, they praise the True
        One, and they merge in the merging of Truth.  || 1 ||   I am a
        sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who praise the True
        One. Those who meditate on the True One are attuned to Truth;
        they are absorbed into the Truest of the True.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The True One is everywhere, wherever I look. By Guru's
        Grace, I enshrine Him in my mind. True are the bodies of those
        whose tongues are attuned to Truth. </p>

      <p> They hear the Truth, and speak it with their mouths.  || 2 ||
        Subduing their desires, they merge with the True One; they see
        in their minds that everyone comes and goes in reincarnation.
        Serving the True Guru, they become stable forever, and they obtain
        their dwelling in the home of the self.  || 3 ||   Through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is seen within one's
        own heart. Through the Shabad, I have burned my emotional attachment
        to Maya. I gaze upon the Truest of the True, and I praise Him.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I obtain the True
        One.  || 4 ||   Those who are attuned to Truth are blessed with
        the Love of the True One. Those who praise the Lord's Name
        are very fortunate. Through the Word of His Shabad, the True One
        blends with Himself, those who join the True Congregation and
        sing the Glorious Praises of the True One.  || 5 ||   We could
        read the account of the Lord, if He were in any account. He is
        Inaccessible and Incomprehensible; through the Shabad, understanding
        is obtained. Night and day, praise the True Word of the Shabad.
        There is no other way to know His Worth.  || 6 ||   People read
        and recite until they grow weary, but they do not find peace.
        Consumed by desire, they have no understanding at all. They purchase
        poison, and they are thirsty with their fascination for poison.
        Telling lies, they eat poison.  || 7 ||   By Guru's Grace,
        I know the One. Subduing my sense of duality, my mind is absorbed
        into the True One. O Nanak, the One Name is pervading deep within
        my mind; by Guru's Grace, I receive it.  || 8 || 17 || 18
        ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  In all colors and forms, You are pervading.
        People die over and over again; they are re-born, and make their
        rounds on the wheel of reincarnation. You alone are Eternal and
        Unchanging, Inaccessible and Infinite. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, understanding is imparted.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Lord's
        Name in their minds. The Lord has no form, features or color.
        Through the Guru's Teachings, He inspires us to understand
        Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One Light is all-pervading; only
        a few know this. Serving the True Guru, this is revealed. In the
        hidden and in the obvious, He is pervading all places. Our light
        merges into the Light.  || 2 ||   The world is burning in the
        fire of desire, in greed, arrogance and excessive ego. People
        die over and over again; they are re-born, and lose their honor.
        They waste away their lives in vain.  || 3 ||   Those who understand
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad are very rare. Those who subdue
        their egotism, come to know the three worlds. Then, they die,
        never to die again. They are intuitively absorbed in the True
        One.  || 4 ||   They do not focus their consciousness on Maya
        again. They remain absorbed forever in the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. They praise the True One, who is contained deep within
        all hearts. They are blessed and exalted by the Truest of the
        True.  || 5 ||   Praise the True One, who is Ever-present. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is pervading everywhere.
        By Guru's Grace, we come to behold the True One; from the
        True One, peace is obtained.  || 6 ||   The True One permeates
        and pervades the mind within. The True One is Eternal and Unchanging;
        He does not come and go in reincarnation. Those who are attached
        to the True One are immaculate and pure. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, they merge in the True One.  || 7 ||   Praise the True
        One, and no other. Serving Him, eternal peace is obtained. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam, reflect deeply on
        the Truth; they practice only Truth.  || 8 || 18 || 19 ||   MAAJH,
        THIRD MEHL:  The Word of the Shabad is Immaculate and Pure; the
        Bani of the Word is Pure. The Light which is pervading among all
        is Immaculate. So praise the Immaculate Word of the Lord's
        Bani; chanting the Immaculate Name of the Lord, all filth is washed
        away.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to
        those who enshrine the Giver of peace within their minds. Praise
        the Immaculate Lord, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        Listen to the Shabad, and quench your thirst.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   When the Immaculate Naam comes to dwell in the mind, the
        mind and body become Immaculate, and emotional attachment to Maya
        departs. Sing the Glorious Praises of the Immaculate True Lord
        forever, and the Immaculate Sound-current of the Naad shall vibrate
        within.  || 2 ||   The Immaculate Ambrosial Nectar is obtained
        from the Guru. When selfishness and conceit are eradicated from
        within, then there is no attachment to Maya. Immaculate is the
        spiritual wisdom, and utterly immaculate is the meditation, of
        those whose minds are filled with the Immaculate Bani of the Word.
        || 3 ||   One who serves the Immaculate Lord becomes immaculate.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the filth of egotism
        is washed away. The Immaculate Bani and the Unstruck Melody of
        the Sound-current vibrate, and in the True Court, honor is obtained.
        || 4 ||   Through the Immaculate Lord, all become immaculate.
        Immaculate is the mind which weaves the Word of the Lord's
        Shabad into itself. Blessed and very fortunate are those who are
        committed to the Immaculate Name; through the Immaculate Name,
        they are blessed and beautified.  || 5 ||   Immaculate is the
        one who is adorned with the Shabad. The Immaculate Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, entices the mind and body. No filth ever attaches
        itself to the True Name; one's face is made radiant by the
        True One.  || 6 ||   The mind is polluted by the love of duality.
        Filthy is that kitchen, and filthy is that dwelling; eating filth,
        the self-willed manmukhs become even more filthy. Because of their
        filth, they suffer in pain.  || 7 ||   The filthy, and the immaculate
        as well, are all subject to the Hukam of God's Command. They
        alone are immaculate, who are pleasing to the True Lord. O Nanak,
        the Naam abides deep within the minds of the Gurmukhs, who are
        cleansed of all their filth.  || 8 || 19 || 20 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD
        MEHL:  The Lord of the Universe is radiant, and radiant are His
        soul-swans. Their minds and their speech are immaculate; they
        are my hope and ideal. Their minds are radiant, and their faces
        are always beautiful; they meditate on the most radiant Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is
        a sacrifice, to those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
        of the Universe. So chant Gobind, Gobind, the Lord of the Universe,
        day and night; sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord Gobind, through
        the Word of His Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sing of the Lord
        Gobind with intuitive ease, in the Fear of the Guru; you shall
        become radiant, and the filth of egotism shall depart. Remain
        in bliss forever, and perform devotional worship, day and night.
        Hear and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord Gobind.  || 2 ||
        Channel your dancing mind in devotional worship, and through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, merge your mind with the Supreme
        Mind. Let your true and perfect tune be the subjugation of your
        love of Maya, and let yourself dance to the Shabad.  || 3 || 
        People shout out loud and move their bodies, but if they are
        emotionally attached to Maya, then the Messenger of Death shall
        hunt them down. </p>

      <p> The love of Maya makes this mind dance, and the deceit within
        makes people suffer in pain.  || 4 ||   When the Lord inspires
        one to become Gurmukh, and perform devotional worship, then his
        body and mind are attuned to His Love with intuitive ease. The
        Word of His Bani vibrates, and the Word of His Shabad resounds,
        for the Gurmukh whose devotional worship is accepted.  || 5 ||
        One may beat upon and play all sorts of instruments, but no
        one will listen, and no one will enshrine it in the mind. For
        the sake of Maya, they set the stage and dance, but they are in
        love with duality, and they obtain only sorrow.  || 6 ||   Those
        whose inner beings are attached to the Lord's Love are liberated.
        They control their sexual desires, and their lifestyle is the
        self-discipline of Truth. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, they meditate forever on the Lord. This devotional worship
        is pleasing to the Lord.  || 7 ||   To live as Gurmukh is devotional
        worship, throughout the four ages. This devotional worship is
        not obtained by any other means. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, is obtained only through devotion to the Guru. So focus
        your consciousness on the Guru's Feet.  || 8 || 20 || 21
        ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  Serve the True One, and praise the True
        One. With the True Name, pain shall never afflict you. Those who
        serve the Giver of peace find peace. They enshrine the Guru's
        Teachings within their minds.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my
        soul is a sacrifice, to those who intuitively enter into the peace
        of Samaadhi. Those who serve the Lord are always beautiful. The
        glory of their intuitive awareness is beautiful.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   All call themselves Your devotees, but they alone are Your
        devotees, who are pleasing to Your mind. Through the True Word
        of Your Bani, they praise You; attuned to Your Love, they worship
        You with devotion.  || 2 ||   All are Yours, O Dear True Lord.
        Meeting the Gurmukh, this cycle of reincarnation comes to an end.
        When it pleases Your Will, then we merge in the Name. You Yourself
        inspire us to chant the Name.  || 3 ||   Through the Guru's
        Teachings, I enshrine the Lord within my mind. Pleasure and pain,
        and all emotional attachments are gone. I am lovingly centered
        on the One Lord forever. I enshrine the Lord's Name within
        my mind.  || 4 ||   Your devotees are attuned to Your Love; they
        are always joyful. The nine treasures of the Naam come to dwell
        within their minds. By perfect destiny, they find the True Guru,
        and through the Word of the Shabad, they are united in the Lord's
        Union.  || 5 ||   You are Merciful, and always the Giver of peace.
        You Yourself unite us; You are known only to the Gurmukhs. You
        Yourself bestow the glorious greatness of the Naam; attuned to
        the Naam, we find peace.  || 6 ||   Forever and ever, O True Lord,
        I praise You. As Gurmukh, I know no other at all. My mind remains
        immersed in the One Lord; my mind surrenders to Him, and in my
        mind I meet Him.  || 7 ||   One who becomes Gurmukh, praises the
        Lord. Our True Lord and Master is Carefree. O Nanak, the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the mind; through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, we merge with the Lord.  || 8
        || 21 || 22 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  Your devotees look beautiful
        in the True Court. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        they are adorned with the Naam. They are forever in bliss, day
        and night; chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, they merge
        with the Lord of Glory. </p>

      <p> || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who
        hear and enshrine the Naam within their minds. The Dear Lord,
        the True One, the Highest of the High, subdues their ego and blends
        them with Himself.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   True is the Dear Lord,
        and True is His Name. By Guru's Grace, some merge with Him.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, those who merge with
        the Lord shall not be separated from Him again. They merge with
        intuitive ease into the True Lord.  || 2 ||   There is nothing
        beyond You; You are the One who does, sees, and knows. The Creator
        Himself acts, and inspires others to act. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, He blends us into Himself.  || 3 ||   The virtuous
        soul-bride finds the Lord; she decorates herself with the Love
        and the Fear of God. She who serves the True Guru is forever a
        happy soul-bride. She is absorbed in the true teachings.  || 4
        ||   Those who forget the Word of the Shabad have no home and
        no place of rest. They are deluded by doubt, like a crow in a
        deserted house. They forfeit both this world and the next, and
        they pass their lives suffering in pain and misery.  || 5 || 
        Writing on and on endlessly, they run out of paper and ink. Through
        the love with duality, no one has found peace. They write falsehood,
        and they practice falsehood; they are burnt to ashes by focusing
        their consciousness on falsehood.  || 6 ||   The Gurmukhs write
        and reflect on Truth, and only Truth. The true ones find the gate
        of salvation. True is their paper, pen and ink; writing Truth,
        they are absorbed in the True One.  || 7 ||   My God sits deep
        within the self; He watches over us. Those who meet the Lord,
        by Guru's Grace, are acceptable. O Nanak, glorious greatness
        is received through the Naam, which is obtained through the Perfect
        Guru.  || 8 || 22 || 23 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The Divine Light
        of the Supreme Soul shines forth from the Guru. The filth stuck
        to the ego is removed through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        One who is imbued with devotional worship to the Lord night and
        day becomes pure. Worshipping the Lord, He is obtained.  || 1
        ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who themselves
        worship the Lord, and inspire others to worship Him as well. I
        humbly bow to those devotees who chant the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord, night and day.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Creator Lord
        Himself is the Doer of deeds. As He pleases, He applies us to
        our tasks. Through perfect destiny, we serve the Guru; serving
        the Guru, peace is found.  || 2 ||   Those who die, and remain
        dead while yet alive, obtain it. By Guru's Grace, they enshrine
        the Lord within their minds. Enshrining the Lord within their
        minds, they are liberated forever. With intuitive ease, they merge
        into the Lord.  || 3 ||   They perform all sorts of rituals, but
        they do not obtain liberation through them. They wander around
        the countryside, and in love with duality, they are ruined. The
        deceitful lose their lives in vain; without the Word of the Shabad,
        they obtain only misery.  || 4 ||   Those who restrain their wandering
        mind, keeping it steady and stable, obtain the supreme status,
        by Guru's Grace. The True Guru Himself unites us in Union
        with the Lord. </p>

      <p> Meeting the Beloved, peace is obtained.  || 5 ||   Some are stuck
        in falsehood, and false are the rewards they receive. In love
        with duality, they waste away their lives in vain. They drown
        themselves, and drown their entire family; speaking lies, they
        eat poison.  || 6 ||   How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, look
        within their bodies, into their minds. Through loving devotion,
        their ego evaporates. The Siddhas, the seekers and the silent
        sages continually, lovingly focus their consciousness, but they
        have not seen the mind within the body.  || 7 ||   The Creator
        Himself inspires us to work; what can anyone else do? What can
        be done by our doing? O Nanak, the Lord bestows His Name; we receive
        it, and enshrine it within the mind.  || 8 || 23 || 24 ||   MAAJH,
        THIRD MEHL:  Within this cave, there is an inexhaustible treasure.
        Within this cave, the Invisible and Infinite Lord abides. He Himself
        is hidden, and He Himself is revealed; through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, selfishness and conceit are eliminated.  ||
        1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who
        enshrine the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, within their
        minds. The taste of the Ambrosial Naam is very sweet! Through
        the Guru's Teachings, drink in this Ambrosial Nectar.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Subduing egotism, the rigid doors are opened.
        The Priceless Naam is obtained by Guru's Grace. Without the
        Shabad, the Naam is not obtained. By Guru's Grace, it is
        implanted within the mind.  || 2 ||   The Guru has applied the
        true ointment of spiritual wisdom to my eyes. Deep within, the
        Divine Light has dawned, and the darkness of ignorance has been
        dispelled. My light has merged into the Light; my mind has surrendered,
        and I am blessed with Glory in the Court of the Lord.  || 3 ||
        Those who look outside the body, searching for the Lord, shall
        not receive the Naam; they shall instead be forced to suffer the
        terrible pains of slavery. The blind, self-willed manmukhs do
        not understand; but when they return once again to their own home,
        then, as Gurmukh, they find the genuine article.  || 4 ||   By
        Guru's Grace, the True Lord is found. Within your mind and
        body, see the Lord, and the filth of egotism shall depart. Sitting
        in that place, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord forever,
        and be absorbed in the True Word of the Shabad.  || 5 ||   Those
        who close off the nine gates, and restrain the wandering mind,
        come to dwell in the Home of the Tenth Gate. There, the Unstruck
        Melody of the Shabad vibrates day and night. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, the Shabad is heard.  || 6 ||   Without the Shabad,
        there is only darkness within. The genuine article is not found,
        and the cycle of reincarnation does not end. The key is in the
        hands of the True Guru; no one else can open this door. By perfect
        destiny, He is met.  || 7 ||   You are the hidden and the revealed
        in all places. Receiving Guru's Grace, this understanding
        is obtained. O Nanak, praise the Naam forever; as Gurmukh, enshrine
        it within the mind.  || 8 || 24 || 25 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:
        The Gurmukhs meet the Lord, and inspire others to meet Him as
        well. Death does not see them, and pain does not afflict them.
        Subduing egotism, they break all their bonds; as Gurmukh, they
        are adorned with the Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        my soul is a sacrifice, to those who look beautiful in the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har. </p>

        on the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Gurmukhs are celebrated
        in life and death. Their lives are not wasted; they realize the
        Word of the Shabad. The Gurmukhs do not die; they are not consumed
        by death. The Gurmukhs are absorbed in the True Lord.  || 2 ||
        The Gurmukhs are honored in the Court of the Lord. The Gurmukhs
        eradicate selfishness and conceit from within. They save themselves,
        and save all their families and ancestors as well. The Gurmukhs
        redeem their lives.  || 3 ||   The Gurmukhs never suffer bodily
        pain. The Gurmukhs have the pain of egotism taken away. The minds
        of the Gurmukhs are immaculate and pure; no filth ever sticks
        to them again. The Gurmukhs merge in celestial peace.  || 4 ||
        The Gurmukhs obtain the Greatness of the Naam. The Gurmukhs
        sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and obtain honor. They
        remain in bliss forever, day and night. The Gurmukhs practice
        the Word of the Shabad.  || 5 ||   The Gurmukhs are attuned to
        the Shabad, night and day. The Gurmukhs are known throughout the
        four ages. The Gurmukhs always sing the Glorious Praises of the
        Immaculate Lord. Through the Shabad, they practice devotional
        worship.  || 6 ||   Without the Guru, there is only pitch-black
        darkness. Seized by the Messenger of Death, people cry out and
        scream. Night and day, they are diseased, like maggots in manure,
        and in manure they endure agony.  || 7 ||   The Gurmukhs know
        that the Lord alone acts, and causes others to act. In the hearts
        of the Gurmukhs, the Lord Himself comes to dwell. O Nanak, through
        the Naam, greatness is obtained. It is received from the Perfect
        Guru.  || 8 || 25 || 26 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The One Light
        is the light of all bodies. The Perfect True Guru reveals it through
        the Word of the Shabad. He Himself instills the sense of separation
        within our hearts; He Himself created the Creation.  || 1 || 
        I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who sing the
        Glorious Praises of the True Lord. Without the Guru, no one obtains
        intuitive wisdom; the Gurmukh is absorbed in intuitive peace.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You Yourself are Beautiful, and You Yourself
        entice the world. You Yourself, by Your Kind Mercy, weave the
        thread of the world. You Yourself bestow pain and pleasure, O
        Creator. The Lord reveals Himself to the Gurmukh.  || 2 ||  The
        Creator Himself acts, and causes others to act. Through Him, the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad is enshrined within the mind. The
        Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani emanates from the Word
        of the Shabad. The Gurmukh speaks it and hears it.  || 3 ||  
        He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer. One
        who breaks out of bondage is liberated forever. The True Lord
        is liberated forever. The Unseen Lord causes Himself to be seen.
        || 4 ||   He Himself is Maya, and He Himself is the Illusion.
        He Himself has generated emotional attachment throughout the entire
        universe. He Himself is the Giver of Virtue; He Himself sings
        the Lord's Glorious Praises. He chants them and causes them
        to be heard.  || 5 ||   He Himself acts, and causes others to
        act. He Himself establishes and disestablishes. Without You, nothing
        can be done. You Yourself have engaged all in their tasks.  ||
        6 ||   He Himself kills, and He Himself revives. He Himself unites
        us, and unites us in Union with Himself. Through selfless service,
        eternal peace is obtained. </p>

        || 27 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  My God is pervading and permeating

        home of my own heart. I serve Him constantly, and I meditate on
        Him single-mindedly. As Gurmukh, I am absorbed in the True One.
        || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those
        who enshrine the Lord, the Life of the World, within their minds.
        Through the Guru's Teachings, I merge with intuitive ease
        into the Lord, the Life of the World, the Fearless One, the Great
        Giver.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Within the home of the self is the
        earth, its support and the nether regions of the underworld. Within
        the home of the self is the Eternally Young Beloved. The Giver
        of peace is eternally blissful. Through the Guru's Teachings,
        we are absorbed in intuitive peace.  || 2 ||   When the body is
        filled with ego and selfishness, the cycle of birth and death
        does not end. One who becomes Gurmukh subdues egotism, and meditates
        on the Truest of the True.  || 3 ||   Within this body are the
        two brothers, sin and virtue. When the two joined together, the
        Universe was produced. Subduing both, and entering into the Home
        of the One, through the Guru's Teachings, we are absorbed
        in intuitive peace.  || 4 ||   Within the home of the self is
        the darkness of the love of duality. When the Divine Light dawns,
        ego and selfishness are dispelled. The Giver of peace is revealed
        through the Shabad, meditating upon the Naam, night and day. 
        || 5 ||   Deep within the self is the Light of God; It radiates
        throughout the expanse of His creation. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled. The
        heart-lotus blossoms forth, and eternal peace is obtained, as
        one's light merges into the Light.  || 6 ||   Within the
        mansion is the treasure house, overflowing with jewels. The Gurmukh
        obtains the Infinite Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Gurmukh,
        the trader, always purchases the merchandise of the Naam, and
        always reaps profits.  || 7 ||   The Lord Himself keeps this merchandise
        in stock, and He Himself distributes it. Rare is that Gurmukh
        who trades in this. O Nanak, those upon whom the Lord casts His
        Glance of Grace, obtain it. Through His Mercy, it is enshrined
        in the mind.  || 8 || 27 || 28 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The Lord
        Himself leads us to merge with Him and serve Him. Through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, the love of duality is eradicated.
        The Immaculate Lord is the Bestower of eternal virtue. The Lord
        Himself leads us to merge in His Virtuous Goodness.  || 1 || 
        I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine
        the Truest of the True within their hearts. The True Name is eternally
        pure and immaculate. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        it is enshrined within the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru
        Himself is the Giver, the Architect of Destiny. The Gurmukh, the
        humble servant who serves the Lord, comes to know Him. Those humble
        beings look beautiful forever in the Ambrosial Naam. Through the
        Guru's Teachings, they receive the sublime essence of the
        Lord.  || 2 ||   Within the cave of this body, there is one beautiful
        place. Through the Perfect Guru, ego and doubt are dispelled.
        Night and day, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; imbued with
        the Lord's Love, by Guru's Grace, you shall find Him.
