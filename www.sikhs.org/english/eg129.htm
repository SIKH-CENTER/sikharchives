      <p> He forgives, once and for all, and never asks for one's
        account again.  || 3 ||   By pre-ordained destiny, I have searched
        and found God. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the
        Lord of the World abides. Meeting with the Guru, I have come to
        Your Door. O Lord, please bless servant Nanak with the Blessed
        Vision of Your Darshan.  || 4 || 1 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Serving God, His humble servant is glorified. Unfulfilled sexual
        desire, unresolved anger and unsatisfied greed are eradicated.
        Your Name is the treasure of Your humble servant. Singing His
        Praises, I am in love with the Blessed Vision of God's
        Darshan.  || 1 ||   You are known, O God, by Your devotees. Breaking
        their bonds, You emancipate them.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those
        humble beings who are imbued with God's Love find peace
        in God's Congregation. They alone understand this, to whom
        this subtle essence comes. Beholding it, and gazing upon it, in
        their minds they are wonderstruck.  || 2 ||   They are at peace,
        the most exalted of all, within whose hearts God dwells. They
        are stable and unchanging; they do not come and go in reincarnation.
        Night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord God.
        || 3 ||   All bow down in humble respect to those whose minds
        are filled with the Formless Lord. Show mercy unto me, O my Divine
        Lord and Master. May Nanak be saved, by serving these humble beings.
        || 4 || 2 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Singing His Glorious
        Praises, the mind is in ecstasy. Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate
        in remembrance on God. Remembering Him in meditation, the residues
        of sin go away. I fall at the Feet of that Guru.  || 1 ||   O
        beloved Saints, please bless me with wisdom; let me meditate on
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and be emancipated.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   The Guru has shown me the straight path; I have abandoned
        everything else. I am enraptured with the Name of the Lord. I
        am forever a sacrifice to that Guru; I meditate in remembrance
        on the Lord, through the Guru.  || 2 ||   The Guru carries those
        mortal beings across, and saves them from drowning. By His Grace,
        they are not enticed by Maya; in this world and the next, they
        are embellished and exalted by the Guru. I am forever a sacrifice
        to that Guru.  || 3 ||   From the most ignorant, I have been made
        spiritually wise, through the Unspoken Speech of the Perfect Guru.
        The Divine Guru, O Nanak, is the Supreme Lord God. By great good
        fortune, I serve the Lord.  || 4 || 3 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Eradicating all my pains, He has blessed me with peace,
        and inspired me to chant His Name. In His Mercy, He has enjoined
        me to His service, and has purged me of all my sins.  || 1 ||
        I am only a child; I seek the Sanctuary of God the Merciful.
        Erasing my demerits and faults, God has made me His Own. My Guru,
        the Lord of the World, protects me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My sicknesses
        and sins were erased in an instant, when the Lord of the World
        became merciful. With each and very breath, I worship and adore
        the Supreme Lord God; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru.  || 2
        ||   My Lord and Master is Inaccessible, Unfathomable and Infinite.
        His limits cannot be found. <br>

      <p> We earn the profit, and become wealthy, meditating on our God.
        || 3 ||   Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on the Supreme
        Lord God; I sing His Glorious Praises forever and ever. Says Nanak,
        my desires have been fulfilled; I have found my Guru, the Supreme
        Lord God.  || 4 || 4 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating
        in rememberance on the Naam, all the residues of my sinful mistakes
        have been erased. The Guru has blessed me with the Capital of
        the True Name. God's servants are embellished and exalted
        in His Court; serving Him, they look beauteous forever.  || 1
        ||   Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my Siblings of Destiny.
        All sickness and sin shall be erased; your mind shall be rid of
        the darkness of ignorance.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru has
        saved me from death and rebirth, O friend; I am in love with the
        Name of the Lord. The suffering of millions of incarnations is
        gone; whatever pleases Him is good.  || 2 ||   I am forever a
        sacrifice to the Guru; by His Grace, I meditate on the Lord's
        Name. By great good fortune, such a Guru is found; meeting Him,
        one is lovingly attuned to the Lord.  || 3 ||   Please be merciful,
        O Supreme Lord God, O Lord and Master, Inner-knower, Searcher
        of Hearts. Twenty-four hours a day, I am lovingly attuned to You.
        Servant Nanak has come to the Sanctuary of God.  || 4 || 5 ||
        PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  In His Mercy, God has made me His
        Own. He has blessed me with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Twenty-four
        hours a day, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
        Fear is dispelled, and all anxiety has been alleviated.  || 1
        ||   I have been saved, touching the Feet of the True Guru. Whatever
        the Guru says is good and sweet to me. I have renounced the intellectual
        wisdom of my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That Lord God abides
        within my mind and body. There are no conflicts, pains or obstacles.
        Forever and ever, God is with my soul. Filth and pollution are
        washed away by the Love of the Name.  || 2 ||   I am in love with
        the Lotus Feet of the Lord; I am no longer consumed by sexual
        desire, anger and egotism. Now, I know the way to meet God. Through
        loving devotional worship, my mind is pleased and appeased with
        the Lord.  || 3 ||   Listen, O friends, Saints, my exalted companions.
        The Jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is unfathomable and
        immeasurable. Forever and ever, sing the Glories of God, the Treasure
        of Virtue. Says Nanak, by great good fortune, He is found.  ||
        4 || 6 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  They are wealthy, and they
        are the true merchants, who have the credit of the Naam in the
        Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||   So chant the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, in your mind, my friends. The Perfect Guru is found by great
        good fortune, and then one's lifestyle becomes perfect
        and immaculate.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They earn the profit, and
        the congratulations pour in; by the Grace of the Saints, they
        sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 2 ||   Their lives
        are fruitful and prosperous, and their birth is approved; by Guru's
        Grace, they enjoy the Love of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Sexuality,
        anger and egotism are wiped away; O Nanak, as Gurmukh, they are
        carried across to the other shore.  || 4 || 7 ||   PRABHAATEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Guru is Perfect, and Perfect is His Power. <br>

      <p> The Word of the Guru's Shabad is unchanging, forever and
        ever. All pains and afflictions run away from those, whose minds
        are filled with the Word of the Guru's Bani.  || 1 || 
        Imbued with the Lord's Love, they sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord. They are liberated, bathing in the dust of the feet
        of the Holy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By Guru's Grace, they
        are carried across to the other shore; they are rid of fear, doubt
        and corruption. The Guru's Feet abide deep within their
        minds and bodies. The Holy are fearless; they take to the Sanctuary
        of the Lord.  || 2 ||   They are blessed with abundant bliss,
        happiness, pleasure and peace. Enemies and pains do not even approach
        them. The Perfect Guru makes them His Own, and protects them.
        Chanting the Lord's Name, they are rid of all the residues
        of their sinful mistakes.  || 3 ||   The Saints, spiritual companions
        and Sikhs are exalted and uplifted. The Perfect Guru leads them
        to meet God. The painful noose of death and rebirth is snapped.
        Says Nanak, the Guru covers their faults.  || 4 || 8 ||   PRABHAATEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Perfect True Guru has bestowed the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord. I am blessed with bliss and happiness, emancipation
        and eternal peace. All my affairs have been resolved.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The Lotus Feet of the Guru abide within my mind.
        I am rid of pain, suffering, doubt and fraud.  || 1 ||   Rise
        early, and sing the Glorious Word of God's Bani. Twenty-four
        hours a day, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, O mortal.  ||
        2 ||   Inwardly and outwardly, God is everywhere. Wherever I go,
        He is always with me, my Helper and Support.  || 3 ||   With my
        palms pressed together, I offer this prayer. O Nanak, I meditate
        forever on the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue.  || 4 || 9 ||   PRABHAATEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Supreme Lord God is All-wise and All-knowing.
        The Perfect Guru is found by great good fortune. I am a sacrifice
        to the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        sinful residues of past mistakes are cut away, through the Word
        of the Shabad, and I have found contentment. I have become worthy
        of worshipping the Naam in adoration. In the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, I have been enlightened. The Lord's
        Lotus Feet abide within my mind.  || 1 ||   The One who made us,
        protects and preserves us. God is Perfect, the Master of the masterless.
        Those, upon whom He showers His Mercy - they have perfect
        karma and conduct.  || 2 ||   They sing the Glories of God, continually,
        continuously, forever fresh and new. They do not wander in the
        8.4 million incarnations. Here and hereafter, they worship the
        Lord's Feet. Their faces are radiant, and they are honored
        in the Court of the Lord.  || 3 ||   That person, upon whose forehead
        the Guru places His Hand - out of millions, how rare is
        that slave. He sees God pervading and permeating the water, the
        land and the sky. Nanak is saved by the dust of the feet of such
        a humble being.  || 4 || 10 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I am
        a sacrifice to my Perfect Guru. By His Grace, I chant and meditate
        on the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Listening to the
        Ambrosial Word of His Bani, I am exalted and enraptured. My corrupt
        and poisonous entanglements are gone.  || 1 ||   I am in love
        with the True Word of His Shabad. The Lord God has come into my
        consciousness.  || 2 ||   Chanting the Naam, I am enlightened. <br>

        Chanting and meditating on the Lord, Nanak is exalted and enraptured.
        || 4 || 11 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Chanting Guru, Guru,
        I have found eternal peace. God, Merciful to the meek, has become
        kind and compassionate; He has inspired me to chant His Name.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Joining the Society of the Saints, I am
        illumined and enlightened. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, my hopes have been fulfilled.  || 1 ||   I am blessed with
        total salvation, and my mind is filled with peace. I sing the

      <p> <font color="#000000">The insanity of duality has driven the mind
        insane. In false greed, life is wasting away. Duality clings to
        the mind; it cannot be restrained. The True Guru saves us, implanting
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord within.  || 1 ||   Without subduing
        the mind, Maya cannot be subdued. The One who created this, He
        alone understands. Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, one is
        carried across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Gathering the wealth of Maya, kings become proud and arrogant.
        But this Maya that they love so much shall not go along with them
        in the end. There are so many colors and flavors of attachment
        to Maya. Except for the Name, no one has any friend or companion.
        || 2 ||   According to one's own mind, one sees the minds
        of others. According to one's desires, one's condition
        is determined. According to one's actions, one is focused
        and tuned in. Seeking the advice of the True Guru, one finds the
        home of peace and poise.  || 3 ||   In music and song, the mind
        is caught by the love of duality. Filled with deception deep within,
        one suffers in terrible pain. Meeting with the True Guru, one
        is blessed with clear understanding, and remains lovingly attuned
        to the True Name.  || 4 ||   Through the True Word of the Shabad,
        one practices Truth. He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        through the True Word of His Bani. He dwells in the home of his
        own heart deep within, and obtains the immortal status. Then,
        he is blessed with honor in the Court of the True Lord.  || 5
        ||   Without serving the Guru, there is no devotional worship,
        even though one may make all sorts of efforts. If one eradicates
        egotism and selfishness through the Shabad, the Immaculate Naam
        comes to abide in the mind.  ||  || 6 ||   In this world, the
        practice of the Shabad is the most excellent occupation. Without
        the Shabad, everything else is the darkness of emotional attachment.
        Through the Shabad, the Naam is enshrined within the heart. Through
        the Shabad, one obtains clear understanding and the door of salvation.
        || 7 ||   There is no other Creator except the All-seeing Lord
        God. The True Lord Himself is Infinite and Incomparably Beautiful.
        Through the Lord's Name, one obtains the most sublime and
        exalted state. O Nanak, how rare are those humble beings, who
        seek and find the Lord.  || 8 || 1 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:
        Emotional attachment to Maya is spread out all over the world.
        Seeing a beautiful woman, the man is overcome with sexual desire.
        His love for his children and gold steadily increases. He sees
        everything as his own, but he does not own the One Lord.  || 1
        ||   I meditate as I chant on such a mala, that I rise above pleasure
        and pain; I attain the most wondrous devotional worship of the
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Treasure of Virtue, Your limits
        cannot be found. Through the True Word of the Shabad, I am absorbed
        into You. You Yourself created the comings and goings of reincarnation.
        They alone are devotees, who focus their consciousness on You.
        || 2 ||   Spiritual wisdom and meditation on the Lord, the Lord
        of Nirvaanaa - without meeting the True Guru, no one knows
        this. The Lord's Light fills the sacred pools of all beings.
        I am a sacrifice to the Embodiment of Bliss.  || 3 ||   Through
        the Guru's Teachings, one achieves loving devotional worship.
        The Shabad burns away egotism from within. <br>

      <p> The wandering mind is restrained and held in its place. The True
        Name is enshrined in the mind.  || 4 ||   The exciting and intoxicating
        worldly plays come to an end, for those who accept the Guru's
        Teachings, and become lovingly attuned to the One Lord. Seeing
        this, the fire in the water is extinguished. They alone realize
        this, who are blessed by great good fortune.  || 5 ||   Serving
        the True Guru, doubt is dispelled. Those who are lovingly attuned
        to the True Lord remain awake and aware night and day. They know
        the One Lord, and no other. Serving the Giver of peace, they become
        immaculate.  || 6 ||   Selfless service and intuitive awareness
        come by reflecting upon the Word of the Shabad. Chanting, intensive
        meditation and austere self-discipline come by subduing the ego.
        One becomes Jivan-mukta - liberated while yet alive, by
        listening to the Shabad. Living a truthful way of life, one finds
        true peace.  || 7 ||   The Giver of peace is the Eradicator of
        pain. I cannot conceive of serving any other. I place my body,
        mind and wealth in offering before Him. Says Nanak, I have tasted
        the supreme, sublime Essence of the Lord.  || 8 || 2 ||   PRABHAATEE,
        FIRST MEHL:  You may perform exercises of inner purification,
        and fire up the furnace of the Kundalini, inhaling and exhaling
        and holding the breath. Without the True Guru, you will not understand;
        deluded by doubt, you shall drown and die. The spiritually blind
        are filled with filth and pollution; they may wash, but the filth
        within shall never depart. Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        all their actions are useless, like the magician who deceives
        through illuions.  || 1 ||   The merits of the six religious rituals
        are obtained through the Immaculate Naam. You, O Lord, are the
        Ocean of virtue; I am so unworthy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Running
        around chasing the entanglements of Maya is an evil-minded act
        of corruption. The fool makes a show of his self-conceit; he does
        not know how to behave. The self-willed manmukh is enticed by
        his desires for Maya; his words are useless and empty. The ritual
        cleansings of the sinner are fradulent; his rituals and decorations
        are useless and empty.  || 2 ||   False is the wisdom of the mind;
        its actions inspire useless disputes. The false are filled with
        egotism; they do not obtain the sublime taste of their Lord and
        Master. Without the Name, whatever else they do is tasteless and
        insipid. Associating with their enemies, they are plundered and
        ruined. Their speech is poison, and their lives are useless. 
        || 3 ||   Do not be deluded by doubt; do not invite your own death.
        Serve the True Guru, and you shall be at peace forever. Without
        the True Guru, no one is liberated. They come and go in reincarnation;
        they die, only to be reborn and die again.  || 4 ||   This body
        wanders, caught in the three dispositions. It is afflicted by
        sorrow and suffering. So serve the One who has no mother or father.
        Desire and selfishness shall depart from within.  || 5 ||   Wherever
        I look, I see Him. Without meeting the True Guru, no one is liberated.
        Enshrine the True One in your heart; this is the most excellent
        action. All other hypocritical actions and devotions bring only
        ruin.  || 6 ||   When one is rid of duality, then he realizes
        the Word of the Shabad. Inside and out, he knows the One Lord.
        This is the most Excellent Wisdom of the Shabad. Ashes fall on
        the heads of those who are in duality.  || 7 ||   To praise the
        Lord through the Guru's Teachings is the most excellent
        action. In the Society of the Saints, contemplate the Glories
        of God and His spiritual wisdom. Whoever subdues his mind, knows
        the state of being dead while yet alive. O Nanak, by His Grace,
        the Gracious Lord is realized.  || 8 || 3 || <br>

      <p> PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL,  DAKHNEE:  Ahalyaa was the wife of Gautam
        the seer. Seeing her, Indra was enticed. When he received a thousand
        marks of disgrace on his body, then he felt regret in his mind.
        || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, no one knowingly makes mistakes.
        He alone is mistaken, whom the Lord Himself makes so. He alone
        understands, whom the Lord causes to understand.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Harichand, the king and ruler of his land, did not appreciate
        the value of his pre-ordained destiny. If he had known that it
        was a mistake, he would not have made such a show of giving in
        charity, and he would not have been sold in the market.  || 2
        ||   The Lord took the form of a dwarf, and asked for some land.
        If Bal the king has recognized Him, he would not have been deceived,
        and sent to the underworld.  || 3 ||   Vyaas taught and warned
        the king Janmayjaa not to do three things. But he performed the
        sacred feast and killed eighteen Brahmins; the record of one's
        past deeds cannot be erased.  || 4 ||   I do not try to calculate
        the account; I accept the Hukam of God's Command. I speak
        with intuitive love and respect. No matter what happens, I will
        praise the Lord. It is all Your Glorious Greatness, O Lord.  ||
        5 ||   The Gurmukh remains detached; filth never attaches itself
        to him. He remains forever in God's Sanctuary. The foolish
        self-willed manmukh does not think of the future; he is overtaken
        by pain, and then he regrets.  || 6 ||   The Creator who created
        this creation acts, and causes all to act. O Lord, egotistical
        pride does not depart from the soul. Falling into egotistical
        pride, one is ruined.  || 7 ||   Everyone makes mistakes; only
        the Creator does not make mistakes. O Nanak, salvation comes through
        the True Name. By Guru's Grace, one is released.  || 8
        || 4 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  To chant and listen to the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my Support. Worthless entanglements
        are ended and gone. The self-willed manmukh, caught in duality,
        loses his honor. Except for the Name, I have no other at all.
        || 1 ||   Listen, O blind, foolish, idiotic mind. Aren't
        you ashamed of your comings and goings in reincarnation? Without
        the Guru, you shall drown, over and over again.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   This mind is ruined by its attachment to Maya. The Command
        of the Primal Lord is pre-ordained. Before whom should I cry?
        Only a few, as Gurmukh, understand this. Without the Naam, no
        one is liberated.  || 2 ||   People wander lost, staggering and
        stumbling through 8.4 million incarnations. Without knowing the
        Guru, they cannot escape the noose of Death. This mind, from one
        moment to the next, goes from the heavens to the underworld. The
        Gurmukh contemplates the Naam, and is released.  || 3 ||   When
        God sends His Summons, there is no time to delay. When one dies
        in the Word of the Shabad, he lives in peace. Without the Guru,
        no one understands. The Lord Himself acts, and inspires all to
        act.  || 4 ||   Inner conflict comes to an end, singing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord. Through the Perfect True Guru, one is intuitively
        absorbed into the Lord. This wobbling, unsteady mind is stabilized,
        and one lives the lifestyle of true actions.  || 5 ||   If someone
        is false within his own self, then how can he be pure? How rare
        are those who wash with the Shabad. How rare are those who, as
        Gurmukh, live the Truth. Their comings and goings in reincarnation
        are over and done. <br>

      <p> || 6 ||   Those who eat and drink the Fear of God, find the most
        excellent peace. Associating with the humble servants of the Lord,
        they are carried across. They speak the Truth, and lovingly inspire
        others to speak it as well. The Word of the Guru's Shabad
        is the most excellent occupation.  || 7 ||   Those who take the
        Lord's Praises as their karma and Dharma, their honor and
        worship service - their sexual desire and anger are burnt
        off in the fire. They taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and
        their minds are drenched with it. Prays Nanak, there is no other
        at all.  || 8 || 5 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Chant the Lord's
        Name, and worship Him deep within your being. Contemplate the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, and no other.  || 1 ||   The
        One is pervading all places. I do not see any other; unto whom
        should I offer worship?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I place my mind
        and body in offering before You; I dedicate my soul to You. As
        it pleases You, You save me, Lord; this is my prayer.  || 2 ||
        True is that tongue which is delighted by the sublime essence
        of the Lord. Following the Guru's Teachings, one is saved
        in the Sanctuary of God.  || 3 ||   My God created religious rituals.
        He placed the glory of the Naam above these rituals.  || 4 ||
        The four great blessings are under the control of the True Guru.
        When the first three are put aside, one is blessed with the fourth.
        || 5 ||   Those whom the True Guru blesses with liberation and
        meditation realize the Lord's State, and become sublime.
        || 6 ||   Their minds and bodies are cooled and soothed; the
        Guru imparts this understanding. Who can estimate the value of
        those whom God has exalted?  || 7 ||   Says Nanak, the Guru has
        imparted this understanding; without the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, no one is emancipated.  || 8 || 6 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  Some are forgiven by the Primal Lord God; the Perfect Guru
        makes the true making. Those who are attuned to the Love of the
        Lord are imbued with Truth forever; their pains are dispelled,
        and they obtain honor.  || 1 ||   False are the clever tricks
        of the evil-minded. They shall disappear in no time at all.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Pain and suffering afflict the self-willed manmukh.
        The pains of the self-willed manmukh shall never depart. The Gurmukh
        recognizes the Giver of pleasure and pain. He merges in His Sanctuary.
        || 2 ||   The self-willed manmukhs do not know loving devotional
        worship; they are insane, rotting away in their egotism. This
        mind flies in an instant from the heavens to the underworld, as
        long as it does not know the Word of the Shabad.  || 3 ||   The
        world has become hungry and thirsty; without the True Guru, it
        is not satisfied. Merging intuitively in the Celestial Lord, peace
        is obtained, and one goes to the Lord's Court wearing robes
        of honor.  || 4 ||   The Lord in His Court is Himself the Knower
        and Seer; the Word of the Guru's Bani is Immaculate. He
        Himself is the Awareness of Truth; He Himself understands the
        state of nirvaanaa.  || 5 ||   He made the waves of water, the
        fire and the air, and then joined the three together to form the
        world. He blessed these elements with such power, that they remain
        subject to His Command.  || 6 ||   How rare are those humble beings
        in this world, whom the Lord tests and places in His Treasury.
        They rise above social status and color, and rid themselves of
        possessiveness and greed.  || 7 ||   Attuned to the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, they are like immaculate sacred shrines; they
        are rid of the pain and pollution of egotism. <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">By Guru's Grace, see that the Temple
        of the Lord is within you. The Temple of the Lord is found through
        the Word of the Shabad; contemplate the Lord's Name.  ||
        1 ||   O my mind, be joyfully attuned to the Shabad. True is devotional
        worship, and True is the Temple of the Lord; True is His Manifest
        Glory.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This body is the Temple of the Lord,
        in which the jewel of spiritual wisdom is revealed. The self-willed
        manmukhs do not know anything at all; they do not believe that
        the Lord's Temple is within.  || 2 ||   The Dear Lord created
        the Temple of the Lord; He adorns it by His Will. All act according
        to their pre-ordained destiny; no one can erase it.  || 3 || 
        Contemplating the Shabad, peace is obtained, loving the True
        Name. The Temple of the Lord is embellished with the Shabad; it
        is an Infinite Fortress of God.  || 4 ||   This world is the Temple
        of the Lord; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. The
        blind and foolish self-willed manmukhs worship in the love of
        duality.  || 5 ||   One's body and social status do not
        go along to that place, where all are called to account. Those
        who are attuned to Truth are saved; those in the love of duality
        are miserable.  || 6 ||   The treasure of the Naam is within the
        Temple of the Lord. The idiotic fools do not realize this. By
        Guru's Grace, I have realized this. I keep the Lord enshrined
        within my heart.  || 7 ||   Those who are attuned to the love
        of the Shabad know the Guru, through the Word of the Guru's
        Bani. Sacred, pure and immaculate are those humble beings who
        are absorbed in the Name of the Lord.  || 8 ||   The Temple of
        the Lord is the Lord's Shop; He embellishes it with the
        Word of His Shabad. In that shop is the merchandise of the One
        Name; the Gurmukhs adorn themselves with it.  || 9 ||   The mind
        is like iron slag, within the Temple of the Lord; it is lured
        by the love of duality. Meeting with the Guru, the Philosopher's
        Stone, the mind is transformed into gold. Its value cannot be
        described.  || 10 ||   The Lord abides within the Temple of the
        Lord. He is pervading in all. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs trade in the
        merchandise of Truth.  || 11 || 1 ||   PRABHAATEE,  THIRD MEHL:
        Those who remain awake and aware in the Love and Fear of God,
        rid themselves of the filth and pollution of egotism. They remain
        awake and aware forever, and protect their homes, by beating and
        driving out the five thieves.  || 1 ||   O my mind, as Gurmukh,
        meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O mind, do only those
        deeds which will lead you to the Path of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The celestial melody wells up in the Gurmukh, and the pains
        of egotism are taken away. The Name of the Lord abides in the
        mind, as one intuitively sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   Those who follow the Guru's Teachings -
        their faces are radiant and beautiful. They keep the Lord enshrined
        in their hearts. Here and hereafter, they find absolute peace;
        chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, they are carried across
        to the other shore. <br>

      <p> || 3 ||   In egotism, one cannot remain awake and aware, and one's
        devotional worship of the Lord is not accepted. The self-willed
        manmukhs find no place in the Court of the Lord; they do their
        deeds in the love of duality.  || 4 ||   Cursed is the food, and
        cursed are the clothes, of those who are attached to the love
        of duality. They are like maggots in manure, sinking into manure.
        In death and rebirth, they are wasted away to ruin.  || 5 || 
        I am a sacrifice to those who meet with the True Guru. I shall
        continue to associate with them; devoted to Truth, I am absorbed
        in Truth.  || 6 ||   By perfect destiny, the Guru is found. He
        cannot be found by any efforts. Through the True Guru, intuitive
        wisdom wells up; through the Word of the Shabad, egotism is burnt
        away.  || 7 ||   O my mind, hurry to the Sanctuary of the Lord;
        He is Potent to do everything. O Nanak, never forget the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Whatever He does, comes to pass.  || 8 ||

        - involved with them, people eat the food of bliss. The
        mind is entangled in sweet emotional attachment. Those who seek
        God's Glorious Virtues are the support of my breath of
        life.  || 1 ||   My One Lord is the Inner-Knower, the Searcher
        of hearts. He alone is my Support; He is my only Protection. My
        Great Lord and Master is over and above the heads of kings.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   I have broken my ties to that deceitful serpent.
        The Guru has told me that it is false and fraudulent. Its face
        is sweet, but it tastes very bitter. My mind remains satisfied
        with the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   I have
        broken my ties with greed and emotional attachment. The Merciful
        Guru has rescued me from them. These cheating thieves have plundered
        so many homes. The Merciful Guru has protected and saved me. 
        || 3 ||   I have no dealings whatsoever with sexual desire and
        anger. I listen to the Guru's Teachings. Wherever I look,
        I see the most horrible goblins. My Guru, the Lord of the World,
        has saved me from them.  || 4 ||   I have made widows of the ten
        sensory organs. The Guru has told me that these pleasures are
        the fires of corruption. Those who associate with them go to hell.
        The Guru has saved me; I am lovingly attuned to the Lord.  ||
        5 ||   I have forsaken the advice of my ego. The Guru has told
        me that this is foolish stubbornness. This ego is homeless; it
        shall never find a home. The Guru has saved me; I am lovingly
        attuned to the Lord.  || 6 ||   I have become alienated from these
        people. We cannot both live together in one home. Grasping the
        hem of the Guru's Robe, I have come to God. Please be fair
        with me, All-knowing Lord God.  || 7 ||   God smiled at me and
        spoke, passing judgement. He made all the demons perform service
        for me. You are my Lord and Master; all this home belongs to You.
        Says Nanak, the Guru has passed judgement.  || 8 || 1 ||   PRABHAATEE,

      <p> Within the mind are sexual desire, emotional attachment and egotism.
        Worship services are performed with great pomp and ceremony. Ritual
        cleansing baths are taken, and sacred marks are applied to the
        body. But still, the filth and pollution within never depart.
        || 1 ||   No one has ever found God in this way. The sacred mudras
        - ritualistic hand gestures - are made, but the
        mind remains enticed by Maya.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They commit
        sins, under the influence of the five thieves. They bathe at sacred
        shrines, and claim that everything has been washed off. Then they
        commit them again, without fear of the consequences. The sinners
        are bound and gagged,  and taken to the City of Death.  || 2 ||
        The ankle-bells shake and the cymbals vibrate, but those who
        have deception within wander lost like demons. By destroying its
        hole, the snake is not killed. God, who created you, knows everything.
        || 3 ||   You worship fire and wear saffron colored robes. Stung
        by your misfortune, you abandon your home. Leaving your own country,
        you wander in foreign lands. But you bring the five rejects with
        you.  || 4 ||   You have split your ears, and now you steal crumbs.
        You beg from door to door, but you fail to be satisfied. You have
        abandoned your own wife, but now you sneak glances at other women.
        God is not found by wearing religious robes; you are utterly miserable!
        || 5 ||   He does not speak; he is on silence. But he is filled
        with desire; he is made to wander in reincarnation. Abstaining
        from food, his body suffers in pain. He does not realize the Hukam
        of the Lord's Command; he is afflicted by possessiveness.
        || 6 ||   Without the True Guru, no one has attained the supreme
        status. Go ahead and ask all the Vedas and the Simritees. The
        self-willed manmukhs do useless deeds. They are like a house of
        sand, which cannot stand.  || 7 ||   One unto whom the Lord of
        the Universe becomes Merciful, sews the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad into his robes. Out of millions, it is rare that such a
        Saint is seen. O Nanak, with him, we are carried across.  || 8
        ||   If one has such good destiny, then the Blessed Vision of
        His Darshan is obtained. He saves himself, and carries across
        all his family as well.  || 1 ||  SECOND PAUSE  || 2 ||   PRABHAATEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, all the residues
        of sinful mistakes are erased. The accounts held by the Righteous
        Judge of Dharma are torn up. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, I have found the Sublime Essence of the Lord. The
        Supreme Lord God has melted into my heart.  || 1 ||   Dwelling
        on the Lord, Har, Har, I have found peace. Your slaves seek the
        Sanctuary of Your Feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The cycle of reincarnation
        is ended, and darkness is dispelled. The Guru has revealed the
        door of liberation. My mind and body are forever imbued with loving
        devotion to the Lord. Now I know God, because He has made me know
        Him.  || 2 ||   He is contained in each and every heart. Without
        Him, there is no one at all. Hatred, conflict, fear and doubt
        have been eliminated. God, the Soul of Pure Goodness, has manifested
        His Righteousness.  || 3 ||   He has rescued me from the most
        dangerous waves. Separated from Him for countless lifetimes, I
        am united with Him once again. Chanting, intense meditation and
        strict self-discipline are the contemplation of the Naam. My Lord
        and Master has blessed me with His Glance of Grace.  || 4 || <br>

      <p> Bliss, peace and salvation are found in that place, where the
        servants of the Lord of the World abide. God, the Lord of the
        World, is pleased and satisfied with me. My disharmony with Him
        of so many lifetimes is ended.  || 5 ||   Burnt offerings, sacred
        feasts, intense meditations with the body upside-down, worship
        services and taking millions of cleansing baths at sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage - the merits of all these are obtained by
        enshrining the Lord's Lotus Feet within the heart, even
        for an instant. Meditating on the Lord of the Universe, all one's
        affairs are resolved.  || 6 ||   God's Place is the highest
        of the high. The Lord's humble servants intuitively focus
        their meditation on Him. I long for the dust of the slaves of
        the Lord's slaves. My Beloved Lord is overflowing with
        all powers.  || 7 ||   My Beloved Lord, my Mother and Father,
        is always near. O my Friend and Companion, You are my Trusted
        Support. God takes His slaves by the hand, and makes them His
        Own. Nanak lives by meditating on the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue.

      <p> <font color="#000000">My anxious fears of death and rebirth have
        been taken away. The Celestial Lord has shown His Love for me.
        || 1 ||   The Divine Light has dawned, and darkness has been
        dispelled. Contemplating the Lord, I have obtained the Jewel of
        His Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Pain runs far away from that place
        where there is bliss. The jewel of the mind is focused and attuned
        to the essence of reality.  || 2 ||   Whatever happens is by the
        Pleasure of Your Will. Whoever understands this, is intuitively
        merged in the Lord.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, the residues of my
        sinful mistakes have been obliterated. My mind has merged into
        the Lord, the Life of the World.  || 4 || 1 ||   PRABHAATEE: 
        If the Lord Allah lives only in the mosque, then to whom does
        the rest of the world belong? According to the Hindus, the Lord's
        Name abides in the idol, but there is no truth in either of these
        claims.  || 1 ||   O Allah, O Raam, I live by Your Name. Please
        show mercy to me, O Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The God of the
        Hindus lives in the southern lands, and the God of the Muslims
        lives in the west. So search in your heart - look deep
        into your heart of hearts; this is the home and the place where
        God lives.  || 2 ||   The Brahmins observe twenty-four fasts during
        the year, and the Muslims fast during the month of Ramadaan. The
        Muslims set aside eleven months, and claim that the treasure is
        only in the one month.  || 3 ||   What is the use of bathing at
        Orissa? Why do the Muslims bow their heads in the mosque? If someone
        has deception in his heart, what good is it for him to utter prayers?
        And what good is it for him to go on pilgrimage to Mecca?  ||
        4 ||   You fashioned all these men and women, Lord. All these
        are Your Forms. Kabeer is the child of God, Allah, Raam. All the
        Gurus and prophets are mine.  || 5 ||   Says Kabeer, listen, O
        men and women: seek the Sanctuary of the One. Chant the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, O mortals, and you shall surely be carried
        across.  || 6 || 2 ||   PRABHAATEE:  First, Allah created the
        Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings.
        From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good,
        and who is bad? <br>

      <p> || 1 ||   O people, O Siblings of Destiny, do not wander deluded
        by doubt. The Creation is in the Creator, and the Creator is in
        the Creation, totally pervading and permeating all places.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The clay is the same, but the Fashioner has
        fashioned it in various ways. There is nothing wrong with the
        pot of clay - there is nothing wrong with the Potter. 
        || 2 ||   The One True Lord abides in all; by His making, everything
        is made. Whoever realizes the Hukam of His Command, knows the
        One Lord. He alone is said to be the Lord's slave.  ||
        3 ||   The Lord Allah is Unseen; He cannot be seen. The Guru has
        blessed me with this sweet molasses. Says Kabeer, my anxiety and
        fear have been taken away; I see the Immaculate Lord pervading
        everywhere.  || 4 || 3 ||   PRABHAATEE:  Do not say that the Vedas,
        the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate
        them are false. You say that the One Lord is in all, so why do
        you kill chickens?  || 1 ||   O Mullah, tell me: is this God's
        Justice? The doubts of your mind have not been dispelled.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   You seize a living creature, and then bring
        it home and kill its body; you have killed only the clay. The
        light of the soul passes into another form. So tell me, what have
        you killed?  || 2 ||   And what good are your purifications? Why
        do you bother to wash your face? And why do you bother to bow
        your head in the mosque? Your heart is full of hypocrisy; what
        good are your prayers or your pilgrimage to Mecca?  || 3 ||  
        You are impure; you do not understand the Pure Lord. You do not
        know His Mystery. Says Kabeer, you have missed out on paradise;
        your mind is set on hell.  || 4 || 4 ||   PRABHAATEE:  Hear my
        prayer, Lord; You are the Divine Light of the Divine, the Primal,
        All-pervading Master. The Siddhas in Samaadhi have not found Your
        limits. They hold tight to the Protection of Your Sanctuary. 
        || 1 ||   Worship and adoration of the Pure, Primal Lord comes
        by worshipping the True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny. Standing
        at His Door, Brahma studies the Vedas, but he cannot see the Unseen
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   With the oil of knowledge about the
        essence of reality, and the wick of the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, this lamp illluminates my body. I have applied the Light
        of the Lord of the Universe, and lit this lamp. God the Knower
        knows.  || 2 ||   The Unstruck Melody of the Panch Shabad, the
        Five Primal Sounds, vibrates and resounds. I dwell with the Lord
        of the World. Kabeer, Your slave, performs this Aartee, this lamp-lit
        worship service for You, O Formless Lord of Nirvaanaa.  || 3 ||

        Lord of the World. My God is All-pervading everywhere.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The mind is the shop, the mind is the town, and the
        mind is the shopkeeper. The mind abides in various forms, wandering

      <p> He Himself is the Commander; all are under His Command. The Fearless
        Lord looks on all alike.  || 3 ||   That humble being who knows,
        and meditates on the Supreme Primal Being - his word becomes
        eternal. Says Naam Dayv, I have found the Invisible, Wondrous
        Lord, the Life of the World, within my heart.  || 4 || 1 ||  
        PRABHAATEE:  He existed in the beginning, in the primeval age,
        and all throughout the ages; His limits cannot be known. The Lord
        is pervading and permeating amongst all; this is how His Form
        can be described.  || 1 ||   The Lord of the Universe appears
        when the Word of His Shabad is chanted. My Lord is the Embodiment
        of Bliss.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The beautiful fragrance of sandalwood
        emanates from the sandalwood tree, and attaches to the other trees
        of the forest. God, the Primal Source of everything, is like the
        sandalwood tree; He transforms us woody trees into fragrant sandalwood.
        || 2 ||   You, O Lord, are the Philosopher's Stone, and
        I am iron; associating with You, I am transformed into gold. You
        are Merciful; You are the gem and the jewel. Naam Dayv is absorbed
        in the Truth.  || 3 || 2 ||   PRABHAATEE:  The Primal Being has
        no ancestry; He has staged this play. God is hidden deep within
        each and every heart.  || 1 ||   No one knows the Light of the
        soul. Whatever I do, is known to You, Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Just as the pitcher is made from clay, everything is made from
        the Beloved Divine Creator Himself.  || 2 ||   The mortal's
        actions hold the soul in the bondage of karma. Whatever he does,
        he does on his own.  || 3 ||   Prays Naam Dayv, whatever this
        soul wants, it obtains. Whoever abides in the Lord, becomes immortal.
