      <p> God has showered His Mercy on servant Nanak; He has lifted him
        up, and rescued him from the ocean of poison.  || 4 || 6 ||  
        MALAAR,  FOURTH MEHL:  Those who do not drink in the Ambrosial
        Nectar by Guru's Grace - their thirst and hunger
        are not relieved. The foolish self-willed manmukh burns in the
        fire of egotistical pride; he suffers painfully in egotism. Coming
        and going, he wastes his life uselessly; afflicted with pain,
        he regrets and repents. He does not even think of the One, from
        whom he originated. Cursed is his life, and cursed is his food.
        || 1 ||   O mortal, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. The Lord, Har, Har, in His Mercy leads the mortal
        to meet the Guru; he is absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The life of the self-willed manmukh
        is useless; he comes and goes in shame. In sexual desire and anger,
        the proud ones are drowned. They are burnt in their egotism. They
        do not attain perfection or understanding; their intellect is
        dimmed. Tossed by the waves of greed, they suffer in pain. Without
        the Guru, they suffer in terrible pain. Seized by Death, they
        weep and wail.  || 2 ||   As Gurmukh, I have attained the Unfathomable
        Name of the Lord, with intuitive peace and poise. The treasure
        of the Naam abides deep within my heart. My tongue sings the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord. I am forever in bliss, day and night, lovingly
        attuned to the One Word of the Shabad. I have obtained the treasure
        of the Naam with intuitive ease; this is the glorious greatness
        of the True Guru.  || 3 ||   Through the True Guru, the Lord,
        Har, Har, comes to dwell within my mind. I am forever a sacrifice
        to the True Guru. I have dedicated my mind and body to Him, and
        placed everything before Him in offering. I focus my consciousness
        on His Feet. Please be merciful to me, O my Perfect Guru, and
        unite me with Yourself. I am just iron; the Guru is the boat,
        to carry me across.  || 4 || 7 || <br>

        the wealth of the Lord, and gather only the wealth of the Lord.
        No thief can ever steal it.  || 1 ||   The sparrow-hawks and the
        peacocks sing day and night, hearing the thunder in the clouds.
        || 2 ||   Whatever the deer, the fish and the birds sing, they
        chant to the Lord, and no other.  || 3 ||   Servant Nanak sings
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises; the sound and fury of
        Death has totally gone away.  || 4 || 1 || 8 ||   MALAAR,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  They speak and chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam;
        the very fortunate ones seek Him. Whoever shows me the Way of
        the Lord -  I fall at his feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        Lord is my Friend and Compansion; I am in love with the Lord. <br>

      <p> I sing of the Lord, and I speak of the Lord; I have discarded
        all other loves.  || 1 ||   My Beloved is the Enticer of the mind;
        The Detached Lord God is the Embodiment of Supreme bliss. Nanak
        lives by gazing upon the Lord; may I see Him for a moment, for
        even just an instant.  || 2 || 2 || 9 || 9 || 13 || 9 || 31 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">What are you so worried about? What are you
        thinking? What have you tried? Tell me - the Lord of the
        Universe - who controls Him?  || 1 ||   The rain showers
        down from the clouds, O companion. The Guest has come into my
        home. I am meek; my Lord and Master is the Ocean of Mercy. I am
        absorbed in the nine treasures of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have prepared all sorts of foods in various
        ways, and all sorts of sweet deserts. I have made my kitchen pure
        and sacred. Now, O my Sovereign Lord King, please sample my food.
        || 2 ||   The villains have been destroyed, and my friends are
        delighted. This is Your Own Mansion and Temple, O Lord. When my
        Playful Beloved came into my household, then I found total peace.
        || 3 ||   In the Society of the Saints, I have the Support and
        Protection of the Perfect Guru; this is the pre-ordained destiny
        inscribed upon my forehead. Servant Nanak has found his Playful
        Husband Lord. He shall never suffer in sorrow again.  || 4 ||
        1 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  When the baby's only food
        is milk, it cannot survive without its milk. The mother takes
        care of it, and pours milk into its mouth; then, it is satisfied
        and fulfilled.  || 1 ||   I am just a baby; God, the Great Giver,
        is my Father. The child is so foolish; it makes so many mistakes.
        But it has nowhere else to go.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The mind
        of the poor child is fickle; he touches even snakes and fire.
        His mother and father hug him close in their embrace, and so he
        plays in joy and bliss.  || 2 ||   What hunger can the child ever
        have, O my Lord and Master, when You are his Father? The treasure
        of the Naam and the nine treasures are in Your celestial household.
        You fulfill the desires of the mind.  || 3 ||   My Merciful Father
        has issued this Command: whatever the child asks for, is put into
        his mouth. Nanak, the child, longs for the Blessed Vision of God's
        Darshan. May His Feet always dwell within my heart.  || 4 || 2
        ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  I tried everything, and gathered all
        devices together; I have discarded all my anxieties. I have begun
        to set all my household affairs right; I have placed my faith
        in my Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   I listen to the celestial vibrations
        resonating and resounding. Sunrise has come, and I gaze upon the
        Face of my Beloved. My household is filled with peace and pleasure.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I focus my mind, and embellish and adorn
        the place within; then I go out to speak with the Saints. <br>

      <p> Seeking and searching, I have found my Husband Lord; I bow at
        His Feet and worship Him with devotion.  || 2 ||   When my Beloved
        came to live in my house, I began to sing the songs of bliss.
        My friends and companions are happy; God leads me to meet the
        Perfect Guru.  || 3 ||   My friends and companions are in ecstasy;
        the Guru has completed all my projects. Says Nanak, I have met
        my Husband, the Giver of peace; He shall never leave me and go
        away.  || 4 || 3 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  From a king to a worm,
        and from a worm to the lord of gods, they engage in evil to fill
        their bellies. They renounce the Lord, the Ocean of Mercy, and
        worship some other; they are thieves and killers of the soul.
        || 1 ||   Forgetting the Lord, they suffer in sorrow and die.
        They wander lost in reincarnation through all sorts of species;
        they do not find shelter anywhere.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those
        who abandon their Lord and Master and think of some other, are
        foolish, stupid, idiotic donkeys. How can they cross over the
        ocean in a paper boat? Their eogtistical boasts that they will
        cross over are meaningless.  || 2 ||   Shiva, Brahma, angels and
        demons, all burn in the fire of death. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary
        of the Lord's Lotus Feet; O God, Creator, please do not
        send me into exile.  || 3 || 4 || <br>

        Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Associating with the Saints, God has
        come into my consciousness. By their Grace, I have been awakened.
        Hearing the Teachings, my mind has become immaculate. Imbued with
        the Lord's Love, I sing His Glorious Praises.  || 1 ||
        Dedicating this mind, I have made friends with the Saints. They
        have become merciful to me; I am very fortunate. I have found
        absolute peace - I cannot describe it. Nanak has obtained
        the dust of the feet of the humble.  || 2 || 1 || 5 ||   MALAAR,
        FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, please lead me to union with my Beloved.
        All my friends and companions sleep totally in peace; their Beloved
        Lord has come into the homes of their hearts.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I am worthless; God is forever Merciful. I am unworthy;
        what clever tricks could I try? I claim to be on a par with those
        who are imbued with the Love of their Beloved. This is my stubborn
        egotism.  || 1 ||   I am dishonored - I seek the Sanctuary
        of the One, the Guru, the True Guru, the Primal Being, the Giver
        of peace. In an instant, all my pains have been taken away; Nanak
        passes the night of his life in peace.  || 2 || 2 || 6 ||   MALAAR,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Rain down, O cloud; do not delay. O beloved cloud,
        O support of the mind, you bring lasting bliss and joy to the
        mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  || <br>

      <p> I take to Your Support, O my Lord and Master; how could You forget
        me? I am Your beautiful bride, Your servant and slave. I have
        no nobility without my Husband Lord.  || 1 ||   When my Lord and
        Master listened to my prayer, He hurried to shower me with His
        Mercy. Says Nanak, I have become just like my Husband Lord; I
        am blessed with honor, nobility and the lifestyle of goodness.
        || 2 || 3 || 7 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate on the True
        Name of your Beloved. The pains and sorrows of the terrifying
        world-ocean are dispelled, by enshrining the Image of the Guru
        within your heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your enemies shall be
        destroyed, and all the evil-doers shall perish, when you come
        to the Sanctuary of the Lord. The Savior Lord has given me His
        Hand and saved me; I have obtained the wealth of the Naam.  ||
        1 ||   Granting His Grace, He has eradicated all the sinful residues
        of my past mistakes; He has placed the Immaculate Naam within
        my mind. O Nanak, the Treasure of Virtue fills my mind; I shall
        never again suffer in pain.  || 2 || 4 || 8 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  My Beloved God is the Lover of my breath of life. Please

        and Compassionate Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I meditate in remembrance
        on Your Feet, O my Beloved; my heart is filled with hope. I offer
        my prayer to the humble Saints; my mind thirsts for the Blssed
        Vision of the Lord's Darshan.  || 1 ||   Separation is
        death, and Union with the Lord is life. Please bless Your humble
        servant with Your Darshan. O my God, please be Merciful, and bless
        Nanak with the support, the life and wealth of the Naam.  || 2
        || 5 || 9 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  Now, I have become just like
        my Beloved. Dwelling on my Sovereign Lord King, I have found peace.
        Rain down, O peace-giving cloud.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I cannot
        forget Him, even for an instant; He is the Ocean of peace. Through
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I have obtained the nine treasures.
        My perfect destiny has been activated, meeting with the Saints,
        my help and support.  || 1 ||   Peace has welled up, and all pain
        has been dispelled, lovingly attuned to the Supreme Lord God.
        The arduous and terrifying world-ocean is crossed over, O Nanak,
        by meditating on the Feet of the Lord.  || 2 || 6 || 10 ||   MALAAR,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The clouds have rained down all over the world.
        My Beloved Lord God has become merciful to me; I am blessed with
        ecstasy, bliss and peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My sorrows are
        erased, and all my thirsts are quenched, meditating on the Supreme
        Lord God. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, death
        and birth come to an end, and the mortal does not wander anywhere,
        ever again.  || 1 ||   My mind and body are imbued with the Immaculate
        Naam, the Name of the Lord; I am lovingly attuned to His Lotus
        Feet. God has made Nanak His Own; slave Nanak seeks His Sanctuary.
        || 2 || 7 || 11 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  Separated from the
        Lord, how can any living being live? My consciousness is filled
        with yearning and hope to meet my Lord, and drink in the sublime
        essence of His Lotus Feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who are

      <p> Those who forget my Beloved Lord are dead and dying.  || 1 ||
        The Lord of the Universe is permeating and pervading my mind
        and body; I see Him Ever-present, here and now. O Nanak, He is
        permeating the inner being of all; He is all-pervading everywhere.
        || 2 || 8 || 12 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  Vibrating and meditating
        on the Lord, who has not been carried across? Those reborn into
        the body of a bird, the body of a fish, the body of a deer, and
        the body of a bull - in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, they are saved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The families of
        gods, the families of demons, titans, celestial singers and human
        beings are carried across the ocean. Whoever meditates and vibrates
        on the Lord in the Saadh Sangat - his pains are taken away.
        || 1 ||   Sexual desire, anger and the pleasures of terrible
        corruption - he keeps away from these. He meditates on
        the Lord, Merciful to the meek, the Embodiment of Compassion;
        Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him.  || 2 || 9 || 13 ||   MALAAR,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Today, I am seated in the Lord's store. With
        the wealth of the Lord, I have entered into partnership with the
        humble; I shall not have take the Highway of Death.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Showering me with His Kindness, the Supreme Lord God
        has saved me; the doors of doubt have been opened wide. I have
        found God, the Banker of Infinity; I have earned the profit of
        the wealth of His Feet.  || 1 ||   I have grasped the protection
        of the Sanctuary of the Unchanging, Unmoving, Imperishable Lord;
        He has picked up my sinful residues and thrown them out. Slave
        Nanak's sorrow and suffering has ended. He shall never
        again be squeezed into the mold of reincarnation.  || 2 || 10
        || 14 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  In so many ways, attachment to
        Maya leads to ruin. Among millions, it is very rare to find a
        selfless servant who remains a perfect devotee for very long.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Roaming and wandering here and there, the
        mortal finds only trouble; his body and wealth become strangers
        to himself. Hiding from people, he practices deception; he does

        through troubled incarnations of low and wretched species as a

        the Company of the Holy.  || 2 || 11 || 15 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The cruel and evil ones died after taking poison, O mother.
        And the One, to whom all creatures belong, has saved us. God has
        granted His Grace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Inner-knower, the
        Searcher of hearts, is contained within all; why should I be afraid,
        O Siblings of Destiny? God, my Help and Support, is always with
        me. He shall never leave; I see Him everywhere.  || 1 ||   He
        is the Master of the masterless, the Destroyer of the pains of
        the poor; He has attached me to the hem of His robe. O Lord, Your
        slaves live by Your Support; Nanak has come to the Sanctuary of
        God.  || 2 || 12 || 16 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my mind, dwell
        on the Feet of the Lord. My mind is enticed by thirst for the
        Blessed Vision of the Lord; I would take wings and fly out to
        meet Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Searching and seeking, I have
        found the Path, and now I serve the Holy. O my Lord and Master,
        please be kind to me, that I may drink in Your most sublime essence.
        || 1 ||   Begging and pleading, I have come to Your Sanctuary;
        I am on fire - please shower me with Your Mercy! Please
        give me Your Hand - I am Your slave, O Lord. <br>

        throughout the world. He blesses all creatures with compassion.
        Hugging him close in His Embrace, the Lord saves and protects
        His slave. The hot winds cannot even touch him.  || 1 ||   My
        Lord and Master has made me His Own; dispelling my doubts and
        fears, He has made me happy. The Lord's slaves enjoy ultimate

        The Gurmukh knows that the universe is the extension of the three
        gunas, the three dispositions. The Gurmukh reflects on the Sound-current
        of the Naad, and the wisdom of the Vedas. Without the Perfect
        Guru, there is only pitch-black darkness.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        calling on the Guru, eternal peace is found. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, the Lord comes to dwell within the heart; I meditate
        on my Lord and Master with every breath and morsel of food.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   I am a sacrifice to the Guru's Feet.
        Night and day, I continually sing the Glorious Praises of the
        Guru. I take my cleansing bath in the dust of the Guru's
        Feet. I am honored in the True Court of the Lord.  || 2 ||   The
        Guru is the boat, to carry me across the terrifying world-ocean.
        Meeting with the Guru, I shall not be reincarnated ever again.
        That humble being serves the Guru, who has such karma inscribed
        on his forehead by the Primal Lord.  || 3 ||   The Guru is my
        life; the Guru is my support. The Guru is my way of life; the
        Guru is my family. The Guru is my Lord and Master; I seek the
        Sanctuary of the True Guru. O Nanak, the Guru is the Supreme Lord
        God; His value cannot be estimated.  || 4 || 1 || 19 ||   MALAAR,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I enshrine the Lord's Feet within my heart;
        in His Mercy, God has united me with Himself. God enjoins His
        servant to his tasks. His worth cannot be expressed.  || 1 ||
        Please be merciful to me, O Perfect Giver of peace. By Your
        Grace, You come to mind; I am imbued with Your Love, twenty-four
        hours a day.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Singing and listening, it is
        all by Your Will. One who understands the Hukam of Your Command
        is absorbed in Truth. Chanting and meditating on Your Name, I
        live. Without You, there is no place at all.  || 2 ||   Pain and
        pleasure come by Your Command, O Creator Lord. By the Pleasure
        of Your Will You forgive, and by the Pleasure of Your Will You
        award punishment. You are the Creator of both realms. I am a sacrifice
        to Your Glorious Grandeur.  || 3 ||   You alone know Your value.
        You alone understand, You Yourself speak and listen. <br>

        is forever a sacrifice to them.  || 4 || 2 || 20 ||   MALAAR,

        Nectar is raining down from the clouds. All beings and creatures
        are satisfied; their affairs are perfectly resolved.  || 1 ||
        O my mind, dwell on the Lord, forever and ever. Serving the
        Perfect Guru, I have obtained it. It shall stay with me both here
        and hereafter.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is the Destroyer of pain,
        the Eradicator of fear. He takes care of His beings. The Savior
        Lord is kind and compassionate forever. I am a sacrifice to Him,
        forever and ever.  || 2 ||   The Creator Himself has eliminated
        death. Meditate on Him forever and ever, O my mind. He watches
        all with His Glance of Grace and protects them. Continually and
        continuously, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord God.  || 3
        ||   The One and Only Creator Lord is Himself by Himself. The
        Lord's devotees know His Glorious Grandeur. He preserves
        the Honor of His Name. Nanak speaks as the Lord inspires him to
        speak.  || 4 || 3 || 21 ||   MALAAR,  FIFTH MEHL:  All treasures
        are found in the Sanctuary of the Guru. Honor is obtained in the
        True Court of the Lord. Doubt, fear, pain and suffering are taken
        away, forever singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord in the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||   O my mind, praise
        the Perfect Guru. Chant the treasure of the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, day and night. You shall obtain the fruits of your mind's
        desires.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   No one else is as great as the
        True Guru. The Guru is the Supreme Lord, the Transcendent Lord
        God. He saves us from the pains of death and birth, and we will
        not have to taste the poison of Maya ever again.  || 2 ||   The
        Guru's glorious grandeur cannot be described. The Guru
        is the Transcendent Lord, in the True Name. True is His self-discipline,
        and True are all His actions. Immaculate and pure is that mind,
        which is imbued with love for the Guru.  || 3 ||   The Perfect
        Guru is obtained by great good fortune. Drive out sexual desire,
        anger and greed from your mind. By His Grace, the Guru's
        Feet are enshrined within. Nanak offers his prayer to the True
        Lord God.  || 4 || 4 || 22 || <br>

        the three dispositions - has come to entice me; whom can
        I tell of my pain?  || 1 ||   I tried everything else, but nothing

        the sublime grandeur of my Love is totally pervading. In the Saadh

        Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, millions of sins are

        || 1 ||   The peacock loves the thunder of the rain clouds. The

        if it is Your Will.  || 2 ||   Sleep is gone, and egotism is exhausted
        from my body; my heart is permeated with the Teachings of Truth.
        || 3 ||   Flying among the trees and plants, I remain hungry;
        lovingly drinking in the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I am satisfied.
        || 4 ||   I stare at You, and my tongue cries out to You; I am
        so thirsty for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.  || 5 ||  
        Without my Beloved, the more I decorate myself, the more my body
        burns; these clothes do not look good on my body.  || 6 ||   Without
        my Beloved, I cannot survive even for an instant; without meeting
        Him, I cannot sleep.  || 7 ||   Her Husband Lord is nearby, but
        the wretched bride does not know it. The True Guru reveals Him
        to her.  || 8 ||   When she meets Him with intuitive ease, she
        finds peace; the Word of the Shabad quenches the fire of desire.
        || 9 ||   Says Nanak, through You, O Lord, my mind is pleased
        and appeased; I cannot express Your worth.  || 10 || 3 || <br>

        the lofty mountains and the caverns of the underworld. Contemplating
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the oceans become calm.
        The path of liberation is found by subduing the ego.  || 1 ||
        I am blind; I seek the Light of the Name. I take the Support
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I walk on the path of mystery
        of the Guru's Fear.  || 1 || <br>

      <p> Pause  ||   Through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, the
        Path is known. With the Guru's Support, one is blessed
        with the strength of the True Lord. Dwell on the Naam, and realize
        the Beauteous Word of His Bani. If it is Your Will, Lord, You
        lead me to find Your Door.  || 2 ||   Flying high or sitting down,
        I am lovingly focused on the One Lord. Through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, I take the Naam as my Suppport. There is
        no ocean of water, no mountain ranges rising up. I dwell within
        the home of my own inner being, where there is no path and no
        one travelling on it.  || 3 ||   You alone know the way to that
        House in which You dwell. No one else knows the Mansion of Your
        Presence. Without the True Guru, there is no understanding. The
        whole world is buried under its nightmare. The mortal tries all
        sorts of things, and weeps and wails, but without the Guru, he
        does not know the Naam, the Name of the Lord. In the twinkling
        of an eye, the Naam saves him, if he realizes the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad.  || 4 ||   Some are foolish, blind, stupid
        and ignorant. Some, through fear of the True Guru, take the Support
        of the Naam. The True Word of His Bani is sweet, the source of
        ambrosial nectar. Whoever drinks it in, finds the Door of Salvation.
        || 5 ||   One who, through the love and fear of God, enshrines
        the Naam within his heart, acts according to the Guru's
        Instructions and knows the True Bani. When the clouds release
        their rain, the earth becomes beautiful; God's Light permeates
        each and every heart. The evil-minded ones plant their seed in
        the barren soil; such is the sign of those who have no Guru. Without
        the True Guru, there is utter darkness; they drown there, even
        without water.  || 6 ||   Whatever God does, is by His Own Will.
        That which is pre-ordained cannot be erased. Bound to the Hukam
        of the Lord's Command, the mortal does his deeds. Permeated
        by the One Word of the Shabad, the mortal is immersed in Truth.
        || 7 ||   Your Command, O God, rules in the four directions;
        Your Name pervades the four corners of the nether regions as well.
        The True Word of the Shabad is pervading amongst all. By His Grace,
        the Eternal One unites us with Himself. Birth and death hang over
        the heads of all beings, along with hunger, sleep and dying. The
        Naam is pleasing to Nanak's mind; O True Lord, Source of
        bliss, please bless me with Your Grace.  || 8 || 1 || 4 ||   MALAAR,
        FIRST MEHL:  You do not understand the nature of death and liberation.
        You are sitting on the river-bank; realize the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 1 ||   You stork! - how were you caught in
        the net? You do not remember in your heart the Unseen Lord God.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   For your one life, you consume many lives.
        You were supposed to swim in the water, but you are drowning in
        it instead.  || 2 ||   You have tormented all beings. When Death
        seizes you, then you shall regret and repent.  || 3 ||   When
        the heavy noose is placed around your neck, you may spread your
        wings, but you shall not be able to fly.  || 4 ||   You enjoy
        the tastes and flavors, you foolish self-willed manmukh. You are
        trapped. You can only be saved by virtuous conduct, spiritual
        wisdom and contemplation.  || 5 ||   Serving the True Guru, you
        will shatter the Messenger of Death. In your heart, dwell on the
        True Word of the Shabad.  || 6 ||   The Guru's Teachings,
        the True Word of the Shabad, is excellent and sublime. Keep the
        Name of the Lord enshrined in your heart.  || 7 ||   One who is
        obsessed with enjoying pleasures here, shall suffer in pain hereafter.
        O Nanak, there is no liberation without the True Name.  || 8 ||
