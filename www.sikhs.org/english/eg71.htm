        consciousness to the milk of good deeds, and then, free of desire,
        let it curdle.  || 1 ||   Chant the Name of the One Lord. All

        That humble servant who dedicates and offers his life, and who

        removed, even if it is washed a hundred times.  || 1 ||   They
        alone are my friends, who travel along with me; and in that place,
        where the accounts are called for, they appear standing with me.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There are houses, mansions and tall buildings,
        painted on all sides; but they are empty within, and they crumble
        like useless ruins.  || 2 ||   The herons in their white feathers
        dwell in the sacred shrines of pilgrimage. They tear apart and
        eat the living beings, and so they are not called white.  || 3
        ||   My body is like the simmal tree; seeing me, other people
        are fooled. Its fruits are useless - just like the qualities
        of my body.  || 4 ||   The blind man is carrying such a heavy
        load, and his journey through the mountains is so long. My eyes
        can see, but I cannot find the Way. How can I climb up and cross
        over the mountain?  || 5 ||   What good does it do to serve, and
        be good, and be clever? O Nanak, contemplate the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, and you shall be released from bondage.  || 6 ||
        1 || 3 ||   SOOHEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Build the raft of meditation
        and self-discipline, to carry you across the river. There will
        be no ocean, and no rising tides to stop you; this is how comfortable
        your path shall be.  || 1 ||   Your Name alone is the color, in
        which the robe of my body is dyed. This color is permanent, O
        my Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My beloved friends have departed;
        how will they meet the Lord? If they have virtue in their pack,
        the Lord will unite them with Himself.  || 2 ||   Once united
        with Him, they will not be separated again, if they are truly
        united. The True Lord brings their comings and goings to an end.
        || 3 ||   One who subdues and eradicates egotism, sews the robe
        of devotion. Following the Word of the Guru's Teachings,
        she receives the fruits of her reward, the Ambrosial Words of
        the Lord.  || 4 ||   Says Nanak, O soul-brides, our Husband Lord
        is so dear! We are the servants, the hand-maidens of the Lord;
        He is our True Lord and Master.  || 5 || 2 || 4 ||   SOOHEE, 
        FIRST MEHL:  Those whose minds are filled with love of the Lord,
        are blessed and exalted. They are blessed with peace, and their
        pains are forgotten. He will undoubtedly, certainly save them.
        || 1 ||   The Guru comes to meet those whose destiny is so pre-ordained.
        He blesses them with the Teachings of the Ambrosial Name of the
        Lord. Those who walk in the Will of the True Guru, never wander
        begging.  || 2 ||   And one who lives in the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, why should he bow down to any other? The gate-keeper
        at the Lord's Gate shall not stop him to ask any questions.
        And one who is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace
        - by his words, others are emancipated as well.  || 3 ||
        The Lord Himself sends out, and recalls the mortal beings; no
        one else gives Him advice. He Himself demolishes, constructs and
        creates; He knows everything. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord is the blessing, given to those who receive His Mercy, and
        His Grace.  || <br>

        which is pleasing to Him. The filthiest vessel does not become
        pure, simply by being washed. Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's
        Gate, one obtains understanding. By being washed through this
        Gate, it becomes pure. The Lord Himself sets the standards to
        differentiate between the dirty and the pure. Do not think that
        you will automatically find a place of rest hereafter. According
        to the actions one has committed, so does the mortal become. He
        Himself bestows the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. Such a mortal
        departs with honor and renown; his life is embellished and redeemed,
        and the trumpets resound with his glory. Why speak of poor mortals?
        His glory shall echo throughout the three worlds. O Nanak, he
        himself shall be enraptured, and he shall save his entire ancestry.
        || 1 || 4 || 6 ||   SOOHEE,  FIRST MEHL:  The Yogi practices
        yoga, and the pleasure-seeker practices eating. The austere practice
        austerities, bathing and rubbing themselves at sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage.  || 1 ||   Let me hear some news of You, O Beloved;
        if only someone would come and sit with me, and tell me.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   As one plants, so does he harvest; whatever he
        earns, he eats. In the world hereafter, his account is not called
        for, if he goes with the insignia of the Lord.  || 2 ||   According
        to the actions the mortal commits, so is he proclaimed. And that
        breath which is drawn without thinking of the Lord, that breath
        goes in vain.  || 3 ||   I would sell this body, if someone would
        only purchase it. O Nanak, that body is of no use at all, if it
        does not enshrine the Name of the True Lord.  || 4 || 5 || 7 || <br>

      <p> When the Guru is totally satisfied and pleased, He colors us with
        the Lord's Love; this color shall never fade away.  ||
        1 ||   O my mind, enshrine love for the Name of the Lord. The
        Guru, satisfied and pleased, taught me about the Lord, and my
        Sovereign Lord King met with me at once.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        The self-willed manmukh is like the ignorant bride, who comes
        and goes again and again in reincarnation. The Lord God does not
        come into her consciousness, and her mind is stuck in the love
        of duality.  || 2 ||   I am full of filth, and I practice evil
        deeds; O Lord, save me, be with me, merge me into Your Being!
        The Guru has bathed me in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar, and the
        dirty residues of all my sins and mistakes have been washed away.
        || 3 ||   O Lord God, Merciful to the meek and the poor, please
        unite me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Joining the
        Sangat, servant Nanak has obtained the Lord's Love; my
        mind and body are drenched in it.  || 4 || 3 ||   SOOHEE,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  One who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, while constantly
        practicing deception, shall never become pure of heart. He may
        perform all sorts of rituals, night and day, but he shall not
        find peace, even in dreams.  || 1 ||   O wise ones, without the
        Guru, there is no devotional worship.The untreated cloth does
        not take up the dye, no matter how much everyone may wish it.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukh may perform chants,
        meditations, austere self-discipline, fasts and devotional worship,
        but his sickness does not go away. Deep within him is the sickness
        of excessive egotism; in the love of duality he is ruined.  ||
        2 ||   Outwardly, he wears religious robes and he is very clever,
        but his mind wanders in the ten directions. Engrossed in ego,
        he does not remember the Word of the Shabad; over and over again,
        he is reincarnated.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, that mortal who is blessed
        with the Lord's Glance of Grace, understands Him; that
        humble servant meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. By
        Guru's Grace, he understands the One Lord, and is absorbed
        into the One Lord.  || 4 || 4 || 13 || <br>

        of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   The Lord, Har, Har, has enshrined
        peace within my mind. The fire of desire was extinguished in an

        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,

        the mortal enjoys the pleasure of His Love. He remains always
        blissful, day and night, and he merges into the Shabad, the Word

        the Lord's Love; the Gurmukh is imbued with the deep red
        color of His Love.  || 2 ||   The foolish, self-willed manmukh

        Love.  || 3 ||   But if the Lord blesses him with His Glance of

        subtle essence of the Lord's Love.  || 4 || 2 || 6 || 
        SOOHEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  My tongue remains satisfied with the subtle
        essence of the Lord. The Gurmukh drinks it in, and merges in celestial
        peace.  || 1 ||   If you taste the subtle essence of the Lord,
        O humble Siblings of Destiny, then how can you be enticed by other
        flavors?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Under Guru's Instructions,
        keep this subtle essence enshrined in your heart. Those who are
        imbued with the subtle essence of the Lord, are immersed in celestial
        bliss.  || 2 ||   The self-willed manmukh cannot even taste the
        subtle essence of the Lord. He acts out in ego, and suffers terrible
        punishment.  || 3 ||   But if he is blessed with the Lord's
        Kind Mercy, then he obtains the subtle essence of the Lord. O
        Nanak, absorbed in this subtle essence of the Lord, sing the Glorious

        Lord's Name, he obtains the state of highest dignity. Go
        and ask Bidar, the son of a maid; Krishna himself stayed in his
        house.  || 1 ||   Listen, O humble Siblings of Destiny, to the
        Unspoken Speech of the Lord; it removes all anxiety, pain and
        hunger.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Ravi Daas, the leather-worker, praised
        the Lord, and sang the Kirtan of His Praises each and every instant.
        Although he was of low social status, he was exalted and elevated,
        and people of all four castes came and bowed at his feet.  ||
        2 ||   Naam Dayv loved the Lord; the people called him a fabric
        dyer. The Lord turned His back on the high-class Kh'shaatriyas
        and Brahmins, and showed His face to Naam Dayv.  || 3 ||   All
        of the devotees and servants of the Lord have the tilak, the ceremonial
        mark, applied to their foreheads at the sixty-eight sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage. Servant Nanak shall touch their feet night and
        day, if the Lord, the King, grants His Grace.  || 4 || 1 || 8
        ||   SOOHEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  They alone worship and adore the Lord
        deep within, who are blessed with such pre-ordained destiny from
        the very beginning of time. What can anyone do to undermine them?
        My Creator Lord is on their side.  || 1 ||   So meditate on the
        Lord, Har, Har, O my mind. Meditate on the Lord, O mind; He is
        the Eliminator of all the pains of reincarnation.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   In the very beginning, the Lord blessed His devotees with
        the Ambrosial Nectar, the treasure of devotion. Anyone who tries
        to compete with them is a fool; his face shall be blackened here
        and hereafter.  || 2 ||   They alone are devotees, and they alone
        are selfless servants, who love the Lord's Name. By their
        selfless service, they find the Lord, while ashes fall on the
        heads of the slanderers.  || 3 ||   He alone knows this, who experiences
        it within the home of his own self. Ask Guru Nanak, the Guru of
        the world, and reflect upon it. Throughout the four generations
        of the Gurus, from the beginning of time and throughout the ages,
        no one has ever found the Lord by back-biting and undermining.
        Only by serving the Lord with love, is one emancipated.  || 4
        || 2 || 9 ||   SOOHEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  Wherever the Lord is worshipped

      <p> By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind; He
        cannot be obtained in any other way.  || 1 ||   So gather in the
        wealth of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, so that in this world
        and the next, the Lord shall be your friend and companion.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   In the company of the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
        you shall earn the wealth of the Lord; this wealth of the Lord
        is not obtained anywhere else, by any other means, at all. The
        dealer in the Lord's Jewels purchases the wealth of the
        Lord's jewels; the dealer in cheap glass jewels cannot
        acquire the Lord's wealth by empty words.  || 2 ||   The
        Lord's wealth is like jewels, gems and rubies. At the appointed
        time in the Amrit Vaylaa, the ambrosial hours of the morning,
        the Lord's devotees lovingly center their attention on
        the Lord, and the wealth of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord
        plant the seed of the Lord's wealth in the ambrosial hours
        of the Amrit Vaylaa; they eat it, and spend it, but it is never
        exhausted. In this world and the next, the devotees are blessed
        with glorious greatness, the wealth of the Lord.  || 3 ||   The
        wealth of the Fearless Lord is permanent, forever and ever, and
        true. This wealth of the Lord cannot be destroyed by fire or water;
        neither thieves nor the Messenger of Death can take it away. Thieves
        cannot even approach the Lord's wealth; Death, the tax
        collector cannot tax it.  || 4 ||   The faithless cynics commit
        sins and gather in their poisonous wealth, but it shall not go
        along with them for even a single step. In this world, the faithless
        cynics become miserable, as it slips away through their hands.
        In the world hereafter, the faithless cynics find no shelter in
        the Court of the Lord.  || 5 ||   The Lord Himself is the Banker
        of this wealth, O Saints; when the Lord gives it, the mortal loads
        it and takes it away. This wealth of the Lord is never exhausted;
        the Guru has given this understanding to servant Nanak.  || 6
        || 3 || 10 ||   SOOHEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  That mortal, with whom
        the Lord is pleased, repeats the Glorious Praises of the Lord;
        he alone is a devotee, and he alone is approved. How can his glory
        be described? Within his heart, the Primal Lord, the Lord God,
        abides.  || 1 ||   Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
        Universe; focus your meditation on the True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   He is the True Guru - service to the True Guru is
        fruitful and rewarding. By this service, the greatest treasure
        is obtained. The faithless cynics in their love of duality and
        sensual desires, harbor foul-smelling urges. They are totally
        useless and ignorant.  || 2 ||   One who has faith - his
        singing is approved. He is honored in the Court of the Lord. Those
        who lack faith may close their eyes, hypocritically pretending
        and faking devotion, but their false pretenses shall soon wear
        off.  || 3 ||   My soul and body are totally Yours, Lord; You
        are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, my Primal Lord God.
        So speaks servant Nanak, the slave of Your slaves; as You make
        me speak, so do I speak.  || 4 || 4 || 11 || <br>

        at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You alone are my strength, and my
        Court, O my Lord and Master; unto You alone I pray. There is no

        earth, and fire is locked up in wood. The sheep and the lions
        are kept in one place; O mortal, meditate on the Lord, and your
        doubts and fears shall be removed.  || 3 ||   So behold the glorious
        greatness of the Lord, O Saints; the Lord blesses the dishonored
        with honor. As dust rises from underfoot, O Nanak, so does the
        Lord make all people fall at the feet of the Holy.  || 4 || 1

        all the bad and the good; as it pleases You, so You make us speak.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord has infused the love of Maya into
        all bodies; through this human body, there comes the opportunity
        to worship the Lord with devotion. You unite some with the True
        Guru, and bless them with peace; while others, the self-willed
        manmukhs, are engrossed in worldly affairs.  || 2 ||   All belong

        in thousands of water jugs, but when the jugs are broken, only
        the sky remains. Doubt comes from greed, emotional attachment
        and the corruption of Maya. Freed from doubt, one realizes the
        One Lord alone.  || 3 ||   He is imperishable; He will never pass
        away. He does not come, and He does not go. The Perfect Guru has
        washed away the filth of ego. Says Nanak, I have obtained the
        supreme status.  || 4 || 1 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Whatever
        God wills, that alone happens. Without You, there is no other
        at all. The humble being serves Him, and so all his works are
        perfectly successful. O Lord, please preserve the honor of Your
        slaves.  || 1 ||   I seek Your Sanctuary, O Perfect, Merciful
        Lord. Without You, who would cherish and love me?  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   He is permeating and pervading the water, the land and the
        sky. God dwells near at hand; He is not far away. By trying to
        please other people, nothing is accomplished. <br>

      <p> When someone is attached to the True Lord, his ego is taken away.
        || 2 ||   He alone is attached, whom the Lord Himself attaches.
        The jewel of spiritual wisdom is awakened deep within. Evil-mindedness
        is eradicated, and the supreme status is attained. By Guru's
        Grace, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||  
        Pressing my palms together, I offer my prayer; if it pleases You,
        Lord, please bless me and fulfill me. Grant Your Mercy, Lord,
        and bless me with devotion. Servant Nanak meditates on God forever.
        || 4 || 2 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Blessed is that soul-bride,
        who realizes God. She obeys the Hukam of His Order, and abandons
        her self-conceit. Imbued with her Beloved, she celebrates in delight.
        || 1 ||   Listen, O my companions - these are the signs
        on the Path to meet God. Dedicate your mind and body to Him; stop
        living to please others.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One soul-bride
        counsels another, to do only that which pleases God. Such a soul-bride
        merges into the Being of God.  || 2 ||   One who is in the grip
        of pride does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
        She regrets and repents, when her life-night passes away. The
        unfortunate self-willed manmukhs suffer in pain.  || 3 ||   I
        pray to God, but I think that He is far away. God is imperishable
        and eternal; He is pervading and permeating everywhere. Servant
        Nanak sings of Him; I see Him Ever-present everywhere.  || 4 ||
        3 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Giver has put this household
        of my being under my own control. I am now the mistress of the
        Lord's Home. My Husband Lord has made the ten senses and
        organs of actions my slaves. I have gathered together all the
        faculties and facilities of this house. I am thirsty with desire
        and longing for my Husband Lord.  || 1 ||   What Glorious Virtues
        of my Beloved Husband Lord should I describe? He is All-knowing,
        totally beautiful and merciful; He is the Destroyer of ego.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   I am adorned with Truth, and I have applied
        the mascara of the Fear of God to my eyes. I have chewed the betel-leaf
        of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. My bracelets, robes
        and ornaments beautifully adorn me. The soul-bride becomes totally
        happy, when her Husband Lord comes to her home.  || 2 ||   By
        the charms of virtue, I have enticed and fascinated my Husband
        Lord. He is under my power - the Guru has dispelled my
        doubts. My mansion is lofty and elevated. Renouncing all other
        brides, my Beloved has become my lover.  || 3 ||   The sun has
        risen, and its light shines brightly. I have prepared my bed with
        infinite care and faith. My Darling Beloved is new and fresh;
        He has come to my bed to enjoy me. O Servant Nanak, my Husband
        Lord has come; the soul-bride has found peace.  || 4 || 4 || 
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  An intense yearning to meet God has welled
        up in my heart. I have gone out searching to find my Beloved Husband
        Lord. Hearing news of my Beloved, I have laid out my bed in my
        home.. Wandering, wandering all around, I came, but I did not
        even see Him.  || 1 ||   How can this poor heart be comforted?
        Come and meet me, O Friend; I am a sacrifice to You.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   One bed is spread out for the bride and her Husband
        Lord. The bride is asleep, while her Husband Lord is always awake.
        The bride is intoxicated, as if she has drunk wine. The soul-bride
        only awakens when her Husband Lord calls to her.  || 2 ||   She
        has lost hope - so many days have passed. I have travelled
        through all the lands and the countries. <br>

      <p> I cannot survive, even for an instant, without the feet of my
        Beloved. When God becomes Merciful, I become fortunate, and then
        I meet Him.  || 3 ||   Becoming Merciful, He has united me with
        the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. The fire has been quenched,
        and I have found my Husband Lord within my own home. I am now
        adorned with all sorts of decorations. Says Nanak, the Guru has
        dispelled my doubt.  || 4 ||   Wherever I look, I see my Husband
        Lord there, O Siblings of Destiny. When the door is opened, then
        the mind is restrained.  || 1 ||  Second Pause  || 5 ||   SOOHEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  What virtues and excellences of Yours should I cherish
        and contemplate? I am worthless, while You are the Great Giver.
        I am Your slave - what clever tricks could I ever try?
        This soul and body are totally Yours  || 1 ||   O my Darling,
        Blissful Beloved, who fascinates my mind - I am a sacrifice
        to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O
        God, You are the Great Giver, and I am just a poor beggar; You
        are forever and ever benevolent. I cannot accomplish anything
        by myself, O my Unapproachable and Infinite Lord and Master. 
        || 2 ||   What service can I perform? What should I say to please
        You? How can I gain the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan? Your extent
        cannot be found - Your limits cannot be found. My mind
        longs for Your Feet.  || 3 ||   I beg with persistence to receive
        this gift, that the dust of the Saints might touch my face. The
        Guru has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; reaching out with
        His Hand, God has delivered him. || 4 || 6 || <br>

        are very great. He does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, but he says that he has arrived there  || 1 ||   He
        competes with those who have been accepted by the Beloved Lord.
        This is how stubborn the false fool is!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        He wears religious robes, but he does not practice Truth. He says
        that he has found the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, but
        he cannot even get near it.  || 2 ||   He says that he is unattached,
        but he is intoxicated with Maya. There is no love in his mind,
        and yet he says that he is imbued with the Lord.  || 3 ||   Says
        Nanak, hear my prayer, God: I am silly, stubborn and filled with
        sexual desire - please, liberate me!  || 4 ||   I gaze
        upon the glorious greatness of the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
        You are the Giver of Peace, the Loving Primal Being.  || 1 ||
        Second Pause  || 1 || 7 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He gets up
        early, to do his evil deeds, but when it is time to meditate on
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, then he sleeps.  || 1 ||   The
        ignorant person does not take advantage of the opportunity. He
        is attached to Maya, and engrossed in worldly delights.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   He rides the waves of greed, puffed up with joy.
        He does not see the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy.
        || 2 ||   The ignorant clown will never understand. Again and
        again, he becomes engrossed in entanglements.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   He listens to the sounds of sin and the music of corruption,
        and he is pleased. His mind is too lazy to listen to the Praises
        of the Lord.  || 3 ||   You do not see with your eyes -
        you are so blind! You shall have to leave all these false affairs.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Says Nanak, please forgive me, God. </font><br>
