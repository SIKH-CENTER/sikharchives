      <p> This dear soul is caught and driven off, when the pre-ordained
        Order is received; all the relatives cry out in mourning. The
        body and the swan-soul become separated, when one's days
        are past and done, O my mother. As is one's pre-ordained
        Destiny, so does one receive, according to one's past actions.
        Blessed is the Creator, the True King, who has linked the whole
        world to its tasks.  || 1 ||   Meditate in remembrance on the
        Lord and Master, O my Siblings of Destiny; everyone has to pass
        this way. These false entanglements last for only a few days;
        then, one must surely move on to the world hereafter. He must
        surely move on to the world hereafter, like a guest; so why does
        he indulge in pride? Chant the Name of the Lord; serving Him,
        you shall obtain peace in His Court. In the world hereafter, no
        one's commands will be obeyed. According to their actions,
        each and every person proceeds. Meditate in remembrance on the
        Lord and Master, O my Siblings of Destiny; everyone has to pass
        this way.  || 2 ||   Whatever pleases the Almighty Lord  - 
        that alone comes to pass; this world is an opportunity to please
        Him. The True Creator Lord is pervading and permeating the water,
        the land and the air. The True Creator Lord is invisible and infinite;
        His limits cannot be found. Fruitful is the coming of those, who
        meditate single-mindedly on Him. He destroys, and having destroyed,
        He creates; by His Order, He adorns us. Whatever pleases the Almighty
        Lord  -  that alone comes to pass; this world is an opportunity
        to please Him.  || 3 ||   Nanak: he alone is known to weep, O
        Baba, who weeps in the Lord's Love. One who weeps for the
        sake of worldly objects, O Baba, weeps totally in vain. This weeping
        is totally in vain; the world forgets the Lord, and weeps for
        the sake of Maya. They do not distinguish between good and evil;
        they waste away their lives in vain. Everyone who comes here,
        shall have to leave; to act in egotism is false. Nanak: he alone
        is known to weep, O Baba, who weeps in the Lord's Love. 
        || 4 || 1 ||   WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL:  Come, O my companions  - 
        let us meet together and dwell upon the True Name. Let us weep
        over the body's separation from our Lord and Master; let
        us remember Him in contemplation. Let us remember our Lord and
        Master in contemplation, and keep a watchful eye on the Path.
        We shall have to go there as well. The One who created also destroys;
        whatever happens is by His Will. Whatever He has done, has come
        to pass; how can we command Him? Come, O my companions  - 
        let us meet together and dwell upon the True Name.  || 1 ||  
        Death would not be called bad, O people, if one knew how to truly
        die. Serve your Almighty Lord and Master, and your path in the
        world hereafter will be easy. Take this easy path, and you shall
        obtain the fruits of your rewards, and receive honor in the world
        hereafter. Go there with your offering, and you shall merge in
        the True Lord; your honor shall be confirmed. You shall obtain
        a place in the Mansion of the Lord Master's Presence; being
        pleasing to Him, you shall enjoy the pleasures of His Love. Death
        would not be called bad, O people, if one knew how to truly die.
        || 2 ||   The death of brave heroes is blessed, if it is approved
        by God. </p>

      <p> They alone are proclaimed as brave warriors in the world hereafter,
        who receive true honor in the Court of the Lord. They are honored
        in the Court of the Lord; they depart with honor, and they do
        not suffer pain in the world hereafter. They meditate on the One
        Lord, and obtain the fruits of their rewards. Serving the Lord,
        their fear is dispelled. Do not place yourself above others; dwell
        within your own mind. The Knower Himself knows everything. The
        death of brave heroes is blessed, if it is approved by God.  ||
        3 ||   Nanak: for whom should we mourn, O Baba? This world is
        merely a drama. The Lord Master beholds His work, and contemplates
        His creative potency. He contemplates His creative potency, having
        established the Universe. He who created it, He alone knows. He
        Himself beholds it, and He Himself understands it. He Himself
        realizes the Hukam of His Command. The One who created these things
        -  He alone knows. His subtle form is infinite. Nanak: for
        whom should we mourn, O Baba? This world is merely a drama.  ||
        4 || 2 ||   WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL,  DAKHANEE:  The True Creator
        Lord is True  -  know this well; He is the True Sustainer.
        He Himself fashioned Himself; the True Lord is invisible and infinite.
        He brought together and then separated the two grinding stones
        of the earth and the sky; without the Guru, there is only pitch
        darkness. He created the sun and the moon; night and day, they
        move according to His Thought.  || 1 ||   O True Lord and Master,
        You are True. O True Lord, please bless me with Your Love.  ||
        Pause  ||   You created the Universe; You are the Giver of pleasure
        and pain. You created woman and man, the love of poison and emotional
        attachment to Maya. The four sources of creation and the power
        of the Word are also of Your making. You give Support to all beings.
        You have made the Creation as Your Throne; You are the True Judge.
        || 2 ||   You created comings and goings, but You are ever-stable,
        O Creator Lord. In birth and death, in coming and going, this
        soul is held in bondage by corruption. The evil person has forgotten
        the Naam; he has drowned  -  what can he do now? Forsaking
        merit, he has loaded the poisonous cargo of demerits; he is a
        trader of sins.  || 3 ||   The beloved soul has received the Call,
        the Command of the True Creator Lord. The husband-soul has become
        separated from the body-bride. The Lord is the re-uniter of the
        separated ones. No one cares for your beauty, O beautiful bride;
        the Messenger of Death is bound only by the Commander's Command.
        He does not distinguish between young children and old people;
        he tears apart love and affection.  || 4 ||   The nine doors are
        closed by the True Lord's Command, and the swan-soul takes
        flight into the skies. The body-bride is separated, and defrauded
        by falsehood; she is now a widow  -  the dead body lies in
        the courtyard. The widow cries out at the door, &quot;The light
        of my mind has gone out, O my mother, with his death.&quot; So
        cry out, O soul-brides of the Husband Lord, and dwell on the Glorious
        Praises of the True Lord.  || 5 ||   Her loved one is cleansed,
        bathed in water, and dressed in silken robes. The musicians play,
        and the Bani of the True Word is sung; the five relatives feel
        as if they too are dead, so deadened are their minds. &quot;Separation
        from my beloved is like death to me!&quot; cries the widow. &quot;My
        life in this world is cursed and worthless!&quot; But she alone
        is approved, who dies, while yet still alive; she lives for the
        sake of the Love of her Beloved.  || 6 ||   So cry out in mourning
        -  you who have come to mourn; this world is false and fraudulent. </p>

      <p> I too have been defrauded, chasing after worldly entanglements;
        my Husband Lord has forsaken me  -  I act like a wife without
        a spouse. In each and every home, are the brides of the Husband
        Lord; they gaze upon their handsome Lord with love and affection.
        I sing the Praises of my True Husband Lord; through the Naam,
        the Name of my Husband Lord, I blossom forth.  || 7 ||   Meeting
        with the Guru, the soul-bride's dress is transformed, and
        she is adorned with Truth. Come and meet with me, O brides of
        the Lord; let's meditate in remembrance on the Creator Lord.
        Through the Naam, the soul-bride becomes the Lord's favorite;
        she is adorned with Truth. Don't sing the songs of separation,
        O Nanak  -  reflect upon God.  || 8 || 3 ||   WADAHANS,  FIRST
        MEHL:  The One who creates and dissolves the world  -  that
        Lord and Master alone knows His creative power. Do not search
        for the True Lord far away; recognize the Word of His Shabad in
        each and every heart. Recognize the True Word of the Shabad, and
        do not think that the Lord is far away; He created this creation.
        Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, peace is obtained;
        without the Naam, it is a losing game. The One who established
        the Universe  -  He alone knows the Way; what can anyone say?
        The One who established the world cast the net over it; accept
        Him as your Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   O Baba, they have come,
        and now they must get up and depart; this world is only a way-station.
        Upon each and every head, the True Lord writes their destiny of
        pain and pleasure, according to their past actions. He bestows
        pain and pleasure, according to the deeds done; the record of
        these actions stays with the soul. They do those deeds which the
        Creator Lord causes them to do; they attempt no other actions.
        The Lord Himself is detached, while the world is entangled in
        conflict; by His Command, He emancipates it. They may put this
        off today, but tomorrow they are seized by death; in love with
        duality, they practice corruption.  || 2 ||   The path of death
        is dark and dismal; the way cannot be seen. There is no water,
        no quilt or mattress, and no food there. There is no food there,
        no honor or water, no clothes or decorations. The chain is put
        around one's neck, and the Messenger of Death standing over
        his head strikes him; he cannot see the door of his home. The
        seeds planted on this path do not sprout; bearing the load of
        sin on his head, he regrets and repents. Without the True Lord,
        no one is his friend; reflect upon this as true.  || 3 ||   O
        Baba, they alone are known to weep and wail, who meet together
        and weep, chanting the Praises of the Lord. Defrauded by Maya
        and worldly affairs, the weepers weep. They weep for the sake
        of worldly affairs, and they do not wash off their own filth;
        the world is a dream. Like the juggler, deceiving by his tricks,
        one is deluded by egotism, falsehood and illusion. The Lord Himself
        reveals the Path; He Himself is the Doer of deeds. Those who are
        imbued with the Naam are protected by the Perfect Guru. O Nanak,
        they merge in celestial bliss.  || 4 || 4 ||   WADAHANS,  FIRST
        MEHL:  O Baba, whoever has come, will rise up and leave; this
        world is a false show. One's true home is obtained by serving
        the True One; real Truth comes by being truthful. By falsehood
        and greed, no place of rest is found, and no place in the world
        hereafter is obtained. No one invites him to come in and sit down
        -  he is like a crow in a deserted house. Caught in birth
        and death, separated from God for such a long time, the whole
        world is wasting away. Greed, worldly entanglements and Maya deceive
        the world. </p>

      <p> Death hovers over its head, and makes it cry.  || 1 ||   Come,
        O Baba, and Siblings of Destiny  -  let's join together;
        take me in your arms, and bless me with your prayers. O Baba,
        union with the True One cannot be broken; bless me with your prayers
        for union with my Beloved. Bless me with your prayers, that I
        may worship God with devotion; for those already united with Him,
        what more is there to unite? Some have wandered away from the
        Name of God  -  they have lost the Path. The Word of the Guru's
        Shabad is the true game. Do not go on the path of Death; remain
        absorbed in the Shabad, the true form throughout the ages. Through
        good fortune, we meet such friends and relatives, who meet with
        the Guru, and escape the noose of Death.  || 2 ||   O Baba, we
        come into the world naked, into pain and pleasure, according to
        the record of our account. The call of our pre-ordained destiny
        cannot be altered; it follows from our past actions. The True
        Lord sits and writes of ambrosial nectar and bitter poison; as
        the Lord attaches us, so are we attached. The charmer, Maya, has
        worked her charms, and the multi-colored thread is around everyone's
        neck. Through shallow intellect, the mind becomes shallow, and
        one eats the fly, along with the sweets. Contrary to custom, he
        comes into the Dark Age of Kali Yuga naked, and naked he is bound
        down and sent away again.  || 3 ||   O Baba, weep and mourn if
        you must; the beloved soul is bound and driven off. The pre-ordained
        record of destiny cannot be erased; the summons has come from
        the Lord's Court. The messenger comes, when it pleases God,
        and the mourners begin to mourn. Sons, brothers, nephews and very
        dear friends weep and wail. Let him weep, who weeps in the Fear
        of God, cherishing the virtues of God  -  no one dies with
        the dead. O Nanak, throughout the ages, they are known as wise,
        who weep, remembering the True One.  || 4 || 5 || </p>

        WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Praise God, the True Lord; He is all-powerful to do all things.
        The soul-bride shall never be a widow; she shall never suffer
        sorrow. She shall never suffer  -  night and day, she enjoys
        pleasures; that soul-bride merges in the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence. She knows her Beloved, the Architect of karma, and she
        speaks words of ambrosial sweetness. The virtuous soul-brides
        dwell on the virtues of God; they keep their Husband Lord in their
        remembrance, and they never suffer separation from Him. So praise
        your True Husband Lord, who is all-powerful to do all things.
        || 1 ||   The True Lord and Master is realized through the Word
        of His Shabad; He blends all with Himself. That soul-bride is
        imbued with the Love of her Husband Lord, who banishes her self-conceit
        from within. Eradicating self-conceit from within, death shall
        not consume her again; as Gurmukh, she knows the One. The desires
        of the soul-bride are fulfilled; deep within, she is drenched
        in His Love. She meets the Great Giver, the Life of the World.
        Imbued with love for the Shabad, she is intoxicated with youth;
        she merges into the very being of her Husband Lord. The True Lord
        and Master is realized through the Word of His Shabad. </p>

      </p>
      <p> He blends all with Himself.  || 2 ||   Those who have realized
        their Husband Lord  -  I go and ask those Saints about Him.
        Renouncing ego, I serve them; thus I meet my True Husband Lord
        with intuitive ease. The True Husband Lord comes to meet the soul-bride
        who practices Truth; she is attuned to the True Word of the Shabad.
        She shall never become a widow; she shall always be a happy bride.
        Deep within her being, she dwells in the celestial bliss of Samaadhi.
        Her Husband Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere; beholding
        Him ever-present, she enjoys His Love with intuitive ease. Those
        who have realized their Husband Lord  -  I go and ask those
        Saints about Him.  || 3 ||   The separated ones also meet with
        their Husband Lord, if they fall at the feet of the True Guru.
        The True Guru is forever merciful; through the Word of His Shabad,
        demerits are burnt away. Burning away her demerits through the
        Shabad, the soul-bride eradicates her love of duality; she is
        attuned to the True, True Lord. Through the True Shabad, everlasting
        peace is obtained, and egotism and doubt are dispelled. The Immaculate
        Husband Lord is forever the Giver of peace; O Nanak, through the
        Word of His Shabad, He is met. The separated ones also meet with
        their Husband Lord, if they fall at the feet of the True Guru.
        || 4 || 1 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  Listen, O brides of the
        Lord: serve your Husband Lord, and contemplate the Word of His
        Shabad. The worthless bride does not know her Husband Lord  - 
        she is deluded; forgetting her Husband Lord, she weeps and wails.
        She weeps, thinking of her Husband Lord, and she constantly cherishes
        His virtues; her Husband Lord does not die, or go away. As Gurmukh,
        she knows Him; through the Word of His Shabad, He is realized.
        Through True Love, she merges with Him. She who does not know
        her Husband Lord, the Architect of karma, is deluded by falsehood
        -  she herself is false. Listen, O brides of the Lord: serve
        your Husband Lord, and contemplate the Word of His Shabad.  ||
        1 ||   He Himself created the whole world; the world comes and
        goes. The love of Maya has ruined the world; people die, to be
        re-born, over and over again. People die to be re-born, over and
        over again, while their sins steadily increase; without spiritual
        wisdom, they are deluded. Without the Shabad, the Husband Lord
        is not found; the worthless, false bride wastes her life away,
        weeping and wailing. He is my Beloved Husband Lord, the Life of
        the World  -  for whom should I weep? They alone weep, who
        forget their Husband Lord. He Himself created the whole world;
        the world comes and goes.  || 2 ||   That Husband Lord is True,
        forever True; He does not die or go away. The ignorant soul-bride
        wanders in delusion; in the love of duality, she sits like a widow.
        She sits like a widow, in the love of duality; infatuated with
        Maya, she suffers in pain. She grows old, and her body withers
        away. Whatever has come, shall all pass away; through the love
        of duality, all suffer in pain. They do not see the Messenger
        of Death; they long for Maya, and their consciousness is attached
        to greed. That Husband Lord is True, forever True; He does not
        die or go away.  || 3 ||   Some weep and wail, separated from
        their Husband Lord; the blind ones do not know that their Husband
        is with them. By Guru's Grace, they meet their True Husband,
        and cherish Him always deep within. She cherishes her Husband
        deep within herself  -  He is always with her, but the self-willed
        manmukhs think that He is far away. This body rolls in the dust,
        and is totally useless; it does not realize the Presence of its
        Lord and Master. </p>

        that they must depart serve the True Guru, and dwell upon the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. They dwell constantly upon the Naam,
        and the True Guru is with them; they serve the True Guru, and
        so obtain peace. Through the Shabad, they kill death, and enshrine
        the True Lord within their hearts; they shall not have to come
        and go again. True is the Lord and Master, and True is His Name;
        His Gracious Glance brings rapture. Those who are separated from
        their Beloved Husband Lord weep and wail, but my True Husband
        Lord is always with me.  || 1 ||   God, my Lord and Master, is
        the highest of all; how can I meet my Dear Beloved? When the True
        Guru united me, then I was naturally united with my Husband Lord,
        and now, I keep Him clasped to my heart. I constantly, lovingly
        cherish my Beloved within my heart; through the True Guru, I see
        my Husband Lord. The cloak of Maya's love is false; wearing
        it, one slips and loses his footing. That cloak is true, which
        is dyed in the color of the Love of my Beloved; wearing it, my
        thirst is quenched. God, my Lord and Master, is the highest of
        all; how can I meet my Dear Beloved?  || 2 ||   I have realized
        my True Lord God, while the other unworthy ones have gone astray.
        I dwell constantly upon my Beloved Husband Lord, and contemplate
        the True Word of the Shabad. The bride contemplates the True Shabad,
        attuned to His Love; she meets with the True Guru, and finds her
        Beloved. Deep within, she is attuned to His Love, intoxicated
        with delight; her enemies and sufferings are all taken away. Surrender
        body and mind to your Guru, and then your mind will be happy;
        your thirst and pain shall be taken away. I have realized my True
        Lord God, while the other unworthy ones have gone astray.  ||
        3 ||   The True Lord Himself created the world; without the Guru,
        there is only pitch darkness. He Himself unites, and causes us
        to unite with Him; He Himself blesses us with His Love. He Himself
        blesses us with His Love, and deals in celestial peace; the life
        of the Gurmukh is redeemed. Blessed is his coming into the world;
        he banishes self-conceit, and is acclaimed as true in the Court
        of the True Lord. The light of the jewel of spiritual wisdom shines
        within his heart, O Nanak, and he loves the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord. The True Lord Himself created the world; without the
        Guru, there is only pitch darkness.  || 4 || 3 ||   WADAHANS,
        THIRD MEHL:  This body is frail; old age is overtaking it. Those
        who are protected by the Guru are saved, while others die, to
        be reincarnated; they continue coming and going. Others die, to
        be reincarnated; they continue coming and going, and in the end,
        they depart with regret. Without the Name, there is no peace.
        According to one's actions here, so are the rewards received;
        the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor. In the City of Death,
        there is pitch darkness and huge clouds of dust; neither sister
        nor brother is there. This body is frail; old age is overtaking
        it.  || 1 || </p>

      <p> The body becomes golden, when one unites with the True Guru. Doubt
        and Maya have been removed from within me, and I am merged in
        the True Name. Merged in the True Name, I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord; meeting my Beloved, I have found peace. I am in constant
        bliss, day and night; egotism has been dispelled from within me.
        I fall at the feet of those persons who enshrine the Naam within
        their consciousness. The body becomes golden, when one unites
        with the True Guru.  || 2 ||   We truly praise the True Lord,
        when the True Guru imparts understanding. Without the True Guru,
        they are deluded by doubt; going to the world hereafter, what
        face will they show? What face will they show, when they go there?
        They will regret and repent for their sins  -  their actions
        will bring them only pain and suffering. Those who are imbued
        with the Naam are dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord's
        Love; they merge into the Being of their Husband Lord. I cannot
        conceive of any other as great as the Lord; unto whom should I
        go and speak? We truly praise the True Lord, when the True Guru
        imparts understanding.  || 3 ||   I fall at the feet of those
        who praise the Truest of the True. Those humble beings are true
        and immaculately pure; meeting them, all filth is washed off.
        Meeting them, all filth is washed off; bathing in the Pool of
        Truth, one becomes truthful, with intuitive ease. The True Guru
        has given me the realization of the Naam, the Name of the immaculate,
        unfathomable, imperceptible Lord. Those who worship the Lord with
        devotion night and day are attuned to His Love; O Nanak, they
        are absorbed in the True Lord. I fall at the feet of those who
        meditate on the Truest of the True.  || 4 || 4 || </p>

        VAAR OF WADAHANS,  FOURTH MEHL:  TO BE SUNG IN THE TUNE OF LALAA-BEHLEEMAA:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The great swan-souls are imbued with the
        Word of the Shabad; they enshrine the True Name within their hearts.
        They gather Truth, remain always in Truth, and love the True Name.
        They are always pure and immaculate  -  filth does not touch
        them; they are blessed with the Grace of the Creator Lord. O Nanak,
        I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Lord night and day.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  I thought that he was a great swan, so
        I associated with him. If I had known that he was only a wretched
        heron from birth, I would not have touched him.  || 2 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  Seeing the swans swimming, the herons wanted to do it too.
        But the poor herons drowned and died, and floated with their heads
        down and their feet up.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  You Yourself are Yourself,
        all by Yourself; You Yourself created the creation. You Yourself
        are Yourself the Formless Lord; there is no other than You. You
        are the all-powerful Cause of causes; whatever You do, comes to
        pass. You give gifts to all beings, without their asking. Everyone
        proclaims, &quot;Waaho! Waaho! Blessed, blessed is the True Guru,
        who has given the supreme gift of the Name of the Lord. </p>

      <p> || 1 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The entire creation is in fear;
        only the Dear Lord is fearless. Serving the True Guru, the Lord
        comes to dwell in the mind, and then, fear can never stay there.
        Enemies and pain cannot come close, and no one can touch you.
        The Gurmukh contemplates God in the mind; whatever pleases God
        comes to pass. O Nanak, He Himself preserves one's honor;
        He alone resolves our affairs.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Some friends
        are leaving, some have already left, and those remaining will
        eventually leave. Those who do not serve the True Guru, come and
        go regretting. O Nanak, those who are attuned to Truth are not
        separated; serving the True Guru, they merge into the Lord.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  Meet with that True Guru, the true friend, within
        whose mind the virtuous Lord abides. Meet with that Beloved True
        Guru, who has subdued egotism from within. Blessed, blessed is
        that Perfect True Guru, who has given the Lord's Teachings
        to reform the whole world. O Saints, meditate constantly on the
        Name of the Lord, and cross over the terrifying, poisonous world-ocean.
        The Perfect Guru has taught me about the Lord; I am forever a
        sacrifice to the Guru.  || 2 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Service
        to the True Guru is the essence of comfort and peace. Doing so,
        one obtains honor here, and the door of salvation in the Court
        of the Lord. So perform the tasks of Truth, wear Truth, and take
        the Support of the True Name. Associating with Truth, obtain Truth,
        and love the True Name. Through the True Word of the Shabad, you
        shall be happy forever, and acclaimed as True in the True Court.
        O Nanak, he alone serves the True Guru, whom the Creator has blessed
        with His Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Cursed is the
        life, and cursed is the dwelling, of those who serve another.
        They abandon the Ambrosial Nectar and turn to poison; they earn
        poison, and poison is their only wealth. Poison is their food,
        and poison is their dress; they fill their mouths with morsels
        of poison. In this world, they earn only pain and suffering, and
        dying, they go to dwell in hell. The self-willed manmukhs have
        filthy faces; they do not know the Word of the Shabad. In sexual
        desire and anger they waste away. They forsake the Fear of the
        True Guru, and because of their stubborn-mindedness, their efforts
        do not succeed. In the City of Death, they are bound and beaten,
        and no one hears their prayers. O Nanak, they act according to
        their pre-ordained destiny; the Gurmukhs abide in the Naam.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  Serve the True Guru, O Holy people; He implants
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within. Worship the True Guru
        day and night; He leads us the meditate on the Lord of the Universe,
        the Master of the Universe. Behold the True Guru, each and every
        moment; He shows us the spiritual path of the Lord. Let everyone
        fall at the feet of the True Guru; He has dispelled the darkness
        of emotional attachment. Let everyone hail and praise the True
        Guru, who has led us to find the treasure of the Lord's devotional
        worship.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Meeting the True Guru,
        hunger departs; hunger does not depart by wearing the robes of
        a beggar. </p>
      <p>

      <p> Afflicted with pain, he wanders from house to house, and in the
        world hereafter, he receives double punishment. Intuitive peace
        does not come to his inner being  -  he is not content to eat
        what comes his way. With his stubborn mind, he begs, and grabs,
        and annoys those who give. Instead of wearing these beggar's
        robes, it is better to be a householder, and give to others. Those
        who are attuned to the Word of the Shabad, acquire understanding;
        the others wander, deluded by doubt. They act according to their
        past actions; it is useless to talk to them. O Nanak, those who
        are pleasing to God are good; He upholds their honor.  || 1 ||
        THIRD MEHL:  Serving the True Guru, one finds a lasting peace;
        the pains of birth and death are removed. He is not troubled by
        anxiety; the carefree Lord comes to dwell in the mind. Deep within,
        is the sacred shrine of spiritual wisdom, revealed by the True
        Guru. Filth is removed, and the mind becomes pure, bathing in
        the sacred shrine, the pool of Ambrosial Nectar. The friend meets
        with the True Friend, the Lord, through the love of the Shabad.
        Within the home of his heart, he finds the Divine Self, and his
        light blends with the Light. The Messenger of Death does not leave
        the hypocrite; he is led away in dishonor. O Nanak, those who
        are attuned to the Naam are saved; they are in love with the True
        Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Go, and sit in the Sat Sangat, the True
        Congregation, where the Name of the Lord is churned. In peace
        and poise, contemplate the Lord's Name  -  don't
        lose the essence of the Lord. Chant the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, constantly, day and night, and you shall be accepted in the
        Court of the Lord. He alone finds the Perfect True Guru, on whose
        forehead such pre-ordained destiny is written. Let everyone bow
        in worship to the Guru, who speaks the sermon of the Lord.  ||
        4 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The friends who love the True Guru,
        meet with the Lord, the True Friend. Meeting their Beloved, they
        meditate on the True Lord with love and affection. Their minds
        are appeased by their own minds, through the incomparable Word
        of the Guru's Shabad. These friends are united, and will
        not be separated again; they have been united by the Creator Lord
        Himself. Some do not believe in the Blessed Vision of the Guru's
        Darshan; they do not contemplate the Word of the Shabad. The separated
        ones are in love with duality  -  what more separation can
        they suffer? Friendship with the self-willed manmukhs lasts for
        only a few short days. This friendship is broken in an instant;
        this friendship leads to corruption. They do not fear the True
        Lord within their hearts, and they do not love the Naam. O Nanak,
        why become friends with those whom the Creator Lord Himself has
        misled?  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Some remain constantly imbued
        with the Love of the One Lord; I am forever a sacrifice to them.
        I dedicate my body, mind and wealth to them; bowing low, I fall
        at their feet. Meeting them, the mind is satisfied, and one's
        hunger and thirst all depart. O Nanak, those who are attuned to
        the Naam are happy forever; they lovingly focus their awareness
        on the True Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  I am a sacrifice to the
        Guru, who recites the sermon of the Lord's Teachings. </p>

      <p> I am forever a sacrifice to that Guru, who has led me to serve
        the Lord. That Beloved True Guru is always with me; wherever I
        may be, He will save me. Most blessed is that Guru, who imparts
        understanding of the Lord. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru,
        who has given me the Lord's Name, and fulfilled the desires
        of my mind.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Consumed by desire,
        the world is burning and dying; burning and burning, it screams.
        But if it meets with the cooling and soothing True Guru, it does
        not burn any longer. O Nanak, without the Name, and without contemplating
        the Word of the Shabad, no one becomes fearless.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  Wearing ceremonial robes, the fire is not quenched, and
        the mind is filled with anxiety. Destroying the snake's hole,
        the snake is not killed; it is just like doing deeds without a
        Guru. Serving the Giver, the True Guru, the Word of the Shabad
        comes to abide in the mind. The mind and body are cooled and soothed;
        peace ensues, and the fire of desire is quenched. The greatest
        comforts and lasting peace are obtained, when one eradicates selfishness
        from within. He alone becomes a detached Gurmukh, who lovingly
        focuses his awareness on the True Lord. Anxiety does not affect
        him at all; he is satisfied and satiated with the Name of the
        Lord. O Nanak, without the Naam, no one is saved; they are utterly
        ruined by egotism.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who meditate on the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, obtain all peace and comforts. Fruitful
        is the entire life of those, who feel hunger for the Name of the
        Lord in their minds. Those who worship and adore the Lord through
        the Guru's Word, forget all their pain and suffering. Those
        Gursikhs are good Saints, who care for nothing other than the
        Lord. Blessed, blessed is their Guru, whose mouth tastes the Ambrosial
        Fruit of the Lord.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  In the Dark
        Age of Kali Yuga, the Messenger of Death is the enemy of life,
        but he acts according to the Lord's Command. Those who are
        protected by the Guru are saved, while the self-willed manmukhs
        receive their punishment. The world is in bondage, under the control
        of the Messenger of Death; no one can hold him back. So serve
        the One who created Death; become Gurmukh, and no pain will touch
        you. O Nanak, Death serves the Gurmukhs; the True Lord abides
        in their minds.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  This body is filled with
        disease; without the Word of the Shabad, the painful disease of
        egotism does not depart. Meeting the True Guru, one becomes immaculately
        pure, and the Lord's Name comes to dwell within the mind.
        O Nanak, meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Peace-Giving
        Lord, one's pains are automatically forgotten.  || 2 || 
        PAUREE:  I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who has taught
        me about God, the Life of the World. I am every bit a sacrifice
        to the Guru, who has spoken the Name of the Lord. I am a sacrifice
        to the Guru, who has totally cured me of the fatal disease of
        egotism. Glorious and great are the virtues of the Guru, who has
        eradicated evil, and instructed me in virtue. </p>

      <p> The True Guru meets with those upon whose foreheads such blessed
        destiny is recorded.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  They alone
        worship the Lord, who remain dead while yet alive; the Gurmukhs
        always worship God. God blesses them with the treasure of devotional
        worship, which no one can take away. They obtain the treasure
        of virtue, the One True Lord, within their minds. O Nanak, the
        Gurmukhs remain united with God; they shall never be separated
        again.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  They do not serve the True Guru;
        how can they contemplate? They do not appreciate the value of
        the Shabad; the fools wander in corruption and poison. The blind
        and the ignorant perform all sorts of ritualistic actions; they
        are in love with duality. Those who take unjustified pride in
        themselves, are punished and humiliated by the Messenger of Death.
        O Nanak, who else is there to ask? God Himself is the Forgiver.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You, O Creator, know all things; all beings
        belong to You. Those who are pleasing to You, You unite with Yourself;
        what can the poor creatures do? You are the all-powerful Cause
        of causes, the True Creator Lord. Those whom You unite, O Beloved,
        are united with You; the Gurmukhs contemplate You. I am a sacrifice
        to my True Guru, who has led me to see my unseen Lord.  || 8 ||
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  He is the Assayer of jewels; He contemplates
        the jewel. The ignorant person is totally blind  -  he does
        not appreciate the value of the jewel. The Jewel is the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad; the Knower alone knows it. The fools take
        pride in themselves, and are ruined in birth and death. O Nanak,
        he alone obtains the jewel, who, as Gurmukh, enshrines love for
        it. Chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, forever and ever  - 
        make the Name of the Lord your daily occupation. If God grants
        His Grace, then He is enshrined within my heart.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  They do not serve the True Guru, and they do not embrace
        love for the Lord's Name. Do not even think that they are
        alive  -  the Creator Lord Himself has killed them. Egotism
        is such a terrible disease; in the love of duality, they do their
        deeds. O Nanak, the self-willed manmukhs are in a living death;
        forgetting the Lord, they suffer in pain.  || 2 ||   PAUREE: 
        Let all bow in reverence, to that humble being whose heart is
        pure within. I am a sacrifice to that humble being whose mind
        is filled with the treasure of the Naam. He has a discriminating
        intellect; he meditates on the Name of the Lord. That True Guru
        is a friend to all; everyone is dear to Him. The Lord, the Supreme
        Soul, is pervading everywhere; reflect upon the wisdom of the
        Guru's Teachings.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Without
        serving the True Guru, the soul is in the bondage of deeds done
        in ego. Without serving the True Guru, one finds no place of rest;
        he dies, and is reincarnated, and continues coming and going. <br>
