      <p> Drinking it in, one becomes immortal and free of desire. The body
        and mind are cooled and soothed, and the fire is extinguished.
        Such a being is the embodiment of bliss, famous throughout the
        world.  || 2 ||   What can I offer You, Lord? Everything belongs
        to You. I am forever a sacrifice to You, hundreds of thousands
        of times. You blessed me, and fashioned my body, mind and soul.
        By Guru's Grace, this lowly being was exalted.  || 3 ||
        Opening the door, You summoned me to the Mansion of Your Presence.
        As You are, so You have revealed Yourself to me. Says Nanak, the
        screen is totally torn away; I am Yours, and You are enshrined
        within my mind.  || 4 || 3 || 14 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        He has linked His servant to His service. The Divine Guru has
        poured the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, into his mouth.
        He has subdued all his anxiety. I am forever a sacrifice to that
        Guru.  || 1 ||   The True Guru has perfectly resolved my affairs.
        The True Guru vibrates the unstruck melody of the sound current.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   His Glory is profound and unfathomable.
        One whom He blesses with patience becomes blissful. One whose
        bonds are shattered by the Sovereign Lord is not cast into the
        womb of reincarnation again.  || 2 ||   One who is illuminated
        by the Lord's radiance within, is not touched by pain and
        sorrow. He holds in his robe the gems and jewels. That humble
        being is saved, along with all his generations.  || 3 ||   He
        has no doubt, double-mindedness or duality at all. He worships
        and adores the One Immaculate Lord alone. Wherever I look, I see
        the Merciful Lord. Says Nanak, I have found God, the source of
        nectar.  || 4 || 4 || 15 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  My self-conceit
        has been eliminated from my body. The Will of God is dear to me.
        Whatever He does, seems sweet to my mind. And then, these eyes
        behold the wondrous Lord.  || 1 ||   Now, I have become wise and
        my demons are gone. My thirst is quenched, and my attachment is
        dispelled. The Perfect Guru has instructed me.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   In His Mercy, the Guru has kept me under His protection.
        The Guru has attached me to the Lord's Feet. When the mind
        is totally held in check, one sees the Guru and the Supreme Lord
        God as one and the same.  || 2 ||   Whoever You have created,
        I am his slave. My God dwells in all. I have no enemies, no adversaries.
        I walk arm in arm, like brothers, with all.  || 3 ||   One whom
        the Guru, the Lord, blesses with peace, does not suffer in pain
        any longer. He Himself cherishes all. Nanak is imbued with the
        love of the Lord of the World.  || 4 || 5 || 16 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  You read the scriptures, and the commentaries, but
        the Perfect Lord does not dwell in your heart. You preach to others
        to have faith, but you do not practice what you preach.  || 1
        ||   O Pandit, O religious scholar, contemplate the Vedas. Eradicate
        anger from your mind, O Pandit.  || 1 ||  Pause  || <br>

      </p>
      <p> You place your stone god before yourself, but your mind wanders
        in the ten directions. You apply a ceremonial tilak mark to its
        forehead, and fall at its feet. You try to appease the people,
        and act blindly.  || 2 ||   You perform the six religious rituals,
        and sit wearing your loin-cloth. In the homes of the wealthy,
        you read the prayer book. You chant on your mala, and beg for
        money. No one has ever been saved in this way, friend.  || 3 ||
        He alone is a Pandit, who lives the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. Maya, of the three qualities, leaves him. The four Vedas
        are completely contained within the Lord's Name. Nanak
        seeks His Sanctuary.  || 4 || 6 || 17 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Millions of troubles do not come near him; the many manifestations
        of Maya are his hand-maidens; countless sins are his water-carriers;
        he is blessed with the Grace of the Creator Lord.  || 1 ||   One
        who has the Lord God as his help and support - all his
        efforts are fulfilled.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is protected by
        the Creator Lord; what harm can anyone do to him? Even an ant
        can conquer the whole world. His glory is endless; how can I describe
        it? I am a sacrifice, a devoted sacrifice, to His feet.  || 2
        ||   He alone performs worship, austerities and meditation; he
        alone is a giver to various charities; he alone is approved in
        this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, whom the Lord Master blesses with
        honor.  || 3 ||   Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, I am enlightened. I have found celestial peace, and my hopes
        are fulfilled. The Perfect True Guru has blessed me with faith.
        Nanak is the slave of His slaves.  || 4 || 7 || 18 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Don't blame others, O people; as you plant,
        so shall you harvest. By your actions, you have bound yourself.
        You come and go, entangled in Maya.  || 1 ||   Such is the understanding
        of the Saintly people. You shall be enlightened, through the Word
        of the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Body, wealth, spouse
        and ostentatious displays are false. Horses and elephants will
        pass away. Power, pleasures and beauty are all false. Without
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, everything is reduced to dust.
        || 2 ||   The egotistical people are deluded by useless doubt.
        Of all this expanse, nothing shall go along with you. Through
        pleasure and pain, the body is growing old. Doing these things,
        the faithless cynics are passing their lives.  || 3 ||   The Name
        of the Lord is Ambrosial Nectar in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
        This treasure is obtained from the Holy. O Nanak, whoever pleases
        the Guru, the Lord of the Universe, beholds the Lord in each and
        every heart.  || 4 || 8 || 19 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, echo the perfect sound current
        of the Naad. The wondrous, amazing unstruck melody vibrates. The
        Saintly people play there with the Lord. They remain totally detached,
        absorbed in the Supreme Lord God.  || 1 ||   It is the realm of
        celestial peace and bliss. The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, sits and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. There is
        no disease or sorrow there, no birth or death.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   There, they meditate only on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        How rare are those who find this place of rest. <br>

      <p> The love of God is their food, and the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praise is their support. They obtain a permanent seat in the infinite.
        || 2 ||   No one falls there, or wavers, or goes anywhere. By
        Guru's Grace, some find this mansion. They are not touched
        by doubt, fear, attachment or the traps of Maya. They enter the
        deepest state of Samaadhi, through the kind mercy of God.  ||
        3 ||   He has no end or limitation. He Himself is unmanifest,
        and He Himself is manifest. One who enjoys the taste of the Lord,
        Har, Har, deep within himself, O Nanak, his wondrous state cannot
        be described.  || 4 || 9 || 20 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meeting
        with the Sangat, the Congregation, the Supreme Lord God has come
        into my consciousness. In the Sangat, my mind has found contentment.
        I touch my forehead to the feet of the Saints. Countless times,
        I humbly bow to the Saints.  || 1 ||   This mind is a sacrifice
        to the Saints; holding tight to their support, I have found peace,
        and in their mercy, they have protected me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        I wash the feet of the Saints, and drink in that water. Gazing
        upon the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan, I live.
        My mind rests its hopes in the Saints. The Saints are my immaculate
        wealth.  || 2 ||   The Saints have covered my faults. By the Grace
        of the Saints, I am no longer tormented. The Merciful Lord has
        blessed me with the Saints' Congregation. The Compassionate
        Saints have become my help and support.  || 3 ||   My consciousness,
        intellect and wisdom have been enlightened. The Lord is profound,
        unfathomable, infinite, the treasure of virtue. He cherishes all
        beings and creatures. Nanak is enraptured, seeing the Saints.
        || 4 || 10 || 21 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Your home, power
        and wealth will be of no use to you. Your corrupt worldly entanglements
        will be of no use to you. Know that all your dear friends are
        fake. Only the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, will go along with
        you.  || 1 ||   Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's
        Name, O friend; remembering the Lord in meditation, your honor
        shall be saved. Remembering the Lord in meditation, the Messenger
        of Death will not touch you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without the
        Lord, all pursuits are useless. Gold, silver and wealth are just
        dust. Chanting the Word of the Guru's Shabad, your mind
        shall be at peace. Here and hereafter, your face shall be radiant
        and bright.  || 2 ||   Even the greatest of the great worked and
        worked until they were exhausted. None of them ever accomplished
        the tasks of Maya. Any humble being who chants the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, will have all his hopes fulfilled.  || 3 ||  
        The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the anchor and support of the
        Lord's devotees. The Saints are victorious in this priceless
        human life. Whatever the Lord's Saint does, is approved
        and accepted. Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to him.  || 4 || 11 ||
        22 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You gather wealth by exploiting
        people. It is of no use to you; it was meant for others. You practice
        egotism, and act like a blind man. In the world hereafter, you
        shall be tied to the leash of the Messenger of Death.  || 1 ||
        Give up your envy of others, you fool! You only live here for
        a night, you fool! You are intoxicated with Maya, but you must
        soon arise and depart. You are totally involved in the dream.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In his childhood, the child is blind. In
        the fullness of youth, he is involved in foul-smelling sins. <br>

      <p> In the third stage of life, he gathers the wealth of Maya. And
        when he grows old, he must leave all this; he departs regretting
        and repenting.  || 2 ||   After a very long time, one obtains
        this precious human body, so difficult to obtain. Without the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, it is reduced to dust. Worse than
        a beast, a demon or an idiot, is that one who does not understand
        who created him.  || 3 ||   Listen, O Creator Lord, Lord of the
        Universe, Lord of the World, Merciful to the meek, forever compassionate
        - If You emancipate the human, then his bonds are broken.
        O Nanak, the people of world are blind; please, Lord, forgive
        them, and unite them with Yourself.  || 4 || 12 || 23 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Joining the elements together, the robe of the body
        is fashioned. The ignorant fool is engrossed in it. He cherishes
        it, and constantly takes care of it. But at the very last moment,
        he must arise and depart.  || 1 ||   Without the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, everything is false, O mortal. Those who do not vibrate
        and meditate on the Lord of the Universe, but instead are imbued
        with other things, - all those mortals are plundered by
        Maya.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage,
        filth is not washed off. Religious rituals are all just egotistical
        displays. By pleasing and appeasing people, no one is saved. Without
        the Naam, they shall depart weeping.  || 2 ||   Without the Lord's
        Name, the screen is not torn away. I have studied all the Shaastras
        and Simritees. He alone chants the Naam, whom the Lord Himself
        inspires to chant. He obtains all fruits and rewards, and merges
        in peace.  || 3 ||   O Savior Lord, please save me! All peace
        and comforts are in Your Hand, God. Whatever you attach me to,
        to that I am attached, O my Lord and Master. O Nanak, the Lord
        is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.  || 4 || 13 || 24
        ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Whatever He does makes me happy.
        The ignorant mind is encouraged, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy. Now, it does not waver at all; it has become stable
        and steady. Receiving Truth, it is merged in the True Lord.  ||
        1 ||   Pain is gone, and all illness is gone. I have accepted
        the Will of God in my mind, associating with the Great Person,
        the Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All is pure; all is immaculate.
        Whatever exists is good. Wherever He keeps me, that is the place
        of liberation for me. Whatever He makes me chant, is His Name.
        || 2 ||   That is the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage,
        where the Holy place their feet, and that is heaven, where the
        Naam is chanted. All bliss comes, when one obtains the Blessed
        Vision of the Lord's Darshan. I sing continuously, continually,
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 3 ||   The Lord Himself
        is pervading in each and every heart. The glory of the Merciful
        Lord is radiant and manifest. The shutters are opened, and doubts
        have run away. Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru.  || 4 || 14
        || 25 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Millions of meditations and
        austerities rest in him, along with wealth, wisdom, miraculous
        spiritual powers and angelic spiritual insight. He enjoys the
        various shows and forms, pleasures and delicacies; the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, dwells within the heart of the Gurmukh.  ||
        1 ||   Such is the glorious greatness of the Name of the Lord.
        Its value cannot be described.  || 1 ||  Pause  || <br>

      <p> He alone is brave, patient and perfectly wise; he is intuitively
        in Samaadhi, profound and unfathomable. He is liberated forever
        and all his affairs are perfectly resolved; the Lord's
        Name abides within his heart.  || 2 ||   He is totally peaceful,
        blissful and healthy; he looks upon all impartially, and is perfectly
        detached. He does not come and go, and he never wavers; the Naam
        abides in his mind.  || 3 ||   God is Merciful to the meek; He
        is the Lord of the World, the Lord of the Universe. The Gurmukh
        meditates on Him, and his worries are gone. The Guru has blessed
        Nanak with the Naam; he serves the Saints, and works for the Saints.
        || 4 || 15 || 26 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Sing the Kirtan
        of the Lord's Praises, and the Beej Mantra, the Seed Mantra.
        Even the homeless find a home in the world hereafter. Fall at
        the feet of the Perfect Guru; you have slept for so many incarnations
        - wake up!  || 1 ||   Chant the Chant of the Lord's
        Name, Har, Har. By Guru's Grace, it shall be enshrined
        within your heart, and you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate on the eternal treasure of the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mind, and then, the screen of Maya
        shall be torn away. Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Guru's
        Shabad, and then your soul shall be rendered immaculate and pure.
        || 2 ||   Searching, searching, searching, I have realized that
        without devotional worship of the Lord, no one is saved. So vibrate,
        and meditate on that Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy; your mind and body shall be imbued with love for the
        Lord.  || 3 ||   Renounce all your cleverness and trickery. O
        mind, without the Lord's Name, there is no place of rest.
        The Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the World, has taken pity
        on me. Nanak seeks the protection and support of the Lord, Har,
        Har.  || 4 || 16 || 27 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the Saints'
        Congregation, play joyfully with the Lord, and you will not have
        to meet the Messenger of Death hereafter. Your egotistical intellect
        shall be dispelled, and your evil-mindedness will be totally taken
        away.  || 1 ||   Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's
        Name, O Pandit. Religious rituals and egotism are of no use at
        all. You shall go home with happiness, O Pandit.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I have earned the profit, the wealth of the Lord's
        praise. All my hopes have been fulfilled. Pain has left me, and
        peace has come to my home. By the Grace of the Saints, my heart-lotus
        blossoms forth.  || 2 ||   One who is blessed with the gift of
        the jewel of the Name, obtains all treasures. His mind becomes
        content, finding the Perfect Lord. Why should he ever go begging
        again?  || 3 ||   Hearing the Lord's sermon, he becomes
        pure and holy. Chanting it with his tongue, he finds the way to
        salvation. He alone is approved, who enshrines the Lord within
        his heart. Nanak: such a humble being is exalted, O Siblings of
        Destiny.  || 4 || 17 || 28 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  No matter
        how hard you try to grab it, it does not come into your hands.
        No matter how much you may love it, it does not go along with
        you. Says Nanak, when you abandon it, then it comes and falls
        at your feet.  || 1 ||   Listen, O Saints: this is the pure philosophy.
        Without the Lord's Name, there is no salvation. Meeting
        with the Perfect Guru, one is saved.  || 1 || <br>

      <p> Pause  ||   When someone tries to appease her, then she takes
        pride in herself. But when someone puts her out of his thoughts,
        then she serves him like a slave.  || 2 ||   She seems to please,
        but in the end, she deceives. She does not remain in any one place.
        She has bewitched a great many worlds. The Lord's humble
        servants cut her apart into pieces.  || 3 ||   Whoever begs from
        her remains hungry. Whoever is infatuated with her obtains nothing.
        But one who renounces her, and joins the Society of the Saints,

        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  See the Lord, the Universal Soul, in
        all. The One God is perfect, and all-pervading. Know that the
        priceless jewel is within your own heart. Realize that your essence
        is within your own self.  || 1 ||   Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar,
        by the Grace of the Saints. One who is blessed with high destiny,
        obtains it. Without a tongue, how can one know the taste?  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   How can a deaf person listen to the eighteen
        Puraanas and the Vedas? The blind man cannot see even a million
        lights. The beast loves grass, and remains attached to it. One
        who has not been taught - how can he understand?  || 2
        ||   God, the Knower, knows all. He is with His devotees, through
        and through. Those who sing God's Praises with joy and
        delight, O Nanak - the Messenger of Death does not even
        approach them.  || 3 || 19 || 30 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Blessing me with His Name, He has purified and sanctified me.
        The Lord's wealth is my capital. False hope has left me;
        this is my wealth. Breaking my bonds, the Lord has linked me to
        His service. I am a devotee of the Lord, Har, Har; I sing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||   The unstruck sound current
        vibrates and resounds. The Lord's humble servants sing
        His Glorious Praises with love and delight; they are honored by
        the Divine Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My pre-ordained destiny
        has been activated; I have awakened from the sleep of countless
        incarnations. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, my
        aversion is gone. My mind and body are imbued with love for the
        Lord.  || 2 ||   The Merciful Savior Lord has saved me. I have
        no service or work to my credit. In His Mercy, God has taken pity
        on me; He lifted me up and pulled me out, when I was suffering
        in pain.  || 3 ||   Listening, listening to His Praises, joy has
        welled up within my mind. Twenty-four hours a day, I sing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord. Singing, singing His Praises, I
        have obtained the supreme status. By Guru's Grace, Nanak
        is lovingly focused on the Lord.  || 4 || 20 || 31 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  In exchange for a shell, he gives up a jewel. He
        tries to get what he must give up. He collects those things which
        are worthless. Enticed by Maya, he takes the crooked path.  ||
        1 ||   You unfortunate man - have you no shame? You do
        not remember in your mind the ocean of peace, the perfect Transcendent
        Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Nectar seems bitter to you, and
        poison is sweet. Such is your condition, you faithless cynic,
        which I have seen with my own eyes. You are fond of falsehood,
        fraud and egotism. <br>

      </p>
      <p> If you hear the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you feel like you
        have been stung by a scorpion.  || 2 ||   You continually yearn
        for Maya, and you never chant the Lord's Praises with your
        mouth. The Lord is fearless and formless; He is the Great Giver.
        But you do not love Him, you fool!  || 3 ||   God, the True King,
        is above the heads of all kings. He is the independent, perfect
        Lord King. People are intoxicated by emotional attachment, entangled
        in doubt and family life. Nanak: they are saved only by Your Mercy,
        Lord.  || 4 || 21 || 32 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Night and
        day, I chant the Lord's Name. Hereafter, I shall obtain
        a seat in the Court of the Lord. I am in bliss forever; I have
        no sorrow. The disease of ego never afflicts me.  || 1 ||   O
        Saints of the Lord, seek out those who know God. You shall be
        wonderstruck with wonder at the wonderful Lord; meditate in remembrance
        on the Lord, O mortal, and obtain the supreme status.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Calculating, measuring, and thinking in every way,
        see that without the Naam, no one can be carried across. Of all
        your efforts, none will go along with you. You can cross over
        the terrifying world-ocean only through the love of God.  || 2
        ||   By merely washing the body, one's filth is not removed.
        Afflicted by egotism, duality only increases. That humble being
        who takes the medicine of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har -
        all his diseases are eradicated.  || 3 ||   Take pity on me, O
        merciful, Supreme Lord God; let me never forget the Lord of the
        World from my mind. Let me be the dust of the feet of Your slaves;
        O God, please fulfill Nanak's hope.  || 4 || 22 || 33 ||
        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are my Protection, O perfect Divine
        Guru. There is no other than You. You are all-powerful, O perfect
        Supreme Lord God. He alone meditates on You, whose karma is perfect.
        || 1 ||   You Name, God, is the boat to carry us across. My mind
        has grasped Your protection alone. Other than You, I have no place
        of rest at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Chanting, meditating on
        Your Name, I live, and hereafter, I will obtain a seat in the
        Court of the Lord. Pain and darkness are gone from my mind; my
        evil-mindedness is dispelled, and I am absorbed in the Lord's
        Name.  || 2 ||   I have enshrined love for the Lord's lotus
        feet. The lifestyle of the Perfect Guru is immaculate and pure.
        My fear has run away, and the fearless Lord dwells within my mind.
        My tongue continually chants the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the
        Lord.  || 3 ||   The nooses of millions of incarnations are cut
        away. I have obtained the profit of the true wealth. This treasure
        is inexhaustible; it will never run out. O Nanak, the devotees
        look beautiful in the Court of the Lord.  || 4 || 23 || 34 ||
        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is
        a jewel, a ruby. It brings Truth, contentment and spiritual wisdom.
        The Lord entrusts the treasures of peace, intuition and kindness
        to His devotees.  || 1 ||   This is the treasure of my Lord. Consuming
        and expending it, it is never used up. The Lord has no end or
        limitation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praise is a priceless diamond. It is the ocean of bliss and virtue.
        In the Word of the Guru's Bani is the wealth of the unstruck
        sound current. The Saints hold the key to it in their hands. <br>

      <p> || 2 ||   They sit there, in the cave of deep Samaadhi; the unique,
        perfect Lord God dwells there. God holds conversations with His
        devotees. There is no pleasure or pain, no birth or death there.
        || 3 ||   One whom the Lord Himself blesses with His Mercy, obtains
        the Lord's wealth in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy. Nanak prays to the merciful Primal Lord; the Lord is my
        merchandise, and the Lord is my capital.  || 4 || 24 || 35 ||
        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Vedas do not know His greatness.
        Brahma does not know His mystery. Incarnated beings do not know
        His limit. The Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God, is infinite.
        || 1 ||   Only He Himself knows His own state. Others speak of
        Him only by hearsay.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Shiva does not know
        His mystery. The gods gave grown weary of searching for Him. The
        goddesses do not know His mystery. Above all is the unseen, Supreme
        Lord God.  || 2 ||   The Creator Lord plays His own plays. He
        Himself separates, and He Himself unites. Some wander around,
        while others are linked to His devotional worship. By His actions,
        He makes Himself known.  || 3 ||   Listen to the true story of
        the Saints. They speak only of what they see with their eyes.
        He is not involved with virtue or vice. Nanak's God is
        Himself all-in-all.  || 4 || 25 || 36 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        I have not tried to do anything through knowledge. I have no
        knowledge, intelligence or spiritual wisdom. I have not practiced
        chanting, deep meditation, humility or righteousness. I know nothing
        of such good karma.  || 1 ||   O my Beloved God, my Lord and Master,
        there is none other than You. Even though I wander and make mistakes,
        I am still Yours, God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have no wealth,
        no intelligence, no miraculous spiritual powers; I am not enlightened.
        I dwell in the village of corruption and sickness. O my One Creator
        Lord God, Your Name is the support of my mind.  || 2 ||   Hearing,
        hearing Your Name, I live; this is my mind's consolation.
        Your Name, God, is the Destroyer of sins. You, O Limitless Lord,
        are the Giver of the soul. He alone knows You, unto whom You reveal
        Yourself.  || 3 ||   Whoever has been created, rests his hopes
        in You. All worship and adore You, God, O treasure of excellence.
        Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to You. My merciful Lord and Master
        is infinite.  || 4 || 26 || 37 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        Savior Lord is merciful. Millions of incarnations are eradicated
        in an instant, contemplating the Lord. All beings worship and
        adore Him. Receiving the Guru's Mantra, one meets God.
        || 1 ||   My God is the Giver of souls. The Perfect Transcendent
        Lord Master, my God, imbues each and every heart.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   My mind has grasped His Support. My bonds have been shattered.
        Within my heart, I meditate on the Lord, the embodiment of supreme
        bliss. My mind is filled with ecstasy.  || 2 ||   The Lord's
        Sanctuary is the boat to carry us across. <br>

      <p> The Lord's Feet are the embodiment of life itself. They
        are the Support of the breath of life of the Saints. God is infinite,
        the highest of the high.  || 3 ||   That mind is excellent and
        sublime, which meditates in remembrance on the Lord. In His Mercy,
        the Lord Himself bestows it. Peace, intuitive poise and bliss
        are found in the Lord's Name. Meeting with the Guru, Nanak
        chants the Name.  || 4 || 27 || 38 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Abandon all your clever tricks. Become His servant, and serve
        Him. Totally erase your self-conceit. You shall obtain the fruits
        of your mind's desires.  || 1 ||   Be awake and aware with
        your Guru. Your hopes and desires shall be fulfilled, and you
        shall obtain all treasures from the Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Let no one think that God and Guru are separate. The True Guru
        is the Immaculate Lord. Do not believe that He is a mere human
        being; He gives honor to the dishonored.  || 2 ||   Hold tight
        to the Support of the Guru, the Lord. Give up all other hopes.
        Ask for the treasure of the Name of the Lord, and then you shall
        be honored in the Court of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Chant the Mantra
        of the Guru's Word. This is the essence of true devotional
        worship. When the True Guru becomes merciful, slave Nanak is enraptured.
        || 4 || 28 || 39 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Whatever happens,
        accept that as good. Leave your egotistical pride behind. Day
        and night, continually sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        This is the perfect purpose of human life.  || 1 ||   Meditate
        on the Lord, O Saints, and be in bliss. Renounce your cleverness
        and all your tricks. Chant the Immaculate Chant of the Guru's
        Mantra.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Place the hopes of your mind in
        the One Lord. Chant the Immaculate Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        Bow down to the Guru's Feet, and cross over the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 2 ||   The Lord God is the Great Giver. He has
        no end or limitation. All treasures are in His home. He will be
        your Saving Grace in the end.  || 3 ||   Nanak has obtained this
        treasure, the immaculate Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Whoever chants
        it, is emancipated. It is obtained only by  His Grace.  || 4 ||
        29 || 40 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Make this invaluable human
        life fruitful. You shall not be destroyed when you go to the Lord's
        Court. In this world and the next, you shall obtain honor and
        glory. At the very last moment, He will save you.  || 1 ||   Sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. In both this world and the next,
        you shall be embellished with beauty, meditating on the wondrous
        Primal Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   While standing up and sitting
        down, meditate on the Lord, and all your troubles shall depart.
        All your enemies will become friends. Your consciousness shall
        be immaculate and pure.  || 2 ||   This is the most exalted deed.
        Of all faiths, this is the most sublime and excellent faith. Meditating
        in remembrance on the Lord, you shall be saved. You shall be rid
        of the burden of countless incarnations.  || 3 ||   Your hopes
        shall be fulfilled, and the noose of the Messenger of Death will
        be cut away. So listen to the Guru's Teachings. <br>

      <p> O Nanak, you shall be absorbed in celestial peace.  || 4 || 30
        || 41 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Honor the One, to whom everything
        belongs. Leave your egotistical pride behind. You belong to Him;
        everyone belongs to Him. Worship and adore Him, and you shall
        be at peace forever.  || 1 ||   Why do you wander in doubt, you
        fool? Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, nothing is of any
        use at all. Crying out, 'Mine, mine', a great many
        have departed, regretfully repenting.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever
        the Lord has done, accept that as good. Without accepting, you
        shall mingle with dust. His Will seems sweet to me. By Guru's
        Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind.  || 2 ||   He Himself is
        carefree and independent, imperceptible. Twenty-four hours a day,
        O mind, meditate on Him. When He comes into the consciousness,
        pain is dispelled. Here and hereafter, your face shall be radiant
        and bright.  || 3 ||   Who, and how many have been saved, singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord? They cannot be counted or evaluated.
        Even the sinking iron is saved, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, O Nanak, as His Grace is received.  || 4 || 31 ||
        42 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  In your mind, meditate on the
        Lord God. This is the Teaching given by the Perfect Guru. All
        fears and terrors are taken away, and your hopes shall be fulfilled.
        || 1 ||   Service to the Divine Guru is fruitful and rewarding.
        His value cannot be described; the True Lord is unseen and mysterious.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself is the Doer, the Cause of causes.
        Meditate on Him forever, O my mind, and continually serve Him.
        You shall be blessed with truth, intuition and peace, O my friend.
        || 2 ||   My Lord and Master is so very great. In an instant,
        He establishes and disestablishes. There is no other than Him.
        He is the Saving Grace of His humble servant.  || 3 ||   Please
        take pity on me, and hear my prayer, that Your servant may behold
        the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. Nanak chants the Chant of
        the Lord, whose glory and radiance are the highest of all.  ||
        4 || 32 || 43 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Reliance on mortal
        man is useless. O God, my Lord and Master, You are my only Support.
        I have discarded all other hopes. I have met with my carefree
        Lord and Master, the treasure of virtue.  || 1 ||   Meditate on
        the Name of the Lord alone, O my mind. Your affairs shall be perfectly
        resolved; sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har,
        O my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are the Doer, the Cause of
        causes. Your lotus feet, Lord, are my Sanctuary. I meditate on
        the Lord in my mind and body. The blissful Lord has revealed His
        form to me.  || 2 ||   I seek His eternal support; He is the Creator
        of all beings. Remembering the Lord in meditation, the treasure
        is obtained. At the very last instant, He shall be your Savior.
        || 3 ||   Be the dust of all men's feet. Eradicate self-conceit,
        and merge in the Lord. Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord. O Nanak, this is the most rewarding activity.
        || 4 || 33 || 44 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He is the Doer,
        the Cause of causes, the bountiful Lord. The merciful Lord cherishes
        all. The Lord is unseen and infinite. <br>

      <p> God is great and endless.  || 1 ||   I humbly pray to invoke the
        Universal Lord God, the Lord of the World. The Creator Lord is
        all-pervading, everywhere.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is the Lord
        of the Universe, the Life of the World. Within your heart, worship
        and adore the Destroyer of fear. The Master Rishi of the senses,
        Lord of the World, Lord of the Universe. He is perfect, ever-present
        everywhere, the Liberator.  || 2 ||   You are the One and only
        merciful Master, spiritual teacher, prophet, religious teacher.
        Master of hearts, Dispenser of justice, more sacred than the Koran
        and the Bible.  || 3 ||   The Lord is powerful and merciful. The
        all-pervading Lord is the support of each and every heart. The
        luminous Lord dwells everywhere. His play cannot be known.  ||
        4 ||   Be kind and compassionate to me, O Creator Lord. Bless
        me with devotion and meditation, O Lord Creator. Says Nanak, the
        Guru has rid me of doubt. The Muslim God Allah and the Hindu God
        Paarbrahm are one and the same.  || 5 || 34 || 45 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The sinful residues of millions of incarnations
        are eradicated. Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, pain will not
        afflict you. When the Lord's lotus feet are enshrined in
        the mind, all terrible evils are taken away from the body.  ||
        1 ||   Sing the Praise of the Lord of the World, O mortal being.
        The Unspoken Speech of the True Lord God is perfect. Dwelling
        upon it, one's light merges into the Light.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Hunger and thirst are totally quenched; by the Grace of
        the Saints, meditate on the immortal Lord. Night and day, serve
        God. This is the sign that one has met with the Lord.  || 2 ||
        Worldly entanglements are ended, when God becomes merciful.
        Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I
        am enraptured. My perfect pre-destined karma has been activated.
        With my tongue, I continually sing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord.  || 3 ||   The Saints of the Lord are accepted and approved
        forever. The foreheads of the Saintly people are marked with the
        Lord's insignia. One who is blessed with the dust of the
        feet of the Lord's slave, O Nanak, obtains the supreme
        status.  || 4 || 35 || 46 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Let yourself
        be a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
        Focus your heart's meditation on the Lord's lotus
        feet. Apply the dust of the feet of the Saints to your forehead,
        and the filthy evil-mindedness of countless incarnations will
        be washed off.  || 1 ||   Meeting Him, egotistical pride is eradicated,
        and you will come to see the Supreme Lord God in all. The Perfect
        Lord God has showered His Mercy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This is
        the Guru's Praise, to chant the Name of the Lord. This
        is devotion to the Guru, to sing forever the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord. This is contemplation upon the Guru, to know that
        the Lord is close at hand. Accept the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad as Truth.  || 2 ||   Through the Word of the Guru's
        Teachings, look upon pleasure and pain as one and the same. Hunger
        and thirst shall never afflict you. The mind becomes content and
        satisfied through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Meditate
        on the Lord of the Universe, and He will cover all your faults.
        || 3 ||   The Guru is the Supreme Lord God; the Guru is the Lord
        of the Universe. The Guru is the Great Giver, merciful and forgiving.
        One whose mind is attached to the Guru's feet, O slave
        Nanak, is blessed with perfect destiny. || 4 || 36 || 47 || <br>
