      <p> I wandered around lost for a year, but no one touched my soul.
        I listened to preachers and teachers, but I could not be happy
        with their lifestyles. Those who have abandoned the Lord's
        Name, and become attached to duality - why should I speak
        in praise of them? So speaks Bhikhaa: the Lord has led me to meet
        the Guru. As You keep me, I remain; as You protect me, I survive.
        || 2 || 20 ||   Wearing the armor of Samaadhi, the Guru has mounted
        the saddled horse of spiritual wisdom. Holding the bow of Dharma
        in His Hands, He has shot the arrows of devotion and humility.
        He is fearless in the Fear of the Eternal Lord God; He has thrust
        the spear of the Word of the Guru's Shabad into the mind.
        He has cut down the five demons of unfulfilled sexual desire,
        unresolved anger, unsatisfied greed, emotional attachment and
        self-conceit. Guru Amar Daas, the son of Tayj Bhaan, of the noble
        Bhalla dynasty, blessed by Guru Nanak, is the Master of kings.
        Sall speaks the truth; O Guru Amar Daas, you have conquered the
        army of evil, fighting the battle this way.  || 1 || 21 ||   The
        raindrops of the clouds, the plants of the earth, and the flowers
        of the spring cannot be counted. Who can know the limits of the
        rays of the sun and the moon, the waves of the ocean and the Ganges?
        With Shiva's meditation and the spiritual wisdom of the
        True Guru, says Bhall the poet, these may be counted. O Guru Amar
        Daas, Your Glorious Virtues are so sublime; Your Praises belong
        only to You.  || 1 || 22 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Meditate single-mindedly on the Immaculate
        Primal Lord God. By Guru's Grace, sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord forever. Singing His Praises, the mind blossoms forth
        in ecstasy. The True Guru fulfills the hopes of His humble servant.
        Serving the True Guru, the supreme status is obtained. Meditate
        on the Imperishable, Formless Lord God. Meeting with Him, one
        escapes poverty. Kalsahaar chants His Glorious Praises. I chant
        the pure praises of that humble being who has been blessed with
        the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He served
        the True Guru and was blessed with the sublime essence of the
        Shabad, the Word of God. The Immaculate Naam has been enshrined
        in his heart. He enjoys and savors the Lord's Name, and
        purchases the Glorious Virtues of the Lord of the Universe. He
        seeks the essence of reality; he is the Fountain of even-handed
        justice. So speaks Kal the poet: Guru Raam Daas, the son of Har
        Daas, fills the empty pools to overflowing.  || 1 ||   The stream
        of ambrosial nectar flows and the immortal status is obtained;
        the pool is forever overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar. Those Saints
        who have served the Lord in the past drink in this Nectar, and
        bathe their minds in it. God takes their fears away, and blesses
        them with the state of fearless dignity. Through the Word of His
        Shabad, He has saved them. So speaks Kal the poet: Guru Raam Daas,
        the son of Har Daas, fills the empty pools to overflowing.  ||
        2 ||   The True Guru's understanding is deep and profound.
        The Sat Sangat is His Pure Congregation. His Soul is drenched
        in the deep crimson color of the Lord's Love. The Lotus
        of His mind remains awake and aware, illuminated with intuitive
        wisdom. In His own home, He has obtained the Fearless, Immaculate
        Lord. <br>

      <p> The Merciful True Guru has implanted the Lord's Name within
        me, and by His Grace, I have overpowered the five thieves. So
        speaks Kal the poet: Guru Raam Daas, the son of Har Daas, fills
        the empty pools to overflowing.  || 3 ||   With intuitive detachment,
        He is lovingly attuned to the Fearless, Unmanifest Lord; He met
        with Guru Amar Daas, the Philosopher's Stone, within his
        own home. By the Grace of the True Guru, He attained the supreme
        status; He is overflowing with the treasures of loving devotion.
        He was released from reincarnation, and the fear of death was
        taken away. His consciousness is attached to the Lord, the Ocean
        of contentment. So speaks Kal the poet: Guru Raam Daas, the son
        of Har Daas, fills the empty pools to overflowing.  || 4 ||  
        He fills the empty to overflowing; He has enshrined the Infinite
        within His heart. Within His mind, He contemplates the essence
        of reality. the Destroyer of pain, the Enlightener of the soul.
        He yearns for the Lord's Love forever; He Himself knows
        the sublime essence of this Love. By the Grace of the True Guru,
        He intuitively enjoys this Love. By the Grace of Guru Nanak, and
        the sublime teachings of Guru Angad, Guru Amar Daas broadcast
        the Lord's Command. So speaks Kal: O Guru Raam Daas, You
        have attained the status of eternal and imperishable dignity.
        || 5 ||   You abide in the pool of contentment; Your tongue reveals
        the Ambrosial Essence. Meeting with You, a tranquil peace wells
        up, and sins run far away. You have attained the Ocean of peace,
        and You never grow tired on the Lord's path. The armor
        of self-restraint, truth, contentment and humility can never be
        pierced. The Creator Lord certified the True Guru, and now the
        world blows the trumpet of His Praises. So speaks Kal: O Guru
        Raam Daas, You have attained the state of fearless immortality.
        || 6 ||   O certified True Guru, You have conquered the world;
        You meditate single-mindedly on the One Lord. Blessed, blessed
        is Guru Amar Daas, the True Guru, who implanted the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, deep within. The Naam is the wealth of the nine
        treasures; prosperity and supernatural spiritual powers are His
        slaves. He is blessed with the ocean of intuitive wisdom; He has
        met with the Imperishable Lord God. The Guru has implanted the
        Naam deep within; attached to the Naam, the devotees have been
        carried across since ancient times. So speaks Kal: O Guru Raam
        Daas, You have obtained the wealth of the Lord's Love.
        || 7 ||   The flow of loving devotion and primal love does not
        stop. The True Guru drinks in the stream of nectar, the sublime
        essence of the Shabad, the Infinite Word of God. Wisdom is His
        mother, and contentment is His father; He is absorbed in the ocean
        of intuitive peace and poise. The Guru is the Embodiment of the
        Unborn, Self-illumined Lord; by the Word of His Teachings, the
        Guru carries the world across. Within His mind, the Guru has enshrined
        the Shabad, the Word of the Unseen, Unfathomable, Infinite Lord.
        So speaks Kal: O Guru Raam Daas, You have attained the Lord, the
        Saving Grace of the world.  || 8 ||   The Saving Grace of the
        world, the nine treasures, carries the devotees across the world-ocean.
        The Drop of Ambrosial Nectar, the Lord's Name, is the antidote
        to the poison of sin. The tree of intuitive peace and poise blossoms
        and bears the ambrosial fruit of spiritual wisdom. Blessed are
        those fortunate people who receive it, by Guru's Grace.
        They are liberated through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru;
        their minds are filled with the Guru's Wisdom. <br>

      </p>
      <p> So speaks Kal: O Guru Raam Daas, You beat the drum of the Shabad.
        || 9 ||   On the bed of faith, with the blankets of intuitive
        peace and poise and the canopy of contentment, You are embellished
        forever with the armor of humility. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, you practice the Naam; You lean on its Support, and give
        Your Fragrance to Your companions. You abide with the Unborn Lord,
        the Good and Pure True Guru. So speaks Kal: O Guru Raam Daas,
        You abide in the sacred pool of intuitive peace and poise.  ||
        10 ||   The Lord's Name abides in the hearts of those who
        are pleasing to the Guru. Sins run far away from those who are
        pleasing to the Guru. Those who are pleasing to the Guru eradicate
        pride and egotism from within. Those who are pleasing to the Guru
        are attached to the Shadad, the Word of God; they are carried
        across the terrifying world-ocean. Those who are blessed with
        the wisdom of the certified Guru - blessed and fruitful
        is their birth into the world. Kal the poet runs to the Sanctuary
        of the Great Guru; attached to the Guru, they are blessed with
        worldly enjoyments, liberation and everything.  || 11 ||   The
        Guru has pitched the tent; under it, all the ages are gathered.
        He carries the spear of intuition, and takes the Support of Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, through which the devotees are fulfilled.
        Guru Nanak, Guru Angad and Guru Amar Daas, through devotional
        worship, have merged into the Lord. O Guru Raam Daas, You alone
        know the taste of this Raja Yoga.  || 12 ||   He alone is enlightened
        like Janaka, who links the chariot of his mind to the state of
        ecstatic realization. He gathers in truth and contentment, and
        fills up the empty pool within. He speaks the Unspoken Speech
        of the eternal city. He alone obtains it, unto whom God gives
        it. O Guru Raam Daas, Your sovereign rule, like that of Janak,
        is Yours alone.  || 13 ||   Tell me, how can sin and suffering
        cling to that humble being who chants the Naam, given by the Guru,
        with single-minded love and firm faith? When the Lord, the Boat
        to carry us across, bestows His Glance of Grace, even for an instant,
        the mortal contemplates the Shabad within his heart; unfulfilled
        sexual desire and unresolved anger are eradicated. The Guru is
        the Giver to all beings; He speaks the spiritual wisdom of the
        Unfathomable Lord, and meditates on Him day and night. He never
        sleeps, even for an instant. Seeing Him, poverty vanishes, and
        one is blessed with the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord. The spiritual wisdom of the Guru's Word washes away
        the filth of evil-mindedness. Tell me, how can sin and suffering
        cling to that humble being who chants the Naam, given by the Guru,
        with single-minded love and firm faith?  || 1 ||   Dharmic faith
        and the karma of good deeds are obtained from the Perfect True
        Guru. The Siddhas and Holy Saadhus, the silent sages and angelic
        beings, yearn to serve Him; through the most excellent Word of
        the Shabad, they are lovingly attuned to the One Lord. Who can
        know Your limits? You are the Embodiment of the Fearless, Formless
        Lord. You are the Speaker of the Unspoken Speech; You alone understand
        this. O foolish worldly mortal, you are deluded by doubt; give
        up birth and death, and you shall not be punished by the Messenger
        of Death. Meditate on the Guru's Teachings. You foolish
        mortal being, reflect on this in your mind; chant and meditate
        day and night. Dharmic faith and the karma of good deeds are obtained
        from the Perfect True Guru.  || 2 ||   I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice,
        to the True Name, O my True Guru. What Praises can I offer to
        You? What service can I do for You? I have only one mouth and
        tongue; with my palms pressed together, I chant to You with joy
        and delight. <br>

      <p> In thought, word and deed, I know the Lord; I do not worship any
        other. The Guru has enshrined the most excellent Name of the Infinite
        Lord within my heart. So speaks Nall the poet: touching the Philosopher's
        Stone, glass is transformed into gold, and the sandalwood tree
        imparts its fragrance to other trees; meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord, I am transformed. Seeing His Door, I am rid of sexual
        desire and anger. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, to the True Name,
        O my True Guru.  || 3 ||   Guru Raam Daas was blessed with the
        Throne of Raja Yoga. First, Guru Nanak illuminated the world,
        like the full moon, and filled it with bliss. To carry humanity
        across, He bestowed His Radiance. He blessed Guru Angad with the
        treasure of spiritual wisdom, and the Unspoken Speech; He overcame
        the five demons and the fear of the Messenger of Death. The Great
        and True Guru, Guru Amar Daas, has preserved honor in this Dark
        Age of Kali Yuga. Seeing His Lotus Feet, sin and evil are destroyed.
        When His mind was totally satisfied in every way, when He was
        totally pleased, He bestowed upon Guru Raam Daas the Throne of
        Raja Yoga.  || 4 ||   RADD:  He established the earth, the sky
        and the air, the water of the oceans, fire and food. He created
        the moon, the starts and the sun, night and day and mountains;
        he blessed the trees with flowers and fruits. He created the gods,
        human beings and the seven seas; He established the three worlds.
        Guru Amar Daas was blessed with the Light of the One Name, the
        True Name of the Lord.  || 1 || 5 ||   Glass is transformed into
        gold, listening to the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Poison
        is transformed into ambrosial nectar, speaking the Name of the
        True Guru. Iron is transformed into jewels, when the True Guru
        bestows His Glance of Grace. Stones are transformed into emeralds,
        when the mortal chants and contemplates the spiritual wisdom of
        the Guru. The True Guru transforms ordinary wood into sandalwood,
        eradicating the pains of poverty. Whoever touches the Feet of
        the True Guru, is transformed from a beast and a ghost into an
        angelic being.  || 2 || 6 ||   One who has the Guru on his side
        - how could he be proud of his wealth? One who has the
        Guru on his side - what would hundreds of thousands of
        supporters do for him? One who has the Guru on his side, does
        not depend on anyone else for spiritual wisdom and meditation.
        One who has the Guru on his side contemplates the Shabad and the
        Teachings, and abides in the Home of Truth. The Lord's
        humble slave and poet utters this prayer: whoever chants to the
        Guru night and day, whoever enshrines the Name of the Guru within
        his heart, is rid of both birth and death.  || 3 || 7 ||   Without
        the Guru, there is utter darkness; without the Guru, understanding
        does not come. Without the Guru, there is no intuitive awareness
        or success; without the Guru, there is no liberation. So make
        Him your Guru, and contemplate the Truth; make Him your Guru,
        O my mind. Make Him your Guru, who is embellished and exalted
        in the Word of the Shabad; all your sins shall be washed away.
        So speaks Nall the poet: with your eyes, make Him your Guru; with
        the words you speak, make Him your Guru, your True Guru. Those
        who have not seen the Guru, who have not made Him their Guru,
        are useless in this world.  || 4 || 8 ||   Dwell upon the Guru,
        the Guru, the Guru, O my mind. <br>

      <p> The All-powerful Guru is the Boat to carry us across in this Dark
        Age of Kali Yuga. Hearing the Word of His Shabad, we are transported
        into Samaadhi. He is the Spiritual Hero who destroys pain and
        brings peace. Whoever meditates on Him, dwells near Him. He is
        the Perfect Primal Being, who meditates in remembrance on the
        Lord within his heart; seeing His Face, sins run away. If you
        long for wisdom, wealth, spiritual perfection and properity, O
        my mind, dwell upon the Guru, the Guru, the Guru.  || 5 || 9 ||
        Gazing upon the Face of the Guru, I find peace. I was thirsty,
        yearning to drink in the Nectar; to fulfill that wish, the Guru
        laid out the way. My mind has become perfect; it dwells in the
        Lord's Place; it had been wandering in all directions,
        in its desire for tastes and pleasures. Goindwal is the City of
        God, built on the bank of the Beas River. The pains of so many
        years have been taken away; gazing upon the Face of the Guru,
        I find peace.  || 6 || 10 ||   The All-powerful Guru placed His
        hand upon my head. The Guru was kind, and blessed me with the
        Lord's Name. Gazing upon His Feet, my sins were dispelled.
        Night and day, the Guru meditates on the One Lord; hearing His
        Name, the Messenger of Death is scared away. So speaks the Lord's
        slave: Guru Raam Daas placed His Faith in Guru Amar Daas, the
        Guru of the World; touching the Philosopher's Stone, He
        was transformed into the Philosopher's Stone. Guru Raam
        Daas recognized the Lord as True; the All-powerful Guru placed
        His hand upon His head.  || 7 || 11 ||   Now, please preserve
        the honor of Your humble slave. God saved the honor of the devotee
        Prahlaad, when Harnaakhash tore him apart with his claws. And
        the Dear Lord God saved the honor of Dropadi; when her clothes
        were stripped from her, she was blessed with even more. Sudaamaa
        was saved from misfortune; and Ganikaa the prostitute -
        when she chanted Your Name, her affairs were perfectly resolved.
        O Great True Guru, if it pleases You, please save the honor of
        Your slave in this Dark Age of kali Yuga.  || 8 || 12 ||   JHOLNAA:
        Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O mortal beings. Chant the
        Shabad, the Word of the Lord, Har, Har; the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, brings the nine treasures. With your tongue, taste it,
        day and night, and know it as true. Then, you shall obtain His
        Love and Affection; become Gurmukh, and meditate on Him. Give
        up all other ways; vibrate and meditate on Him, O spiritual people.
        Enshrine the Word of the Guru's Teachings within your heart,
        and overpower the five passions. Your life, and your generations,
        shall be saved, and you shall be honored at the Lord's
        Door. If you desire all the peace and comforts of this world and
        the next, then chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O mortal beings.
        || 1 || 13 ||   Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, and know
        Him as true. Know that the Lord is the Treasure of Excellence.
        Enshrine Him in your mind, and meditate on Him. Enshrine the Word
        of the Guru's Teachings within your heart. Then, cleanse
        yourself in the Immaculate and Unfathomable Water of the Guru;
        O Gursikhs and Saints, cross over the Ocean of Love of the True
        Name. Meditate lovingly forever on the Lord, free of hate and
        vengeance, Formless and Fearless; lovingly savor the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, and implant devotional worship of the Lord
        deep within. O foolish mind, give up your doubts; as Gurmukh,
        vibrate and meditate on the Naam. <br>

      <p> Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, and know Him as true.  ||
        2 || 14 ||   Chant Guru, Guru, Guru; through the Guru, the Lord
        is obtained. The Guru is an Ocean, deep and profound, infinite
        and unfathomable. Lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name,
        you shall be blessed with jewels, diamonds and emeralds. And,
        the Guru makes us fragrant and fruitful, and His Touch transforms
        us into gold. The filth of evil-mindedness is washed away, meditating
        on the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The Stream of Ambrosial
        Nectar flows constantly from His Door. The Saints and Sikhs bathe
        in the immaculate pool of the Guru's spiritual wisdom.
        Enshrine the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your heart, and
        dwell in Nirvaanaa. Chant Guru, Guru, Guru; through the Guru,
        the Lord is obtained.  || 3 || 15 ||   Chant Guru, Guru, Guru,
        Guru, Guru, O my mind. Serving Him, Shiva and the Siddhas, the
        angels and demons and servants of the gods, and the thrity-three
        million gods cross over, listening to the Word of the Guru's
        Teachings. And, the Saints and loving devotees are carried across,
        chanting Guru, Guru. Prahlaad and the silent sages met the Guru,
        and were carried across. Naarad and Sanak and those men of God
        who became Gurmukh were carried across; attached to the One Name,
        they abandoned other tastes and pleasures, and were carried across.
        This is the prayer of the Lord's humble slave: the Gurmukh
        obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord, chanting Guru, Guru, Guru,
        Guru, Guru, O my mind.  || 4 || 16 || 29 ||   The Great, Supreme
        Guru showered His Mercy upon all; in the Golden Age of Sat Yuga,
        He blessed Dhroo. He saved the devotee Prahlaad, placing the Lotus
        of His Hand upon his forehead. The Unseen Form of the Lord cannot
        be seen. The Siddhas and seekers all seek His Sanctuary. True
        are the Words of the Guru's teachings. Enshrine them in
        your soul. Emancipate your body, and redeem this human incarnation.
        The Guru is the Boat, and the Guru is the Boatman. Without the
        Guru, no one can cross over. By Guru's Grace, God is obtained.
        Without the Guru, no one is liberated. Guru Nanak dwells near
        the Creator Lord. He established Lehnaa as Guru, and enshrined
        His Light in the world. Lehnaa established the path of righteousness
        and Dharma, which He passed on to Guru Amar Daas, of the Bhalla
        dynasty. Then, He firmly established the Great Raam Daas of the
        Sodhi dynasty. He was blessed with the inexhaustible treasure
        of the Lord's Name. He was blessed with the treasure of
        the Lord's Name; throughout the four ages, it is inexhaustible.
        Serving the Guru, He received His reward. Those who bow at His
        Feet and seek His Sanctuary, are blessed with peace; those Gurmukhs
        are blessed with supreme bliss. The Guru's Body is the
        Embodiment of the Supreme Lord God, our Lord and Master, the Form
        of the Primal Being, who nourishes and cherishes all. So serve
        the Guru, the True Guru; His ways and means are inscrutable. The
        Great Guru Raam Daas is the Boat to carry us across.  || 1 ||
        The Holy people chant the Ambrosial Words of His Bani with delight
        in their minds. The Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan
        is fruitful and rewarding in this world; it brings lasting bliss
        and joy. The Guru's Darshan is fruitful and rewarding in
        this world, like the Ganges. Meeting Him, the supreme sacred status
        is obtained. Even sinful people conquer the realm of Death, if
        they become the Lord's humble servants, and are imbued
        with the Guru's spiritual wisdom. He is certified, like
        the handsome Ram Chander in the house of Dasrath of the Raghwa
        dynasty. <br>

      <p> Even the silent sages seek His Sanctuary. So serve the Guru, the
        True Guru; His ways and means are inscrutable. The Great Guru
        Raam Daas is the Boat to carry us across.  || 2 ||   The Name
        of the Lord, from the Mouth of the Guru, is the Raft to cross
        over the unfathomable world-ocean. The cycle of birth and death
        in this world is ended for those who have this faith in their
        hearts. Those humble beings who have this faith in their hearts,
        are awarded the highest status. They forsake Maya, emotional attachment
        and greed; they are rid of the frustrations of possessiveness,
        sexual desire and anger. They are blessed with the Inner Vision
        to see God, the Cause of causes, and all their doubts are dispelled.
        So serve the Guru, the True Guru; His ways and means are inscrutable.
        The Great Guru Raam Daas is the Boat to carry us across.  || 3
        ||   The Glorious Greatness of the Guru is manifest forever in
        each and every heart. His humble servants sing His Praises. Some
        read and listen and sing of Him, taking their cleansing bath in
        the early hours of the morning before the dawn. After their cleansing
        bath in the hours before the dawn, they worship the Guru with
        their minds pure and clear. Touching the Philosopher's
        Stone, their bodies are transformed into gold. They focus their
        meditation on the Embodiment of Divine Light. So serve the Guru,
        the True Guru; His ways and means are inscrutable. The Great Guru
        Raam Daas is the Boat to carry us across.  || 4 ||   Those who
        realize the Eternal, Unchanging Word of God, like Dhroo, are immune
        to death. They cross over the terrifying world-ocean in an instant;
        the Lord created the world like a bubble of water. The Kundalini
        rises in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; through the Word
        of the Guru, they enjoy the Lord of Supreme Bliss. The Supreme
        Guru is the Lord and Master over all; so serve the True Guru,
        in thought, word and deed.  || 5 ||   Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru,
        Waahay Guru, Waahay Jee-o. You are lotus-eyed, with sweet speech,
        exalted and embellished with millions of companions. Mother Yashoda
        invited You as Krishna to eat the sweet rice. Gazing upon Your
        supremely beautiful form, and hearing the musical sounds of Your
        silver bells tinkling, she was intoxicated with delight. Death's
        pen and command are in Your hands. Tell me, who can erase it?
        Shiva and Brahma yearn to enshrine Your spiritual wisdom in their
        hearts. You are forever True, the Home of Excellence, the Primal
        Supreme Being. Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay Jee-o.
        || 1 || 6 ||   You are blessed with the Lord's Name, the
        supreme mansion, and clear understanding. You are the Formless,
        Infinite Lord; who can compare to You? For the sake of the pure-hearted
        devotee Prahlaad, You took the form of the man-lion, to tear apart
        and destroy Harnaakhash with your claws. You are the Infinite
        Supreme Lord God; with your symbols of power, You deceived Baliraja;
        who can know You? You are forever True, the Home of Excellence,
        the Primal Supreme Being. Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru,
        Waahay Jee-o.  || 2 || 7 ||   As Krishna, You wear yellow robes,
        with teeth like jasmine flowers; You dwell with Your lovers, with
        Your mala around Your neck, and You joyfully adorn Your head with
        the crow of peacock feathers. <br>

      <p> You have no advisors, You are so very patient; You are the Upholder
        of the Dharma, unseen and unfathomable. You have staged the play
        of the Universe with joy and delight. No one can speak Your Unspoken
        Speech. You are pervading the three worlds. You assume the form
        of spiritual perfection, O King of kings. You are forever True,

        Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay Jee-o.  || 3 || 8 ||   The True
        Guru, the True Guru, the True Guru is the Lord of the Universe
        Himself. Enticer of Baliraja, who smothers the mighty, and fulfills
        the devotees; the Prince Krishna, and Kalki; the thunder of His
        army and the beat of His drum echoes across the Universe. The
        Lord of contemplation, Destroyer of sin, who brings pleasure to
        the beings of all realms, He Himself is the God of gods, Divinity
        of the divine, the thousand-headed king cobra. He took birth in
        the Incarnations of the Fish, Tortoise and Wild Boar, and played
        His part. He played games on the banks of the Jamunaa River. Enshrine
        this most excellent Name within your heart, and renounce the wickedness
        of the mind, O Gayand. the True Guru, the True Guru, the True
        Guru is the Lord of the Universe Himself.  || 4 || 9 ||   The
        Supreme Guru, the Supreme Guru, the Supreme Guru, the True, Dear
        Lord. Respect and obey the Guru's Word; this is your own
        personal treasure  -  know this mantra as true. Night and
        day, you shall be saved, and blessed with the supreme status.
        Renounce sexual desire, anger, greed and attachment; give up your
        games of deception. Snap the noose of egotism, and let yourself
        be at home in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Free
        your consciousness of attachment to your body, your home, your
        spouse, and the pleasures of this world. Serve forever at His
        Lotus Feet, and firmly implant these teachings within. Enshrine
        this most excellent Name within your heart, and renounce the wickedness
        of the mind, O Gayand. the Supreme Guru, the Supreme Guru, the
        Supreme Guru, the True, Dear Lord.  || 5 || 10 ||   Your servants
        are totally fulfilled, throughout the ages; O Waahay Guru, it
        is all You, forever. O Formless Lord God, You are eternally intact;
        no one can say how You came into being. You created countless
        Brahmas and Vishnus; their minds were intoxicated with emotional
        attachment. You created the 8.4 million species of beings, and
        provide for their sustanance. Your servants are totally fulfilled,
        throughout the ages; O Waahay Guru, it is all You, forever.  ||
        1 || 11 ||   Waaho! Waaho! Great! Great is the Play of God! He
        Himself laughs, and He Himself thinks; He Himself illumines the
        sun and the moon. He Himself is the water, He Himself is the earth
        and its support. He Himself abides in each and every heart. He
        Himself is male, and He Himself is female; He Himself is the chessman,
        and He Himself is the board. As Gurmukh, join the Sangat, and
        consider all this: Waaho! Waaho! Great! Great is the Play of God!
        || 2 || 12 ||   You have formed and created this play, this great
        game. O Waahay Guru, this is all You, forever. You are pervading
        and permeating the water, land, skies and nether regions; Your
        Words are sweeter than Ambrosial Nectar. <br>

      <p> Brahmas and Shivas respect and obey You. O Death of death, Formless
        Lord, I beg of You. By Guru's Grace, the greatest thing
        is obtained, and the mind is involved with the Sat Sangat, the
        True Congregation. You have formed and created this play, this
        great game. O Waahay Guru, this is all Your making.  || 3 || 13
        || 42 ||   The Lord is Inaccessible, Infinite, Eternal and Primordial;
        no one knows His beginning. Shiva and Brahma meditate on Him;
        the Vedas describe Him again and again. The Lord is Formless,
        beyond hate and vengeance; there is no one else like Him. He creates
        and destroys  -  He is All-powerful; God is the Boat to
        carry all across. He created the world in its various aspects;
        His humble servant Mat'huraa delights in His Praises. Sat
        Naam, the Great and Supreme True Name of God, the Personification
        of Creativity, dwells in the Consciousness of Guru Raam Daas.
        || 1 ||   I have grasped hold of the All-powerful Guru; He has
        made my mind steady and stable, and embellished me with clear
        consciousness. And, His Banner of Righteousness waves proudly
        forever, to defend against the waves of sin. His humble servant
        Mat'huraa knows this as true, and speaks it from his soul;
        there is nothing else to consider. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,
        the Lord's Name is the Great Ship, to carry us all across
        the terrifying world-ocean, safely to the other side.  || 2 ||
        The Saints dwell in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;
        imbued with pure celestial love, they sing the Lord's Praises.
        The Support of the Earth has established this Path of Dharma;
        He Himself remains lovingly attuned to the Lord, and does not
        wander in distraction. So speaks Mat'huraa: those blessed
        with good fortune receive the fruits of their minds' desires.
        Those who focus their consciousness on the Guru's Feet
        -  why should they fear death?  || 3 ||   The Immaculate,
        Sacred Pool of the Guru is overflowing with the waves of the Shabad,
        radiantly revealed in the early hours before the dawn. He is Deep
        and Profound, Unfathomable and utterly Great, eternally overflowing
        with all sorts of jewels. The Saint-swans celebrate; their fear
        of death is erased, along with the accounts of their pain. In
        this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the residues of sins are taken away;
        the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan is the Ocean of
        all peace and comfort.  || 4 ||   For His Sake, the silent sages
        meditated and focused their consciousness, wandering all the ages
        through; rarely, if ever, their souls were enlightened. In the
        Hymns of the Vedas, Brahma sang His Praises; for His Sake, Shiva
        the silent sage held his place on the Kailaash Mountain. For His
        Sake, the Yogis, celibates, Siddhas and seekers, the countless
        sects of fanatics with matted hair wear religious robes, wandering
        as detached renunciates. That True Guru, by the Pleasure of His
        Will, showered His Mercy upon all beings, and blessed Guru Raam
        Daas with the Glorious Greatness of the Naam.  || 5 ||   He focuses
        His Meditation deep within; the Embodiment of Light, He illuminates
        the three worlds. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan,
        doubt runs away, pain is eradicated, and celestial peace spontaneously
        wells up. The selfless servants and Sikhs are always totally captivated
        by it, like bumble bees lured by the fragrance of the flower.
        The Guru Himself established the Eternal Throne of Truth, in Guru
        Raam Daas. <br>

        it has been saved; the All-powerful Guru has blessed it with the
        Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam. And, the Praiseworthy Guru is blessed
        with eternal peace, wealth and prosperity; the supernatural spiritual
        powers of the Siddhis never leave him. His Gifts are vast and
        great; His awesome Power is supreme. Your humble servant and slave
        speaks this truth. One, upon whose head the Guru has placed His
        Hand  -  with whom should he be concerned?  || 7 || 49
        ||   He is totally pervading and permeating the three realms;
        in all the world, He has not created another like Himself. He
        Himself created Himself. The angels, human beings and demons have
        not found His limits. The angels, demons and human beings have
        not found His limits; the heavenly heralds and celestial singers
        wander around, searching for Him. The Eternal, Imperishable, Unmoving

        the Infinity of the Infinite, the Eternal All-powerful Cause of
        causes  -  all beings meditate on Him in their minds. O
        Great and Supreme Guru Raam Daas, Your Victory resounds across
        the universe. You have attained the supreme status of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   Nanak, the True Guru, worships God single-mindedly;
        He surrenders His body, mind and wealth to the Lord of the Universe.
        The Infinite Lord enshrined His Own Image in Guru Angad. In His
        heart, He delights in the spiritual wisdom of the Unfathomable
        Lord. Guru Amar Daas brought the Creator Lord under His control.
        Waaho! Waaho! Meditate on Him! O Great and Supreme Guru Raam Daas,
        Your Victory resounds across the universe. You have attained the
        supreme status of the Lord.  || 2 ||   Naarad, Dhroo, Prahlaad
        and Sudaamaa are accounted among the Lord's devotees of
        the past. Ambreek, Jai Dayv, Trilochan, Naam Dayv and Kabeer are
        also remembered. They were incarnated in this Dark Age of Kali
        Yuga; their praises have spread over all the world. O Great and
        Supreme Guru Raam Daas, Your Victory resounds across the universe.
        You have attained the supreme status of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Those
        who meditate in remembrance on You within their minds  -
        their sexual desire and anger are taken away. Those who remember
        You in meditation with their words, are rid of their poverty and
        pain in an instant. Those who obtain the Blessed Vision of Your
        Darshan, by the karma of their good deeds, touch the Philosopher's
        Stone, and like Ball the poet, sing Your Praises. O Great and
        Supreme Guru Raam Daas, Your Victory resounds across the universe.
        You have attained the supreme status of the Lord.  || 4 ||   Those
        who meditate in remembrance on the True Guru  -  the darkness
        of their eyes is removed in an instant. Those who meditate in
        remembrance on the True Guru within their hearts, are blessed
        with the Lord's Name, day by day. Those who meditate in
        remembrance on the True Guru within their souls - the fire
        of desire is extinguished for them. Those who meditate in remembrance
        on the True Guru, are blessed with wealth and prosperity, supernatural
        spiritual powers and the nine treasures. So speaks Ball the poet:
        Blessed is Guru Raam Daas; joining the Sangat, the Congregation,
        call Him blessed and great.  || 5 || 54 ||   Living the Word of
        the Shabad, He attained the supreme status; while performing selfless
        service, He did not leave the side of Guru Amar Daas. <br>

      <p> From that service, the light from the jewel of spiritual wisdom
        shines forth, radiant and bright; it has destroyed pain, poverty
        and darkness. So speaks Keerat the poet: those who grasp hold
        of the feet of the Saints, are not afraid of death, sexual desire
        or anger. Just as Guru Nanak was part and parcel, life and limb
        with Guru Angad, so is Guru Amar Daas one with Guru Raam Daas.
        || 1 ||   Whoever serves the True Guru obtains the treasure;
        night and day, he dwells at the Lord's Feet. And so, the
        entire Sangat loves, fears and respects You. You are the sandalwood
        tree; Your fragrance spreads gloriously far and wide. Dhroo, Prahlaad,
        Kabeer and Trilochan chanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and
        His Illumination radiantly shines forth. Seeing Him, the mind
        is totally delighted; Guru Raam Daas is the Helper and Support
        of the Saints.  || 2 ||   Guru Nanak realized the Immaculate Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. He was lovingly attuned to loving devotional
        worship of the Lord. Gur Angad was with Him, life and limb, like
        the ocean; He showered His consciousness with the Word of the
        Shabad. The Unspoken Speech of Guru Amar Daas cannot be expressed
        with only one tongue. Guru Raam Daas of the Sodhi dynasty has
        now been blessed with Glorious Greatness, to carry the whole world
        across.  || 3 ||   I am overflowing with sins and demerits; I
        have no merits or virtues at all. I abandoned the Ambrosial Nectar,
        and I drank poison instead. I am attached to Maya, and deluded
        by doubt; I have fallen in love with my children and spouse. I
        have heard that the most exalted Path of all is the Sangat, the
        Guru's Congregation. Joining it, the fear of death is taken
        away. Keerat the poet offers this one prayer: O Guru Raam Daas,
        save me! Take me into Your Sanctuary!  || 4 || 58 ||   He has
        crushed and overpowered emotional attachment. He seized sexual
        desire by the hair, and threw it down. With His Power, He cut
        anger into pieces, and sent greed away in disgrace. Life and death,
        with palms pressed together, respect and obey the Hukam of His
        Command. He brought the terrifying world-ocean under His Control;
        by His Pleasure, He carried His Sikhs across. He is seated upon
        the Throne of Truth, with the canopy above His Head; He is embellished
        with the powers of Yoga and the enjoyment of pleasures. So speaks
        Sall the poet: O Guru Raam Daas, Your sovereign power is eternal
        and unbreakable; Your army is invincible.  || 1 ||   You are the
        True Guru, throughout the four ages; You Yourself are the Transcendent
        Lord. The angelic beings, seekers, Siddhas and Sikhs have served
        You, since the very beginning of time. You are the Primal Lord
        God, from the very beginning, and throughout the ages; Your Power
        supports the three worlds. You are Inaccessible; You are the Saving
        Grace of the Vedas. You have conquered old age and death. Guru
        Amar Daas has permanently established You; You are the Emancipator,
        to carry all across to the other side. So speaks Sall the poet:
        O Guru Raam Daas, You are the Destroyer of sins; I seek Your Sanctuary.
