      <p> <font color="#000000">If it is in his karma, then he finds the True
        Guru; without such karma, He cannot be found. He meets the True
        Guru, and he is transformed into gold, if it is the Lord's
        Will.  || 1 ||   O my mind, focus your consciousness on the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har. The Lord is found through the True Guru,
        and then he remains merged with the True Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Spiritual wisdom wells up through the True Guru, and then
        this cynicism is dispelled. Through the True Guru, the Lord is
        realized, and then, he is not consigned to the womb of reincarnation
        ever again.  || 2 ||   By Guru's Grace, the mortal dies
        in life, and by so dying, lives to practice the Word of the Shabad.
        He alone finds the Door of Salvation, who eradicates self-conceit
        from within himself.  || 3 ||   By Guru's Grace, the mortal
        is reincarnated into the Home of the Lord, having eradicated Maya
        from within. He eats the uneatable, and is blessed with a discriminating
        intellect; he meets the Supreme Person, the Primal Lord God. 
        || 4 ||   The world is unconscious, like a passing show; the mortal
        departs, having lost his capital. The profit of the Lord is obtained
        in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; by good karma, it is
        found.  || 5 ||   Without the True Guru, no one finds it; see
        this in your mind, and consider this in your heart. By great good
        fortune, the mortal finds the Guru, and crosses over the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 6 ||   The Name of the Lord is my Anchor and
        Support. I take only the Support of the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har. O Dear Lord, please be kind and lead me to meet the Guru,
        that I may find the Door of Salvation.  || 7 ||   The pre-ordained
        destiny inscribed on the mortal's forehead by our Lord
        and Master cannot be erased. O Nanak, those humble beings are
        perfect, who are pleased by the Lord's Will.  || 8 || 1
        ||   MALAAR,  THIRD MEHL:  The world is involved with the words
        of the Vedas, thinking about the three gunas - the three
        dispositions. Without the Name, it suffers punishment by the Messenger
        of Death; it comes and goes in reincarnation, over and over again.
        Meeting with the True Guru, the world is liberated, and finds
        the Door of Salvation.  || 1 ||   O mortal, immerse yourself in
        service to the True Guru. By great good fortune, the mortal finds
        the Perfect Guru, and meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord, by the Pleasure of His Own
        Will, created the Universe, and the Lord Himself gives it sustenance
        and support. The Lord, by His Own Will, makes the mortal's
        mind immaculate, and lovingly attunes him to the Lord. The Lord,
        by His Own Will, leads the mortal to meet the True Guru, the Embellisher
        of all his lives.  || 2 ||   Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is
        the True Word of His Bani. Only a few, as Gurmukh, understand.
        Waaho! Waaho! Praise God as Great! No one else is as Great as
        He. When God's Grace is received, He Himself forgives the
        mortal, and unites him with Himself.  || 3 ||   The True Guru
        has revealed our True, Supreme Lord and Master. The Ambrosial
        Nectar rains down and the mind is satisfied, remaining lovingly
        attuned to the True Lord. <br>

      <p> In the Lord's Name, it is forever rejuvenated; it shall
        never wither and dry up again.  || 4 ||   Without the True Guru,
        no one finds the Lord; anyone can try and see. By the Lord's
        Grace, the True Guru is found, and then the Lord is met with intuitive
        ease. The self-willed manmukh is deluded by doubt; without good
        destiny, the Lord's wealth is not obtained.  || 5 ||  
        The three dispositions are completely distracting; people read
        and study and contemplate them. Those people are never liberated;
        they do not find the Door of Salvation. Without the True Guru,
        they are never released from bondage; they do not embrace love
        for the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 6 ||   The Pandits, the
        religious scholars, and the silent sages, reading and studying
        the Vedas, have grown weary. They do not even think of the Lord's
        Name; they do not dwell in the home of their own inner being.
        The Messenger of Death hovers over their heads; they are ruined
        by the deceit within themselves.  || 7 ||   Everyone longs for
        the Name of the Lord; without good destiny, it is not obtained.
        When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, the mortal meets the
        True Guru, and the Lord's Name comes to dwell within the
        mind. O Nanak, through the Name, honor wells up, and the mortal
        remains immersed in the Lord.  || 8 || 2 || <br>

        the mortal to work for the Guru. His pains are taken away, and
        the Lord's Name comes to dwell within. True deliverance
        comes by focusing one's consciousness on the True Lord.
        Listen to the Shabad, and the Word of the Guru's Bani.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, serve the Lord, Har, Har, the true treasure.
        By Guru's Grace, the wealth of the Lord is obtained. Night
        and day, focus your meditation on the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The soul-bride who adorns herself without her Husband Lord,
        is ill-mannered and vile, wasted away into ruin. This is the useless
        way of life of the self-willed manmukh. Forgetting the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, he performs all sorts of empty rituals.  ||
        2 ||   The bride who is Gurmukh is beautifully embellished. Through
        the Word of the Shabad, she enshrines her Husband Lord within
        her heart. She realizes the One Lord, and subdues her ego. That
        soul-bride is virtuous and noble.  || 3 ||   Without the Guru,
        the Giver, no one finds the Lord. The greedy self-willed manmukh
        is attracted and engrossed in duality. Only a few spiritual teachers
        realize this, that without meeting the Guru, liberation is not
        obtained.  || 4 ||   Everyone tells the stories told by others.
        Without subduing the mind, devotional worship does not come. When
        the intellect achieves spiritual wisdom, the heart-lotus blossoms
        forth. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to abide in that
        heart.  || 5 ||   In egotism, everyone can pretend to worship
        God with devotion. But this does not soften the mind, and it does
        not bring peace. By speaking and preaching, the mortal only shows
        off his self-conceit. His devotional worship is useless, and his
        life is a total waste.  || 6 ||   They alone are devotees, who
        are pleasing to the Mind of the True Guru. Night and day, they
        remain lovingly attuned to the Name. <br>

      <p> They behold the Naam, the Name of the Lord, ever-present, near
        at hand. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is pervading
        and permeating everywhere.  || 7 ||   God Himself forgives, and
        bestows His Love. The world is suffering from the terrible disease
        of egotism. By Guru's Grace, this disease is cured. O Nanak,
        through the Truth, the mortal remains immersed in the True Lord.

        worship. His humble servants are imbued with His Love. He is imbued
        with His servants, day and night; He does not forget them from
        His Mind, even for an instant. He is the Lord of the World, the
        Treasure of virtue; He is always with me. All glorious virtues
        belong to the Lord of the Universe. With His Feet, He has fascinated
        my mind; as His humble servant, I am intoxicated with love for
        His Name. O Nanak, my Beloved is forever Merciful; out of millions,
        hardly anyone realizes Him.  || 1 ||   O Beloved, Your state is
        inaccessible and infinite. You save even the worst sinners. He
        is the Purifier of sinners, the Lover of His devotees, the Ocean
        of mercy, our Lord and Master. In the Society of the Saints, vibrate
        and meditate on Him with commitment forever; He is the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts. Those who wander in reincarnation through
        millions of births, are saved and carried across, by meditating
        in remembrance on the Naam. Nanak is thirsty for the Blessed Vision
        of Your Darshan, O Dear Lord; please take care of him.  || 2 ||
        My mind is absorbed in the Lotus Feet of the Lord. O God, You
        are the water; Your humble servants are fish. O Dear God, You
        alone are the water and the fish. I know that there is no difference
        between the two. Please take hold of my arm and bless me with
        Your Name. I am honored only by Your Grace. In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, vibrate and meditate with love on the
        One Lord of the Universe, who is Merciful to the meek. Nanak,
        the lowly and helpless, seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord, who in
        His Kindness has made him His Own.  || 3 ||   He unites us with
        Himself. Our Sovereign Lord King is the Destroyer of fear. My
        Wondrous Lord and Master is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of
        hearts. My Beloved, the Treasure of virtue, has met me. Supreme
        happiness and peace well up, as I cherish the Glorious Virtues
        of the Lord of the Universe. Meeting with Him, I am embellished
        and exalted; gazing on Him, I am fascinated, and I realize my
        pre-ordained destiny. Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those
        who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4 || 1 || <br>

        Everything becomes green and lush; the pools and ponds are filled
        to overflowing. The inner self is imbued with the deep crimson
        color of love for the True Lord. The heart-lotus blossoms forth

      <p> The self-willed manmukh is on the wrong side. You can see this
        with your own eyes. He is caught in the trap like the deer; the
        Messenger of Death hovers over his head. Hunger, thirst and slander
        are evil; sexual desire and anger are horrible. These cannot be
        seen with your eyes, until you contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
        Whoever is pleasing to You is content; all his entanglements are
        gone. Serving the Guru, his capital is preserved. The Guru is
        the ladder and the boat. O Nanak, whoever is attached to the Lord
        receives the essence; O True Lord, You are found when the mind
        is true.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  There is one path and one door.
        The Guru is the ladder to reach one's own place. Our Lord
        and Master is so beautiful, O Nanak; all comfort and peace are
        in the Name of the True Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself created
        Himself; He Himself understands Himself. Separating the sky and
        the earth, He has spread out His canopy. Without any pillars,
        He supports the sky, through the insignia of His Shabad. Creating
        the sun and the moon, He infused His Light into them. He created
        the night and the day; Wondrous are His miraculous plays. He created
        the sacred shrines of pilgrimage, where people contemplate righteousness
        and Dharma, and take cleansing baths on special occasions. There
        is no other equal to You; how can we speak and describe You? You
        are seated on the throne of Truth; all others come and go in reincarnation.
        || 1 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, when it rains in the
        month of Saawan, four are delighted: the snake, the deer, the
        fish and the wealthy people who seek pleasure.  || 1 ||   FIRST
        MEHL:  O Nanak, when it rains in the month of Saawan, four suffer
        the pains of separation: the cow's calves, the poor, the
        travellers and the servants.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You are True,
        O True Lord; You dispense True Justice. Like a lotus, You sit
        in the primal celestial trance; You are hidden from view. Brahma
        is called great, but even he does not know Your limits. You have
        no father or mother; who gave birth to You? You have no form or
        feature; You transcend all social classes. You have no hunger
        or thirst; You are satisfied and satiated. You have merged Yourself
        into the Guru; You are pervading through the Word of Your Shabad.
        When he is pleasing to the True Lord, the mortal merges in Truth.
        || 2 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  The physician was called in;
        he touched my arm and felt my pulse. The foolish physician did
        not know that the pain was in the mind.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:
        O physician, you are a competent physician, if you first diagnose
        the disease. Prescribe such a remedy, by which all sorts of illnesses
        may be cured. Administer that medicine, which will cure the disease,
        and allow peace to come and dwell in the body. Only when you are
        rid of your own disease, O Nanak, will you be known as a physician.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and the deities were
        created. Brahma was given the Vedas, and enjoined to worship God.
        The ten incarnations, and Rama the king, came into being. According
        to His Will, they quickly killed all the demons. Shiva serves
        Him, but cannot find His limits. He established His throne on
        the principles of Truth. He enjoined all the world to its tasks,
        while He keeps Himself hidden from view. <br>

        O my companions; think of your Husband Lord. O Nanak, the discarded
        bride is in love with another; now she weeps and wails, and dies.
        || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  The month of Saawan has come, O my companions;
        the clouds have burst forth with rain. O Nanak, the blessed soul-brides
        sleep in peace; they are in love with their Husband Lord.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself has staged the tournament, and arranged
        the arena for the wrestlers. They have entered the arena with
        pomp and ceremony; the Gurmukhs are joyful. The false and foolish
        self-willed manmukhs are defeated and overcome. The Lord Himself
        wrestles, and He Himself defeats them. He Himself staged this
        play. The One God is the Lord and Master of all; this is known
        by the Gurmukhs. He writes the inscription of His Hukam on the
        foreheads of all, without pen or ink. In the Sat Sangat, the True
        Congregation, Union with Him is obtained; there, the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord are chanted forever. O Nanak, praising the
        True Word of His Shabad, one comes to realize the Truth.  || 4
        ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Hanging low, low and thick in the sky,
        the clouds are changing color. How do I know whether my love for
        my Husband Lord shall endure? The love of those soul-brides endures,
        if their minds are filled with the Love and the Fear of God. O
        Nanak, she who has no Love and Fear of God - her body shall
        never find peace.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Hanging low, low and
        thick in the sky, the clouds come, and pure water rains down.
        O Nanak, that soul-bride suffers in pain, whose mind is torn away
        from her Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The One Lord created
        both sides and pervades the expanse. The words of the Vedas became
        pervasive, with arguments and divisions. Attachment and detachment
        are the two sides of it; Dharma, true religion, is the guide between
        the two. The self-willed manmukhs are worthless and false. Without
        a doubt, they lose in the Court of the Lord. Those who follow
        the Guru's Teachings are the true spiritual warriors; they
        have conquered sexual desire and anger. They enter into the True
        Mansion of the Lord's Presence, embellished and exalted
        by the Word of the Shabad. Those devotees are pleasing to Your
        Will, O Lord; they dearly love the True Name. I am a sacrifice
        to those who serve their True Guru.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Hanging low, low and thick in the sky, the clouds come,
        and water rains down in torrents. O Nanak, she walks in harmony
        with the Will of her Husband Lord; she enjoys peace and pleasure
        forever.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Why are you standing up, standing
        up to look? You poor wretch, this cloud has nothing in its hands.
        The One who sent this cloud - cherish Him in your mind.
        He alone enshrines the Lord in his mind, upon whom the Lord bestows
        His Glance of Grace. O Nanak, all those who lack this Grace, cry
        and weep and wail.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Serve the Lord forever;
        He acts in no time at all. He stretched the sky across the heavens;
        in an instant, He creates and destroys. He Himself created the
        world; He contemplates His Creative Omnipotence. The self-willed
        manmukh will be called to account hereafter; he will be severely
        punished. <br>

      <p> The Gurmukh's account is settled with honor; the Lord blesses
        him with the treasure of His Praise. No one's hands can
        reach there; no one will hear anyone's cries. The True
        Guru will be your best friend there; at the very last instant,
        He will save you. These beings should serve no other than the
        True Guru or the Creator Lord above the heads of all.  || 6 ||
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O sparrow-hawk, the One unto whom you
        call - everyone longs for that Lord. When He grants His
        Grace, it rains, and the forests and fields blossom forth in their
        greenery. By Guru's Grace, He is found; only a rare few
        understand this. Sitting down and standing up, meditate continually
        on Him, and be at peace forever and ever. O Nanak, the Ambrosial
        Nectar rains down forever; the Lord gives it to the Gurmukh. 
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  When the people of the world are suffering
        in pain, they call upon the Lord in loving prayer. The True Lord
        naturally listens and hears and gives comfort. He commands the
        god of rain, and the rain pours down in torrents. Corn and wealth
        are produced in great abundance and prosperity; their value cannot
        be estimated. O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord;
        He reaches out and gives sustenance to all beings. Eating this,
        peace is produced, and the mortal never again suffers in pain.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O Dear Lord, You are the Truest of the True.
        You blend those who are truthful into Your Own Being. Those caught
        in duality are on the side of duality; entrenched in falsehood,
        they cannot merge into the Lord. You Yourself unite, and You Yourself
        separate; You display Your Creative Omnipotence. Attachment brings
        the sorrow of separation; the mortal acts in accordance with pre-ordained
        destiny. I am a sacrifice to those who remain lovingly attached
        to the Lord's Feet. They are like the lotus which remains
        detached, floating upon the water. They are peaceful and beautiful
        forever; they eradicate self-conceit from within. They never suffer
        sorrow or separation; they are merged in the Being of the Lord.
        || 7 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, praise the Lord; everything
        is in His power. Serve Him, O mortal beings; there is none other
        than Him. The Lord God abides within the mind of the Gurmukh,
        and then he is at peace, forever and ever. He is never cynical;
        all anxiety has been taken out from within him. Whatever happens,
        happens naturally; no one has any say about it. When the True
        Lord abides in the mind, then the mind's desires are fulfilled.
        O Nanak, He Himself hears the words of those, whose accounts are
        in His Hands.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The Ambrosial Nectar rains
        down continually; realize this through realization. Those who,
        as Gurmukh, realize this, keep the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar
        enshrined within their hearts. They drink in the Lord's
        Ambrosial Nectar, and remain forever imbued with the Lord; they
        conquer egotism and thirsty desires. The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial
        Nectar; the Lord showers His Grace, and it rains down. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukh comes to behold the Lord, the Supreme Soul.  || 2

      <p> PAUREE:  How can the unweighable be weighed? Without weighing
        Him, He cannot be obtained. Reflect on the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, and immerse yourself in His Glorious Virtues. He Himself
        weighs Himself; He unites in Union with Himself. His value cannot
        be estimated; nothing can be said about this. I am a sacrifice
        to my Guru; He has made me realize this true realization. The
        world has been deceived, and the Ambrosial Nectar is being plundered.
        The self-willed manmukh does not realize this. Without the Name,
        nothing will go along with him; he wastes his life, and departs.
        Those who follow the Guru's Teachings and remain awake
        and aware, preserve and protect the home of their heart; demons
        have no power against them.  || 8 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O
        sparrow-hawk, do not cry out. Do not let this mind of yours be
        so thirsty for a drop of water. Obey the Hukam, the Command of
        your Lord and Master, and your thirst shall be quenched. Your
        love for Him shall increase four-fold.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        O sparrow-hawk, your place is in the water; you move around in
        the water. But you do not appreciate the water, and so you cry
        out. In the water and on the land, it rains down in the ten directions.
        No place is left dry. With so much rain, those who are die of
        thirst are very unfortunate. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs understand;
        the Lord abides within their minds.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Yogic
        Masters, celibates, Siddhas and spiritual teachers - none
        of them has found the limits of the Lord. The Gurmukhs meditate
        on the Naam, and merge in You, O Lord. For thirty-six ages, God
        remained in utter darkness, as He pleased. The vast expanse of
        water swirled around. The Creator of all is Infinite, Endless
        and Inaccessible. He formed fire and conflict, hunger and thirst.
        Death hangs over the heads of the people of the world, in the
        love of duality. The Savior Lord saves those who realize the Word
        of the Shabad.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  This rain pours
        down on all; it rains down in accordance with God's Loving
        Will. Those trees become green and lush, which remain immersed
        in the Guru's Word. O Nanak, by His Grace, there is peace;
        the pain of these creatures is gone.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The
        night is wet with dew; lightning flashes, and the rain pours down
        in torrents. Food and wealth are produced in abundance when it
        rains, if it is the Will of God. Consuming it, the minds of His
        creatures are satisfied, and they adopt the lifestyle of the way.
        This wealth is the play of the Creator Lord. Sometimes it comes,
        and sometimes it goes. The Naam is the wealth of the spiritually
        wise. It is permeating and pervading forever. O Nanak, those who
        are blessed with His Glance of Grace receive this wealth.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself does, and causes all to be done. Unto
        whom can I complain? He Himself calls the mortal beings to account;
        He Himself causes them to act. Whatever pleases Him happens. Only
        a fool issues commands. He Himself saves and redeems; He Himself
        is the Forgiver. He Himself sees, and He Himself hears; He gives
        His Support to all. He alone is pervading and permeating all;
        He considers each and every one. <br>

      <p> The Gurmukh reflects on the self, lovingly attached to the True
        Lord. O Nanak, whom can we ask? He Himself is the Great Giver.
        || 10 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  This world is a sparrow-hawk;
        let no one be deluded by doubt. This sparrow-hawk is an animal;
        it has no understanding at all. The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial
        Nectar; drinking it in, thirst is quenched. O Nanak, those Gurmukhs
        who drink it in shall never again be afflicted by thirst.  ||
        1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Malaar is a calming and soothing raga; meditating
        on the Lord brings peace and tranquility. When the Dear Lord grants
        His Grace, then the rain falls on all the people of the world.
        From this rain, all creatures find the ways and means to live,
        and the earth is embellished. O Nanak, this world is all water;
        everything came from water. By Guru's Grace, a rare few
        realize the Lord; such humble beings are liberated forever.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  O True and Independent Lord God, You alone are
        my Lord and Master. You Yourself are everything; who else is of
        any account? False is the pride of man. True is Your glorious
        greatness. Coming and going in reincarnation, the beings and species
        of the world came into being. But if the mortal serves his True
        Guru, his coming into the world is judged to be worthwhile. And
        if he eradicates eogtism from within himself, then how can he
        be judged? The self-willed manmukh is lost in the darkness of
        emotional attachment, like the man lost in the wilderness. Countless
        sins are erased, by even a tiny particle of the Lord's
        Name.  || 11 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O sparrow-hawk, you do
        not know the Mansion of your Lord and Master's Presence.
        Offer your prayers to see this Mansion. You speak as you please,
        but your speech is not accepted. Your Lord and Master is the Great
        Giver; whatever you desire, you shall receive from Him. Not only
        the thirst of the poor sparrow-hawk, but the thirst of the whole
        world is quenched.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The night is wet with
        dew; the sparrow-hawk sings the True Name with intuitive ease.
        This water is my very soul; without water, I cannot survive. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, this water is obtained,
        and egotism is eradicated from within. O Nanak, I cannot live
        without Him, even for a moment; the True Guru has led me to meet
        Him.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  There are countless worlds and nether
        regions; I cannot calculate their number. You are the Creator,
        the Lord of the Universe; You create it, and You destroy it. The
        8.4 million species of beings issued forth from You. Some are
        called kings, emperors and nobles. Some claim to be bankers and
        accumulate wealth, but in duality they lose their honor. Some
        are givers, and some are beggars; God is above the heads of all.
        Without the Name, they are vulgar, dreadful and wretched. Falsehood
        shall not last, O Nanak; whatever the True Lord does, comes to
        pass.  || 12 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O sparrow-hawk, the virtuous
        soul-bride attains the Mansion of her Lord's Presence;
        the unworthy, unvirtuous one is far away. Deep within your inner
        being, the Lord abides. The Gurmukh beholds Him ever-present.
        When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, the mortal no longer
        weeps and wails. <br>

      <p> O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam intuitively merge
        with the Lord; they practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The sparrow-hawk prays: O Lord, grant
        Your Grace, and bless me with the gift of the life of the soul.
        Without the water, my thirst is not quenched, and my breath of
        life is ended and gone. You are the Giver of peace, O Infinite
        Lord God; You are the Giver of the treasure of virtue. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukh is forgiven; in the end, the Lord God shall be your
        only friend.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He created the world; He considers
        the merits and demerits of the mortals. Those who are entangled
        in the three gunas - the three dispositions - do
        not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Forsaking virtue, they
        practice evil; they shall be miserable in the Court of the Lord.
        They lose their life in the gamble; why did they even come into
        the world? But those who conquer and subdue their minds, through
        the True Word of the Shabad - night and day, they love
        the Naam. Those people enshrine the True, Invisible and Infinite
        Lord in their hearts. You, O Lord, are the Giver, the Treasure
        of virtue; I am unvirtuous and unworthy. He alone finds You, whom
        You bless and forgive, and inspire to contemplate the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        faithless cynics forget the Name of the Lord; the night of their
        lives does not pass in peace. Their days and nights become comfortable,
        O Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||  
        FIFTH MEHL:  All sorts of jewels and gems, diamonds and rubies,
        shine forth from their foreheads. O Nanak, those who are pleasing
        to God, look beautiful in the Court of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Serving the True Guru, I dwell on the True Lord. The work you
        have done for the True Guru shall be very useful in the end. The
        Messenger of Death cannot even touch that person who is protected
        by the True Lord. Lighting the lamp of the Guru's Teachings,
        my awareness has been awakened. The self-willed manmukhs are false;
        without the Name, they wander around like demons. They are nothing
        more than beasts, wrapped up in human skin; they are black-hearted
        within. The True Lord is pervading all; through the True Word
        of the Shabad, He is seen. O Nanak, the Naam is the greatest treasure.
        The Perfect Guru has revealed it to me. || 14 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  The sparrow-hawk realizes the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command with intuitive ease through the Guru. The clouds mercifully
        burst forth, and the rain pours down in torrents. The cries and
        wailings of the sparrow-hawk have ceased, and peace has come to
        abide in its mind. O Nanak, praise that Lord, who reaches out
        and gives sustenance to all beings and creatures.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  O sparrow-hawk, you do not know what thirst is within you,
        or what you can drink to quench it. You wander in the love of
        duality, and you do not obtain the Ambrosial Water. When God casts
        His Glance of Grace, then the mortal automatically meets the True
        Guru. O Nanak, the Ambrosial Water is obtained from the True Guru,
        and then the mortal remains merged in the Lord with intuitive
        ease.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Some go and sit in the forest realms,
        and do not answer any calls. Some, in the dead of winter, break
        the ice and immerse themselves in freezing water. Some rub ashes
        on their bodies, and never wash off their dirt. <br>

      <p> Some look hideous, with their uncut hair matted and dishevelled.
        They bring dishonor to their family and ancestry. Some wander
        naked day and night and never sleep. Some burn their limbs in
        fire, damaging and ruining themselves. Without the Name, the body
        is reduced to ashes; what good is it to speak and cry then? Those
        who serve the True Guru, are embellished and exalted in the Court
        of their Lord and Master.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The
        sparrow-hawk chirps in the ambrosial hours of the morning before
        the dawn; its prayers are heard in the Court of the Lord. The
        order is issued to the clouds, to let the rains of mercy shower
        down. I am a sacrifice to those who enshrine the True Lord within
        their hearts. O Nanak, through the Name, all are rejuvenated,
        contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 || 
        THIRD MEHL:  O sparrow-hawk, this is not the way to quench your
        thirst, even though you may cry out a hundred times. By God's
        Grace, the True Guru is found; by His Grace, love wells up. O
        Nanak, when the Lord and Master abides in the mind, corruption
        and evil leave from within.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Some are Jains,
        wasting their time in the wilderness; by their pre-ordained destiny,
        they are ruined. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is not on their
        lips; they do not bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. They
        pull out their hair with their hands, instead of shaving. They
        remain unclean day and night; they do not love the Word of the
        Shabad. They have no status, no honor, and no good karma. They
        waste away their lives in vain. Their minds are false and impure;
        that which they eat is impure and defiled. Without the Shabad,
        no one achieves a lifestyle of good conduct. The Gurmukh is absorbed
        in the True Lord God, the Universal Creator.  || 16 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  In the month of Saawan, the bride is happy, contemplating
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. O Nanak, she is a happy
        soul-bride forever; her love for the Guru is unlimited.  || 1
        ||   THIRD MEHL:  In Saawan, she who has no virtue is burned,
        in attachment and love of duality. O Nanak, she does not appreciate
        the value of her Husband Lord; all her decorations are worthless.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The True, Unseen, Mysterious Lord is not won
        over by stubbornness. Some sing according to traditional ragas,
        but the Lord is not pleased by these ragas. Some dance and dance
        and keep the beat, but they do not worship Him with devotion.
        Some refuse to eat; what can be done with these fools? Thirst
        and desire have greatly increased; nothing brings satisfaction.
        Some are tied down by rituals; they hassle themselves to death.
        In this world, profit comes by drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar
        of the Naam. The Gurmukhs gather in loving devotional worship
        of the Lord.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Those Gurmukhs
        who sing in the Raga of Malaar - their minds and bodies
        become cool and calm. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        they realize the One, the One True Lord. Their minds and bodies
        are true; they obey the True Lord, and they are known as true.
        True devotional worship is deep within them; they are automatically
        blessed with honor. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, there is utter
        darkness; the self-willed manmukh cannot find the way. O Nanak,
        very blessed are those Gurmukhs, unto whom the Lord is revealed.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The clouds rain down mercifully, and joy
        wells up in the minds of the people. <br>

      <p> I am forever a sacrifice to the One, by whose Command the clouds
        burst forth with rain. The Gurmukhs dwell on the Word of the Shabad.
        They sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. O Nanak, those
        humble beings who are imbued with the Naam are pure and immaculate.
        They are intuitively merged in the True Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Serving the Perfect True Guru, I have found the Perfect Lord.
        Meditating on the Perfect Lord, by perfect karma, I have enshrined
        the Shabad within my mind. Through perfect spiritual wisdom and
        meditation, my filth has been washed away. The Lord is my sacred
        shrine of pilgrimage and pool of purification; I wash my mind
        in Him. One who dies in the Shabad and conquers his mind -
        blessed is the mother who gave birth to him. He is true in the
        Court of the Lord, and his coming into this world is judged to
        be true. No one can challenge that person, with whom our Lord
        and Master is pleased. O Nanak, praising the True Lord, his pre-ordained
        destiny is activated.  || 18 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Those
        who give out ceremonial hats of recognition are fools; those who
        receive them have no shame. The mouse cannot enter its hole with
        a basket tied around its waist. Those who give out blessings shall
        die, and those that they bless shall also depart. O Nanak, no
        one knows the Lord's Command, by which all must depart.
        The spring harvest is the Name of the One Lord; the harvest of
        autumn is the True Name. I receive a letter of pardon from my
        Lord and Master, when I reach His Court. There are so many courts
        of the world, and so many who come and go there. There are so
        many beggars begging; so many beg and beg until death.  || 1 ||
        FIRST MEHL:  The elephant eats a hundred pounds of ghee and
        molasses, and five hundred pounds of corn. He belches and grunts
        and scatters dust, and when the breath leaves his body, he regrets
        it. The blind and arrogant die insane. Submitting to the Lord,
        one become pleasing to Him. The sparrow eats only half a grain,
        then it flies through the sky and chirps. The good sparrow is
        pleasing to her Lord and Master, if she chirps the Name of the
        Lord. The powerful tiger kills hundreds of deer, and all sorts
        of other animals eat what it leaves. It becomes very strong, and
        cannot be contained in its den, but when it must go, it regrets.
        So who is impressed by the roar of the blind beast? He is not
        pleasing at all to his Lord and Master. The insect loves the milkweed
        plant; perched on its branch, it eats it. It becomes good and
        pleasing to its Lord and Master, if it chirps the Name of the
        Lord. O Nanak, the world lasts for only a few days; indulging
        in pleasures, pain is produced. There are many who boast and brag,
        but none of them can remain detached from the world. The fly dies
        for the sake of sweets. O Lord, death does not even approach those
        whom You protect. You carry them across the terrifying world-ocean.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You are Inaccessible and Unfathomable, O Invisible
        and Infinite True Lord Master. You are the Giver, all are beggars
        of You. You alone are the Great Giver. Those who serve You find
        peace, reflecting on the Guru's Teachings. Some, according
        to Your Will, are in love with Maya. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, praise the Lord with love and affection within. Without
        love, there is no devotion. Without the True Guru, love is not
        enshrined. You are the Lord God; everyone serves You. This is
        the prayer of Your humble minstrel. </p>
