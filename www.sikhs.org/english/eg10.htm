      <p> Shower Your Mercy upon me, God; let me be committed to devotional
        worship. Nanak drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of Truth.  || 4
        || 28 || 35 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord of the Universe,
        the Support of the earth, has become Merciful; the rain is falling
        everywhere. He is Merciful to the meek, always Kind and Gentle;
        the Creator has brought cooling relief.  || 1 ||   He cherishes
        all His beings and creatures, as the mother cares for her children.
        The Destroyer of pain, the Ocean of Peace, the Lord and Master
        gives sustenance to all.  || 2 ||   The Merciful Lord is totally
        pervading and permeating the water and the land. I am forever
        devoted, a sacrifice to Him. Night and day, I always meditate
        on Him; in an instant, He saves all.  || 3 ||   God Himself protects
        all; He drives out all sorrow and suffering. Chanting the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, the mind and body are rejuvenated. O Nanak,
        God has bestowed His Glance of Grace.  || 4 || 29 || 36 ||   MAAJH,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Where the Naam, the Name of God the Beloved is chanted - those
        barren places become mansions of gold. Where the Naam, the Name
        of my Lord of the Universe is not chanted - those towns are
        like the barren wilderness.  || 1 ||   One who meditates as he
        eats dry bread, sees the Blessed Lord inwardly and outwardly.
        Know this well, that one who eats and eats while practicing evil,
        is like a field of poisonous plants.  || 2 ||   One who does not
        feel love for the Saints, misbehaves in the company of the wicked
        shaaktas, the faithless cynics; he wastes this human body, so
        difficult to obtain. In his ignorance, he tears up his own roots.
        || 3 ||   I seek Your Sanctuary, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek,
        Ocean of Peace, my Guru, Sustainer of the world. Shower Your Mercy
        upon Nanak, that he may sing Your Glorious Praises; please, preserve
        my honor.  || 4 || 30 || 37 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  I cherish
        in my heart the Feet of my Lord and Master. All my troubles and
        sufferings have run away. The music of intuitive peace, poise
        and tranquility wells up within; I dwell in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||   The bonds of love with the
        Lord are never broken. The Lord is totally permeating and pervading
        inside and out. Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance
        on Him, singing His Glorious Praises, the noose of death is cut
        away.  || 2 ||   The Ambrosial Nectar, the Unstruck Melody of
        Gurbani rains down continually; deep within my mind and body,
        peace and tranquility have come. Your humble servants remain satisfied
        and fulfilled, and the True Guru blesses them with encouragement
        and comfort.  || 3 ||   We are His, and from Him, we receive our
        rewards. Showering His Mercy upon us, God has united us with Him.
        Our comings and goings have ended, and through great good fortune,
        O Nanak, our hopes are fulfilled.  || 4 || 31 || 38 ||   MAAJH,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The rain has fallen; I have found the Transcendent
        Lord God. All beings and creatures dwell in peace. Suffering has
        been dispelled, and true happiness has dawned, as we meditate
        on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   The One, to whom
        we belong, cherishes and nurtures us. The Supreme Lord God has
        become our Protector. </p>

      <p> My Lord and Master has heard my prayer; my efforts have been rewarded.
        || 2 ||   He is the Giver of all souls. By Guru's Grace,
        He blesses us with His Glance of Grace. The beings in the water,
        on the land and in the sky are all satisfied; I wash the Feet
        of the Holy.  || 3 ||   He is the Fulfiller of the desires of
        the mind. Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. O Nanak,
        the Destroyer of pain has given this Gift; I am imbued with the
        Love of the Delightful Lord.  || 4 || 32 || 39 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Mind and body are Yours; all wealth is Yours. You are my
        God, my Lord and Master. Body and soul and all riches are Yours.
        Yours is the Power, O Lord of the World.  || 1 ||   Forever and
        ever, You are the Giver of Peace. I bow down and fall at Your
        Feet. I act as it pleases You, as You cause me to act, Kind and
        Compassionate Dear Lord.  || 2 ||   O God, from You I receive;
        You are my decoration. Whatever You give me, brings me happiness.
        Wherever You keep me, is heaven. You are the Cherisher of all.
        || 3 ||   Meditating, meditating in remembrance, Nanak has found
        peace. Twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises.
        All my hopes and desires are fulfilled; I shall never again suffer
        sorrow.  || 4 || 33 || 40 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Supreme
        Lord God has unleashed the rain clouds. Over the sea and over
        the land - over all the earth's surface, in all directions,
        He has brought the rain. Peace has come, and the thirst of all
        has been quenched; there is joy and ecstasy everywhere.  || 1
        ||   He is the Giver of Peace, the Destroyer of pain. He gives
        and forgives all beings. He Himself nurtures and cherishes His
        Creation. I fall at His Feet and surrender to Him.  || 2 ||  
        Seeking His Sanctuary, salvation is obtained. With each and every
        breath, I meditate on the Lord's Name. Without Him, there
        is no other Lord and Master. All places belong to Him.  || 3 ||
        Yours is the Honor, God, and Yours is the Power. You are the
        True Lord and Master, the Ocean of Excellence. Servant Nanak utters
        this prayer: may I meditate on You twenty-four hours a day.  ||
        4 || 34 || 41 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  All happiness comes, when
        God is pleased. The Feet of the Perfect Guru dwell in my mind.
        I am intuitively absorbed in the state of Samaadhi deep within.
        God alone knows this sweet pleasure.  || 1 ||   My Lord and Master
        is Inaccessible and Unfathomable. Deep within each and every heart,
        He dwells near and close at hand. He is always detached; He is
        the Giver of souls. How rare is that person who understands his
        own self.  || 2 ||   This is the sign of union with God: in the
        mind, the Command of the True Lord is recognized. Intuitive peace
        and poise, contentment, enduring satisfaction and bliss come through
        the Pleasure of the Master's Will.  || 3 ||   God, the Great
        Giver, has given me His Hand. He has erased all the sickness of
        birth and death. O Nanak, those whom God has made His slaves,
        rejoice in the pleasure of singing the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises.  || </p>

      <p> 4 || 35 || 42 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Life of the World,
        the Sustainer of the Earth, has showered His Mercy; the Guru's
        Feet have come to dwell within my mind. The Creator has made me
        His Own. He has destroyed the city of sorrow.  || 1 ||   The True
        One abides within my mind and body; no place seems difficult to
        me now. All the evil-doers and enemies have now become my friends.
        I long only for my Lord and Master.  || 2 ||   Whatever He does,
        He does all by Himself. No one can know His Ways. He Himself is
        the Helper and Support of His Saints. God has cast out my doubts
        and delusions.  || 3 ||   His Lotus Feet are the Support of His
        humble servants. Twenty-four hours a day, they deal in the Name
        of the Lord. In peace and pleasure, they sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord of the Universe. O Nanak, God is permeating everywhere.
        || 4 || 36 || 43 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  True is that temple,
        within which one meditates on the True Lord. Blessed is that heart,
        within which the Lord's Glorious Praises are sung. Beautiful
        is that land, where the Lord's humble servants dwell. I am
        a sacrifice to the True Name.  || 1 ||   The extent of the True
        Lord's Greatness cannot be known. His Creative Power and
        His Bounties cannot be described. Your humble servants live by
        meditating, meditating on You. Their minds treasure the True Word
        of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   The Praises of the True One are obtained
        by great good fortune. By Guru's Grace, the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord are sung. Those who are imbued with Your Love are
        pleasing to You. The True Name is their Banner and Insignia. 
        || 3 ||   No one knows the limits of the True Lord. In all places
        and interspaces, the True One is pervading. O Nanak, meditate
        forever on the True One, the Searcher of hearts, the Knower of
        all.  || 4 || 37 || 44 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  Beautiful is
        the night, and beautiful is the day, when one joins the Society
        of the Saints and chants the Ambrosial Naam. If you remember the
        Lord in meditation for a moment, even for an instant, then your
        life will become fruitful and prosperous.  || 1 ||   Remembering
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all sinful mistakes are erased.
        Inwardly and outwardly, the Lord God is always with us. Fear,
        dread and doubt have been dispelled by the Perfect Guru; now,
        I see God everywhere.  || 2 ||   God is All-powerful, Vast, Lofty
        and Infinite. The Naam is overflowing with the nine treasures.
        In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, there is God.
        Nothing else even comes close to Him.  || 3 ||   Take pity on
        me, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek. I am a beggar, begging for
        the dust of the feet of the Holy. Servant Nanak begs for this
        gift: let me meditate on the Lord, forever and ever.  || 4 ||
        38 || 45 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are here, and You are hereafter.
        All beings and creatures were created by You. Without You, there
        is no other, O Creator. You are my Support and my Protection.
        || 1 ||   The tongue lives by chanting and meditating on the
        Lord's Name. The Supreme Lord God is the Inner-knower, the
        Searcher of hearts. Those who serve the Lord find peace; they
        do not lose their lives in the gamble.  || 2 || </p>

      <p> Your humble servant, who obtains the Medicine of the Naam, is
        rid of the illnesses of countless lifetimes and incarnations.
        So sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, day and night.
        This is the most fruitful occupation.  || 3 ||   Bestowing His
        Glance of Grace, He has adorned His slave. Deep within each and
        every heart, the Supreme Lord is humbly worshipped. Without the
        One, there is no other at all. O Baba Nanak, this is the most
        excellent wisdom.  || 4 || 39 || 46 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        My mind and body are imbued with love for the Lord. I sacrifice
        everything for Him. Twenty-four hours a day, sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Do not forget Him, for even
        one breath.  || 1 ||   He is a companion, a friend, and a beloved
        of mine, who reflects upon the Lord's Name, in the Company
        of the Holy. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, cross
        over the world-ocean, and the noose of death shall be cut away.
        || 2 ||   The four cardinal blessings are obtained by serving
        the Lord. The Elysian Tree, the source of all blessings, is meditation
        on the Unseen and Unknowable Lord. The Guru has cut out the sinful
        mistakes of sexual desire and anger, and my hopes have been fulfilled.
        || 3 ||   That mortal who is blessed by perfect destiny meets
        the Lord, the Sustainer of the Universe, in the Company of the
        Holy. O Nanak, if the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells within
        the mind, one is approved and accepted, whether he is a house-holder
        or a renunciate.  || 4 || 40 || 47 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, my heart is filled with peace.
        By His Grace, His devotees become famous and acclaimed. Joining
        the Society of the Saints, I chant the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har; the disease of laziness has disappeared.  || 1 ||   O Siblings
        of Destiny, the nine treasures are found in the Home of the Lord;
        He comes to meet those who deserve it by their past actions. The
        Perfect Transcendent Lord is spiritual wisdom and meditation.
        God is All-powerful to do all things.  || 2 ||   In an instant,
        He establishes and disestablishes. He Himself is the One, and
        He Himself is the Many. Filth does not stick to the Giver, the
        Life of the World. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan,
        the pain of separation departs.  || 3 ||   Holding on to the hem
        of His Robe, the entire Universe is saved. He Himself causes His
        Name to be chanted. The Boat of the Guru is found by His Grace;
        O Nanak, such blessed destiny is pre-ordained.  || 4 || 41 ||
        48 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  People do whatever the Lord inspires
        them to do. Wherever He keeps us is a good place. That person
        is clever and honorable, unto whom the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command seems sweet.  || 1 ||   Everything is strung upon the
        One String of the Lord. Those whom the Lord attaches, are attached
        to His Feet. Those, whose inverted lotus of the crown chakra is
        illuminated, see the Immaculate Lord everywhere.  || 2 ||   Only
        You Yourself know Your Glory. You Yourself recognize Your Own
        Self. I am a sacrifice to Your Saints, who have crushed their
        sexual desire, anger and greed.  || 3 ||   You have no hatred
        or vengeance; Your Saints are immaculate and pure. Seeing them,
        all sins depart. Nanak lives by meditating, meditating on the
        Naam. </p>

      <p> His stubborn doubt and fear have departed.  || 4 || 42 || 49 ||
        MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who asks for a false gift, shall not
        take even an instant to die. But one who continually serves the
        Supreme Lord God and meets the Guru, is said to be immortal. 
        || 1 ||   One whose mind is dedicated to loving devotional worship
        sings His Glorious Praises night and day, and remains forever
        awake and aware. Taking him by the hand, the Lord and Master merges
        into Himself that person, upon whose forehead such destiny is
        written.  || 2 ||   His Lotus Feet dwell in the minds of His devotees.
        Without the Transcendent Lord, all are plundered. I long for the
        dust of the feet of His humble servants. The Name of the True
        Lord is my decoration.  || 3 ||   Standing up and sitting down,
        I sing the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Meditating in remembrance
        on Him, I obtain my Eternal Husband Lord. God has become merciful
        to Nanak. I cheerfully accept Your Will.  || 4 || 43 || 50 || </p>

        RAAG MAAJH,  ASHTAPADEES:  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> By His Command, all are attuned to the Word of the Shabad, and
        all are called to the Mansion of His Presence, the True Court
        of the Lord. O my True Lord and Master, Merciful to the meek,
        my mind is pleased and appeased by the Truth.  || 1 ||   I am
        a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who are adorned
        with the Word of the Shabad. The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is forever the Giver of Peace. Through the Guru's Teachings,
        it dwells in the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   No one is mine, and
        I am no one else's. The True Lord and Master of the three
        worlds is mine. Acting in egotism, so very many have died. After
        making mistakes, they later repent and regret.  || 2 ||   Those
        who recognize the Hukam of the Lord's Command chant the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        they are glorified with the Naam. Everyone's account is kept
        in the True Court, and through the Beauty of the Naam, they are
        saved.  || 3 ||   The self-willed manmukhs are deluded; they find
        no place of rest. Bound and gagged at Death's Door, they
        are brutally beaten. Without the Name, there are no companions
        or friends. Liberation comes only by meditating on the Naam. 
        || 4 ||   The false shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not like
        the Truth. Bound by duality, they come and go in reincarnation.
        No one can erase pre-recorded destiny; the Gurmukhs are liberated.
        || 5 ||   In this world of her parents' house, the young
        bride did not know her Husband. Through falsehood, she has been
        separated from Him, and she cries out in misery. Defrauded by
        demerits, she does not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
        But through virtuous actions, her demerits are forgiven.  || 6
        ||   She, who knows her Beloved in her parents' house, as
        Gurmukh, comes to understand the essence of reality; she contemplates
        her Lord. Her comings and goings cease, and she is absorbed in
        the True Name.  || 7 ||   The Gurmukhs understand and describe
        the Indescribable. True is our Lord and Master; He loves the Truth.
        Nanak offers this true prayer: singing His Glorious Praises, I
        merge with the True One.  || 8 || 1 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL, 
        FIRST HOUSE:  By His Mercy, we meet the True Guru. </p>

      <p> Center your awareness on seva - selfless service - and focus
        your consciousness on the Word of the Shabad. Subduing your ego,
        you shall find a lasting peace, and your emotional attachment
        to Maya will be dispelled.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul
        is a sacrifice, I am totally devoted to the True Guru. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, the Divine Light has dawned; I sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Search your body and mind, and find the Name. Restrain your
        wandering mind, and keep it in check. Night and day, sing the
        Songs of the Guru's Bani; worship the Lord with intuitive
        devotion.  || 2 ||   Within this body are countless objects. The
        Gurmukh attains Truth, and comes to see them. Beyond the nine
        gates, the Tenth Gate is found, and liberation is obtained. The
        Unstruck Melody of the Shabad vibrates.  || 3 ||   True is the
        Master, and True is His Name. By Guru's Grace, He comes to
        dwell within the mind. Night and day, remain attuned to the Lord's
        Love forever, and you shall obtain understanding in the True Court.
        || 4 ||   Those who do not understand the nature of sin and virtue
        are attached to duality; they wander around deluded. The ignorant
        and blind people do not know the way; they come and go in reincarnation
        over and over again.  || 5 ||   Serving the Guru, I have found
        eternal peace; my ego has been silenced and subdued. Through the
        Guru's Teachings, the darkness has been dispelled, and the
        heavy doors have been opened.  || 6 ||   Subduing my ego, I have
        enshrined the Lord within my mind. I focus my consciousness on
        the Guru's Feet forever. By Guru's Grace, my mind and
        body are immaculate and pure; I meditate on the Immaculate Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 7 ||   From birth to death, everything
        is for You. You bestow greatness upon those whom You have forgiven.
        O Nanak, meditating forever on the Naam, you shall be blessed
        in both birth and death.  || 8 || 1 || 2 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:
        My God is Immaculate, Inaccessible and Infinite. Without a scale,
        He weighs the universe. One who becomes Gurmukh, understands.
        Chanting His Glorious Praises, he is absorbed into the Lord of
        Virtue.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to
        those whose minds are filled with the Name of the Lord. Those
        who are committed to Truth remain awake and aware night and day.
        They are honored in the True Court.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself
        hears, and He Himself sees. Those, upon whom He casts His Glance
        of Grace, become acceptable. They are attached, whom the Lord
        Himself attaches; as Gurmukh, they live the Truth.  || 2 ||  
        Those whom the Lord Himself misleads - whose hand can they
        take? That which is pre-ordained, cannot be erased. Those who
        meet the True Guru are very fortunate and blessed; through perfect
        karma, He is met.  || 3 ||   The young bride is fast asleep in
        her parents' home, night and day. She has forgotten her Husband
        Lord; because of her faults and demerits, she is abandoned. She
        wanders around continually, crying out, night and day. Without
        her Husband Lord, she cannot get any sleep.  || 4 ||   In this
        world of her parents' home, she may come to know the Giver
        of peace, if she subdues her ego, and recognizes the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad. Her bed is beautiful; she ravishes and enjoys
        her Husband Lord forever. </p>

      <p> She is adorned with the Decorations of Truth.  || 5 ||   He created
        the 8.4 million species of beings. Those, upon whom He casts His
        Glance of Grace, come to meet the Guru. Shedding the residues
        of their sinful mistakes, His servants are forever pure; at the
        True Court, they are beautified by the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 6 ||   When they are called to settle their accounts, who
        will answer then? There shall be no peace then, from counting
        out by twos and threes. The True Lord God Himself forgives, and
        having forgiven, He unites them with Himself.  || 7 ||   He Himself
        does, and He Himself causes all to be done. Through the Shabad,
        the Word of the Perfect Guru, He is met. O Nanak, through the
        Naam, greatness is obtained. He Himself unites in His Union. 
        || 8 || 2 || 3 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The One Lord Himself
        moves about imperceptibly. As Gurmukh, I see Him, and then this
        mind is pleased and uplifted. Renouncing desire, I have found
        intuitive peace and poise; I have enshrined the One within my
        mind.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to
        those who focus their consciousness on the One. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, my mind has come to its only home; it is imbued with
        the True Color of the Lord's Love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        This world is deluded; You Yourself have deluded it. Forgetting
        the One, it has become engrossed in duality. Night and day, it
        wanders around endlessly, deluded by doubt; without the Name,
        it suffers in pain.  || 2 ||   Those who are attuned to the Love
        of the Lord, the Architect of Destiny - by serving the Guru,
        they are known throughout the four ages. Those, upon whom the
        Lord bestows greatness, are absorbed in the Name of the Lord.
        || 3 ||   Being in love with Maya, they do not think of the Lord.
        Bound and gagged in the City of Death, they suffer in terrible
        pain. Blind and deaf, they see nothing at all; the self-willed
        manmukhs rot away in sin.  || 4 ||   Those, whom You attach to
        Your Love, are attuned to Your Love. Through loving devotional
        worship, they become pleasing to Your Mind. They serve the True
        Guru, the Giver of eternal peace, and all their desires are fulfilled.
        || 5 ||   O Dear Lord, I seek Your Sanctuary forever. You Yourself
        forgive us, and bless us with Glorious Greatness. The Messenger
        of Death does not draw near those who meditate on the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har.  || 6 ||   Night and day, they are attuned
        to His Love; they are pleasing to the Lord. My God merges with
        them, and unites them in Union. Forever and ever, O True Lord,
        I seek the Protection of Your Sanctuary; You Yourself inspire
        us to understand the Truth.  || 7 ||   Those who know the Truth
        are absorbed in Truth. They sing the Lord's Glorious Praises,
        and speak the Truth. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam
        remain unattached and balanced; in the home of the inner self,
        they are absorbed in the primal trance of deep meditation.  ||
        8 || 3 || 4 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  One who dies in the Word
        of the Shabad is truly dead. Death does not crush him, and pain
        does not afflict him. His light merges and is absorbed into the
        Light, when he hears and merges in the Truth.  || 1 ||   I am
        a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to the Lord's Name,
        which brings us to glory. One who serves the True Guru, and focuses
        his consciousness on Truth, following the Guru's Teachings,
        is absorbed in intuitive peace and poise.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        This human body is transitory, and transitory are the garments
        it wears. Attached to duality, no one attains the Mansion of the
        Lord's Presence. </p>

      <p> Night and day, day and night, they burn. Without her Husband Lord,
        the soul-bride suffers in terrible pain.  || 2 ||   Her body and
        her status shall not go with her to the world hereafter. Where
        she is called to answer for her account, there, she shall be emancipated
        only by true actions. Those who serve the True Guru shall prosper;
        here and hereafter, they are absorbed in the Naam.  || 3 ||  
        She who adorns herself with the Love and the Fear of God, by Guru's
        Grace, obtains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence as her
        home. Night and day, day and night, she constantly ravishes and
        enjoys her Beloved. She is dyed in the permanent color of His
        Love.  || 4 ||   The Husband Lord abides with everyone, always;
        but how rare are those few who, by Guru's Grace, obtain His
        Glance of Grace. My God is the Highest of the High; granting His
        Grace, He merges us into Himself.  || 5 ||   This world is asleep
        in emotional attachment to Maya. Forgetting the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, it ultimately comes to ruin. The One who put it to
        sleep shall also awaken it. Through the Guru's Teachings,
        understanding dawns.  || 6 ||   One who drinks in this Nectar,
        shall have his delusions dispelled. By Guru's Grace, the
        state of liberation is attained. One who is imbued with devotion
        to the Lord, remains always balanced and detached. Subduing selfishness
        and conceit, he is united with the Lord.  || 7 ||   He Himself
        creates, and He Himself assigns us to our tasks. He Himself gives
        sustenance to the 8.4 million species of beings. O Nanak, those
        who meditate on the Naam are atuned to Truth. They do that which
        is pleasing to His Will.  || 8 || 4 || 5 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:
        Diamonds and rubies are produced deep within the self. They are
        assayed and valued tthrough the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        Those who have gathered Truth, speak Truth; they apply the Touch-stone
        of Truth.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice,
        to those who enshrine the Word of the Guru's Bani within
        their minds. In the midst of the darkness of the world, they obtain
        the Immaculate One, and their light merges into the Light.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Within this body are countless vast vistas;
        the Immaculate Naam is totally Inaccessible and Infinite. He alone
        becomes Gurmukh and obtains it, whom the Lord forgives, and unites
        with Himself.  || 2 ||   My Lord and Master implants the Truth.
        By Guru's Grace, one's consciousness is attached to
        the Truth. The Truest of the True is pervading everywhere; the
        true ones merge in Truth.  || 3 ||   The True Carefree Lord is
        my Beloved. He cuts out our sinful mistakes and evil actions;
        with love and affection, meditate forever on Him. He implants
        the Fear of God and loving devotional worship within us.  || 4
        ||   Devotional worship is True, if it pleases the True Lord.
        He Himself bestows it; He does not regret it later. He alone is
        the Giver of all beings. The Lord kills with the Word of His Shabad,
        and then revives.  || 5 ||   Other than You, Lord, nothing is
        mine. I serve You, Lord, and I praise You. You unite me with Yourself,
        O True God. Through perfect good karma You are obtained.  || 6
        ||   For me, there is no other like You. By Your Glance of Grace,
        my body is blessed and sanctified. Night and day, the Lord takes
        care of us and protects us. The Gurmukhs are absorbed in intuitive
        peace and poise.  || 7 ||   For me, there is no other as Great
        as You. You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy. </p>

        and embellished with the Naam.  || 8 || 5 || 6 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD
        MEHL:  He is the Enjoyer of all hearts. The Invisible, Inaccessible
        and Infinite is pervading everywhere. Meditating on my Lord God,
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I am intuitively absorbed
        in the Truth.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice,
        to those who implant the Word of the Guru's Shabad in their
        minds. When someone understands the Shabad, then he wrestles with
        his own mind; subduing his desires, he merges with the Lord. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The five enemies are plundering the world.
        The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not understand or appreciate
        this. Those who become Gurmukh - their houses are protected.
        The five enemies are destroyed by the Shabad.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukhs
        are forever imbued with love for the True One. They serve God
        with intuitive ease. Night and day, they are intoxicated with
        His Love. Meeting with their Beloved, they sing the Glorious Praises
        of the True one; they are honored in the Court of the Lord.  ||
        3 ||   First, the One created Himself; second, the sense of duality;
        third, the three-phased Maya. The fourth state, the highest, is
        obtained by the Gurmukh, who practices Truth, and only Truth.
        || 4 ||   Everything which is pleasing to the True Lord is true.
        Those who know the Truth merge in intuitive peace and poise. The
        life-style of the Gurmukh is to serve the True Lord. He goes and
        blends with the True Lord.  || 5 ||   Without the True One, there
        is no other at all. Attached to duality, the world is distracted
        and distressed to death. One who becomes Gurmukh knows only the
        One. Serving the One, peace is obtained.  || 6 ||   All beings
        and creatures are in the Protection of Your Sanctuary. You place
        the chessmen on the board; You see the imperfect and the perfect
        as well. Night and day, You cause people to act; You unite them
        in Union with Yourself.  || 7 ||   You Yourself unite, and You
        see Yourself close at hand. You Yourself are totally pervading
        amongst all. O Nanak, God Himself is pervading and permeating
        everywhere; only the Gurmukhs understand this.  || 8 || 6 || 7
        ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The Nectar of the Guru's Bani is
        very sweet. Rare are the Gurmukhs who see and taste it. The Divine
        Light dawns within, and the supreme essence is found. In the True
        Court, the Word of the Shabad vibrates.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        my soul is a sacrifice, to those who focus their consciousness
        on the Guru's Feet. The True Guru is the True Pool of Nectar;
        bathing in it, the mind is washed clean of all filth.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Your limits, O True Lord, are not known to anyone.
        Rare are those who, by Guru's Grace, focus their consciousness
        on You. Praising You, I am never satisfied; such is the hunger
        I feel for the True Name.  || 2 ||   I see only the One, and no
        other. By Guru's Grace, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.
        My thirst is quenched by the Word of the Guru's Shabad; I
        am absorbed in intuitive peace and poise.  || 3 ||   The Priceless
        Jewel is discarded like straw; the blind self-willed manmukhs
        are attached to the love of duality. As they plant, so do they
        harvest. They shall not obtain peace, even in their dreams.  ||
        4 ||  Those who are blessed with His Mercy find the Lord. The
        Word of the Guru's Shabad abides in the mind. </p>

      <p> Night and day, they remain in the Fear of God; conquering their
        fears, their doubts are dispelled.  || 5 ||   Dispelling their
        doubts, they find a lasting peace. By Guru's Grace, the supreme
        status is attained. Deep within, they are pure, and their words
        are pure as well; intuitively, they sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 6 ||   They recite the Simritees, the Shaastras
        and the Vedas, but deluded by doubt, they do not understand the
        essence of reality. Without serving the True Guru, they find no
        peace; they earn only pain and misery.  || 7 ||   The Lord Himself
        acts; unto whom should we complain? How can anyone complain that
        the Lord has made a mistake? O Nanak, the Lord Himself does, and
        causes things to be done; chanting the Naam, we are absorbed in
        the Naam.  || 8 || 7 || 8 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  He Himself
        imbues us with His Love, with effortless ease. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, we are dyed in the color of the Lord's
        Love. This mind and body are so imbued, and this tongue is dyed
        in the deep crimson color of the poppy. Through the Love and the
        Fear of God, we are dyed in this color.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Fearless Lord
        within their minds. By Guru's Grace, I meditate on the Fearless
        Lord; the Shabad has carried me across the poisonous world-ocean.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The idiotic self-willed manmukhs try to
        be clever, but in spite of their bathing and washing, they shall
        not be acceptable. As they came, so shall they go, regretting
        the mistakes they made.  || 2 ||   The blind, self-willed manmukhs
        do not understand anything; death was pre-ordained for them when
        they came into the world, but they do not understand. The self-willed
        manmukhs may practice religious rituals, but they do not obtain
        the Name; without the Name, they lose this life in vain.  || 3
        ||   The practice of Truth is the essence of the Shabad. Through
        the Perfect Guru, the gate of salvation is found. So, night and
        day, listen to the Word of the Guru's Bani, and the Shabad.
        Let yourself be colored by this love.  || 4 ||   The tongue, imbued
        with the Lord's Essence, delights in His Love. My mind and
        body are enticed by the Lord's Sublime Love. I have easily
        obtained my Darling Beloved; I am intuitively absorbed in celestial
        peace.  || 5 ||   Those who have the Lord's Love within,
        sing His Glorious Praises; through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, they are intuitively absorbed in celestial peace. I am
        forever a sacrifice to those who dedicate their consciousness
        to the Guru's Service.  || 6 ||   The True Lord is pleased
        with Truth, and only Truth. By Guru's Grace, one's inner
        being is deeply imbued with His Love. Sitting in that blessed
        place, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, who Himself inspires
        us to accept His Truth.  || 7 ||   That one, upon whom the Lord
        casts His Glance of Grace, obtains it. By Guru's Grace, egotism
        departs. O Nanak, that one, within whose mind the Name dwells,
        is honored in the True Court.  || 8 || 8 || 9 ||   MAAJH  THIRD
        MEHL:  Serving the True Guru is the greatest greatness. The Dear
        Lord automatically comes to dwell in the mind. The Dear Lord is
        the fruit-bearing tree; drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, thirst
        is quenched.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice,
        to the one who leads me to join the True Congregation. The Lord
        Himself unites me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> I serve the True Guru; the Word of His Shabad is beautiful. Through
        it, the Name of the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. The Pure
        Lord removes the filth of egotism, and we are honored in the True
        Court.  || 2 ||   Without the Guru, the Naam cannot be obtained.
        The Siddhas and the seekers lack it; they weep and wail. Without
        serving the True Guru, peace is not obtained; through perfect
        destiny, the Guru is found.  || 3 ||   This mind is a mirror;
        how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, see themselves in it. Rust
        does not stick to those who burn their ego. The Unstruck Melody
        of the Bani resounds through the Pure Word of the Shabad; through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we are absorbed into the True
        One.  || 4 ||   Without the True Guru, the Lord cannot be seen.
        Granting His Grace, He Himself has allowed me to see Him. All
        by Himself, He Himself is permeating and pervading; He is intuitively
        absorbed in celestial peace.  || 5 ||   One who becomes Gurmukh
        embraces love for the One. Doubt and duality are burned away by
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Within his body, he deals
        and trades, and obtains the Treasure of the True Name.  || 6 ||
        The life-style of the Gurmukh is sublime; he sings the Praises
        of the Lord. The Gurmukh finds the gate of salvation. Night and
        day, he is imbued with the Lord's Love. He sings the Lord's
        Glorious Praises, and he is called to the Mansion of His Presence.
        || 7 ||   The True Guru, the Giver, is met when the Lord leads
        us to meet Him. Through perfect destiny, the Shabad is enshrined
        in the mind. O Nanak, the greatness of the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is obtained by chanting the Glorious Praises of the True
        Lord.  || 8 || 9 || 10 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who lose
        their own selves obtain everything. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, they enshrine Love for the True one. They trade in Truth,
        they gather in Truth, and they deal only in Truth.  || 1 ||  
        I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who sing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day. I am Yours, You are
        my Lord and Master. You bestow greatness through the Word of Your
        Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That time, that moment is totally
        beautiful, when the True One becomes pleasing to my mind. Serving
        the True One, true greatness is obtained. By Guru's Grace,
        the True One is obtained.  || 2 ||   The food of spiritual love
        is obtained when the True Guru is pleased. Other essences are
        forgotten, when the Lord's Essence comes to dwell in the
        mind. Truth, contentment and intuitive peace and poise are obtained
        from the Bani, the Word of the Perfect Guru.  || 3 ||   The blind
        and ignorant fools do not serve the True Guru; how will they find
        the gate of salvation? They die and die, over and over again,
        only to be reborn, over and over again. They are struck down at
        Death's Door.  || 4 ||   Those who know the essence of the
        Shabad, understand their own selves. Immaculate is the speech
        of those who chant the Word of the Shabad. Serving the True One,
        they find a lasting peace; they enshrine the nine treasures of
        the Naam within their minds.  || 5 ||   Beautiful is that place,
        which is pleasing to the Lord's Mind. There, sitting in the
        Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord are sung. Night and day, the True One is praised; the Immaculate
        Sound-current of the Naad resounds there.  || <br>
