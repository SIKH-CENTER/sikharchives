      <p> || 16 || 7 || 21 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  The Formless Lord created
        the universe of form. By the Hukam of His Command, He created
        attachment to Maya. The Creator Himself stages all the plays;
        hearing of the True Lord, enshrine Him in your mind.  || 1 ||
        Maya, the mother, gave birth to the three gunas, the three qualities,
        and proclaimed the four Vedas to Brahma. Creating the years, months,
        days and dates, He infused intelligence into the world.  || 2
        ||   Service to the Guru is the most excellent action. Enshrine
        the Lord's Name within your heart. The Word of the Guru's
        Bani prevails throughout the world; through this Bani, the Lord's
        Name is obtained.  || 3 ||   He reads the Vedas, but he starts
        arguments night and day. He does not remember the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord; he is bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death.
        In the love of duality, he suffers in pain forever; he is deluded
        by doubt, and confused by the three gunas.  || 4 ||   The Gurmukh
        is in love with the One Lord alone; he submerges in his mind the
        three-phased desire. Through the True Word of the Shabad, he is
        liberated forever; he renounces emotional attachment to Maya.
        || 5 ||   Those who are so pre-ordained to be imbued, are imbued
        with love for the Lord. By Guru's Grace, they are intuitively
        intoxicated. Serving the True Guru forever, they find God; He
        Himself unites them with Himself.  || 6 ||   In attachment to
        Maya and doubt, the Lord is not found. Attached to the love of
        duality, one suffers in pain. The crimson color lasts for only
        a few days; all too soon, it fades away.  || 7 ||   So color this
        mind in the Fear and the Love of God. Dyed in this color, one
        merges in the True Lord. By perfect destiny, some may obtain this
        color. Through the Guru's Teachings, this color is applied.
        || 8 ||   The self-willed manmukhs take great pride in themselves.
        In the Court of the Lord, they are never honored. Attached to
        duality, they waste their lives; without understanding, they suffer
        in pain.  || 9 ||   My God has hidden Himself deep within the
        self. By Guru's Grace, one is united in the Lord's
        Union. God is True, and True is His trade, through which the priceless
        Naam is obtained.  || 10 ||   No one has found this body's
        value. My Lord and Master has worked His handiwork. One who becomes
        Gurmukh purifies his body, and then the Lord unites him with Himself.
        || 11 ||   Within the body, one loses, and within the body, one
        wins. The Gurmukh seeks the self-sustaining Lord. The Gurmukh
        trades, and finds peace forever; he intuitively merges in the
        Celestial Lord.  || 12 ||   True is the Lord's Mansion,
        and True is His treasure. The Great Giver Himself gives. The Gurmukh
        praises the Giver of peace; his mind is united with the Lord,
        and he comes to know His worth.  || 13 ||   Within the body is
        the object; its value cannot be estimated. He Himself grants glorious
        greatness to the Gurmukh. He alone knows this object, to whom
        this store belongs; the Gurmukh is blessed with it, and does not
        come to regret.  || 14 ||   The Dear Lord is pervading and permeating
        all. By Guru's Grace, He is found. He Himself unites in
        His Union; through the Word of the Shabad, one intuitively merges
        with Him.  || 15 || <br>

      <p> The True Lord Himself unites us in the Word of His Shabad. Within
        the Shabad, doubt is driven out. O Nanak, He blesses us with His
        Naam, and throgh the Naam, peace is found.  || 16 || 8 || 22 ||
        MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  He is inaccessible, unfathomable and self-sustaining.
        He Himself is merciful, inaccessible and unlimited. No one can
        reach up to Him; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        He is met.  || 1 ||   He alone serves You, who pleases You. Through
        the Guru's Shabad, he merges in the True Lord. Night and
        day, he chants the Lord's Praises, day and night; his tongue
        savors and delights in the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 2
        ||   Those who die in the Shabad - their death is exalted
        and glorified. They enshrine the Lord's Glories in their
        hearts. Holding tight to the Guru's feet, their lives becomes
        prosperous, and they are rid of the love of duality.  || 3 ||
        The Dear Lord unites them in Union with Himself. Through the
        Guru's Shabad, self-conceit is dispelled. Those who remain
        attuned to devotional worship to the Lord, night and day, earn
        the profit in this world.  || 4 ||   What Glorious Virtues of
        Yours should I describe? I cannot describe them. You have no end
        or limitation. Your value cannot be estimated. When the Giver
        of peace Himself bestows His Mercy, the virtuous are absorbed
        in virtue.  || 5 ||   In this world, emotional attachment is spread
        all over. The ignorant, self-willed manmukh is immersed in utter
        darkness. Chasing after worldly affairs, he wastes away his life
        in vain; without the Name, he suffers in pain.  || 6 ||   If God
        grants His Grace, then one finds the True Guru. Through the Shabad,
        the filth of egotism is burned away. The mind becomes immaculate,
        and the jewel of spiritual wisdom brings enlightenment; the darkness
        of spiritual ignorance is dispelled.  || 7 ||   Your Names are
        countless; Your value cannot be estimated. I enshrine the Lord's
        True Name within my heart. Who can estimate Your value, God? You
        are immersed and absorbed in Yourself.  || 8 ||   The Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, is priceless, inaccessible and infinite. No
        one can weigh it. You Yourself weigh, and estimate all; through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You unite, when the weight
        is perfect.  || 9 ||   Your servant serves, and offers this prayer.
        Please, let me sit near You, and unite me with Yourself. You are
        the Giver of peace to all beings; by perfect karma, we meditate
        on You.  || 10 ||   Chastity, truth and self-control come by practicing
        and living the Truth. This mind becomes immaculate and pure, singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. In this world of poison, the
        Ambrosial Nectar is obtained, if it pleases my Dear Lord.  ||
        11 ||   He alone understands, whom God inspires to understand.
        Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, one's inner being
        is awakened. Egotism and possessiveness are silenced and subdued,
        and one intuitively finds the True Lord.  || 12 ||   Without good
        karma, countless others wander around. They die, and die again,
        only to be reborn; they cannot escape the cycle of reincarnation.
        Imbued with poison, they practice poison and corruption, and they
        never find peace.  || 13 ||   Many disguise themselves with religious
        robes. Without the Shabad, no one has conquered egotism. One who
        remains dead while yet alive is liberated, and merges in the True
        Name.  || 14 ||   Spiritual ignorance and desire burn this human
        body. <br>

      <p> He alone puts out this fire, who practices and lives the Guru's
        Shabad. His body and mind are cooled and soothed, and his anger
        is silenced; conquering egotism, he merges in the Lord.  || 15
        ||   True is the Lord and Master, and True is His glorious greatness.
        By Guru's Grace, a rare few attain this. Nanak offers this
        one prayer: through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, may I merge
        in the Lord.  || 16 || 1 || 23 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  By Your
        Grace, please unite with Your devotees. Your devotees ever praise
        You, lovingly focusing on You. In Your Sanctuary, they are saved,
        O Creator Lord; You unite them in Union with Yourself.  || 1 ||
        Sublime and exalted is devotion to the Perfect Word of the Shabad.
        Peace prevails within; they are pleasing to Your Mind. One whose
        mind and body are imbued with true devotion, focuses his consciousness
        on the True Lord.  || 2 ||   In egotism, the body is forever burning.
        When God grants His Grace, one meets the Perfect Guru. The Shabad
        dispels the spiritual ignorance within, and through the True Guru,
        one finds peace.  || 3 ||   The blind, self-willed manmukh acts
        blindly. He is in terrible trouble, and wanders in reincarnation.
        He can never snap the noose of Death, and in the end, he suffers
        in horrible pain.  || 4 ||   Through the Shabad, one's
        comings and goings in reincarnation are ended. He keeps the True
        Name enshrined within his heart. He dies in the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, and conquers his mind; stilling his egotism, he merges
        in the Lord.  || 5 ||   Coming and going, the people of the world
        are wasting away. Without the True Guru, no one finds permanence
        and stability. The Shabad shines its Light deep within the self,
        and one dwells in peace; one's light merges into the Light.
        || 6 ||   The five demons think of evil and corruption. The expanse
        is the manifestation of emotional attachment to Maya. Serving
        the True Guru, one is liberated, and the five demons are put under
        his control.  || 7 ||   Without the Guru, there is only the darkness
        of attachment. Over and over, time and time again, they  are drowned.
        Meeting the True Guru, Truth is implanted within, and the True
        Name becomes pleasing to the mind.  || 8 ||   True is His Door,
        and True is His Court, His Royal Darbaar. The true ones serve
        Him, through the Beloved Word of the Shabad. Singing the Glorious
        Praises of the True Lord, in the true melody, I am immersed and
        absorbed in Truth.  || 9 ||   Deep within the home of the self,
        one finds the home of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, one easily, intuitively finds it. There, one is not afflicted
        with sorrow or separation; merge into the Celestial Lord with
        intuitive ease.  || 10 ||   The evil people live in the love of
        duality. They wander around, totally attached and thirsty. They
        sit in evil gatherings, and suffer in pain forever; they earn
        pain, nothing but pain.  || 11 ||   Without the True Guru, there
        is no Sangat, no Congregation. Without the Shabad, no one can
        cross over to the other side. One who intuitively chants God's
        Glorious Praises day and night - his light merges into
        the Light.  || 12 ||   The body is the tree; the bird of the soul
        dwells within it. It drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, resting in
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. It never flies away, and
        it does not come or go; it dwells within the home of its own self.
        || 13 ||   Purify the body, and contemplate the Shabad. Remove
        the poisonous drug of emotional attachment, and eradicate doubt. <br>

      <p> The Giver of peace Himself bestows His Mercy, and unites us in
        Union with Himself.  || 14 ||   He is always near at hand; He
        is never far away. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        realize that He is very near. Your heart-lotus shall blossom forth,
        and the ray of God's Divine Light shall illuminate your
        heart; He shall be revealed to You.  || 15 ||   The True Lord
        is Himself the Creator. He Himself kills, and gives life; there
        is no other at all. O Nanak, through the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, glorious greatness is obtained. Eradicating self-conceit,
        peace is found.  || 16 || 2 || 24 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The Lord Lord Himself is the One who exalts
        and embellishes. Do not consider any other work. The True Lord
        abides deep within the heart of the Gurmukh, who intuitively merges
        in the True Lord.  || 1 ||   The True Lord dwells within the minds
        of all. By Guru's Grace, they are intuitively absorbed
        in Him. Calling out, &quot;Guru, Guru&quot;, I have found eternal
        peace; my consciousness is focused on the Guru's feet.
        || 2 ||   The True Guru is spiritual wisdom; the True Guru is
        worship and adoration. I serve the True Guru, and no other. From
        the True Guru, I have obtained the wealth, the jewel of the Naam.
        Service to the True Guru is pleasing to me.  || 3 ||   Without
        the True Guru, those who are attached to duality come and go,
        and wander in reincarnation; these unfortunate ones die. O Nanak,
        even after they are emancipated, those who become Gurmukh remain
        in the Guru's Sanctuary.  || 4 ||   The love of the Gurmukh
        is forever true. I beg for the invaluable Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, from the Guru. O Dear Lord, please be kind, and grant Your
        Grace; please keep me in the Guru's Sanctuary.  || 5 ||
        The True Guru trickles the Ambrosial Nectar into my mouth. My
        Tenth Gate has been opened and revealed. The unstruck sound current
        of the Shabad vibrates and resounds there, with the melody of
        the Guru's Bani; one is easily, intuitively absorbed in
        the Lord.  || 6 ||   Those who are so pre-ordained by the Creator,
        pass their nights and days calling on the Guru. Without the True
        Guru, no one understands; focus your consciousness on the Guru's
        Feet.  || 7 ||   The Lord Himself blesses those with whom He is
        pleased. The Gurmukh receives the wealth of the Naam. When the
        Lord grants His Grace, He bestows the Naam; Nanak is immersed
        and absorbed in the Naam.  || 8 ||   The jewel of spiritual wisdom
        is revealed within the mind. The wealth of the Naam is easily,
        intuitively received. This glorious greatness is obtained from
        the Guru; I am forever a sacrifice to the True Guru.  || 9 ||
        With the rising of the sun, the darkness of the night is dispelled.
        Spiritual ignorance is eradicated, by the priceless jewel of the
        Guru. The True Guru is the fantastically valuable jewel of spiritual
        wisdom; blessed by God's Mercy, peace is found.  || 10
        ||   The Gurmukh obtains the Naam, and his good reputation increases.
        Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds peace. He
        remains lovingly focused on the Naam.  || 11 ||   The Gurmukh
        receives the Naam. In intuitive peace he wakes, and in intuitive
        peace he sleeps. <br>

      <p> The Gurmukh is immersed and absorbed in the Naam; Nanak meditates
        on the Naam.  || 12 ||   The Ambrosial Nectar of the Guru's
        Bani is in the mouth of the devotees. The Gurmukhs chant and repeat
        the Lord's Name. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        their minds forever blossom forth; they focus their minds on the
        Lord's Feet.  || 13 ||   I am foolish and ignorant; I have
        no wisdom at all. From the True Guru, I have obtained understanding
        in my mind. O Dear Lord, please be kind to me, and grant Your
        Grace; let me be committed to serving the True Guru.  || 14 ||
        Those who know the True Guru realize the One Lord. The Giver
        of peace is all-pervading, permeating everywhere. Understanding
        my own soul, I have obtained the Supreme Status; my awareness
        is immersed in selfless service.  || 15 ||   Those who are blessed
        with glorious greatness by the Primal Lord God are lovingly focused
        on the True Guru, who dwells within their minds. The Giver of
        life to the world Himself meets them; O Nanak, they are absorbed
        in His Being.  || 16 || 1 ||   MARU,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord is
        inaccessible and unfathomable; He is eternal and imperishable.
        He dwells in the heart, and is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.
        There is no other Giver except Him; worship the Lord, O mortals.
        || 1 ||   No one can kill anyone who is saved by the Savior Lord.
        So serve such a Lord, O Saints, whose Bani is exalted and sublime.
        || 2 ||   When it seems that a place is empty and void, there,
        the Creator Lord is permeating and pervading. He causes the dried-up
        branch to blossom forth in greenery again; so meditate on the
        Lord - wondrous are His ways!  || 3 ||   The One who knows
        the anguish of all beings - unto that Lord and Master,
        I am a sacrifice. Offer your prayers to the One who is the Giver
        of all peace and joy.  || 4 ||   But one who does not know the
        state of the soul  - do not say anything to such an ignorant
        person. Do not argue with fools, O mortals. Meditate on the Lord,
        in the state of Nirvaanaa.  || 5 ||   Don't worry -
        let the Creator take care of it. The Lord gives to all creatures
        in the water and on the land. My God bestows His blessings without
        being asked, even to worms in soil and stones.  || 6 ||   Do not
        place your hopes in friends, children and siblings. Do not place
        your hopes in kings or the business of others. Without the Lord's
        Name, no one will be your helper; so meditate on the Lord, the
        Lord of the world.  || 7 ||   Night and day, chant the Naam. All
        your hopes and desires shall be fulfilled. O servant Nanak, chant
        the Naam, the Name of the Destroyer of fear, and your life-night
        shall pass in intuitive peace and poise.  || 8 ||   Those who
        serve the Lord find peace. They are intuitively absorbed in the
        Lord's Name. The Lord preserves the honor of those who
        seek His Sanctuary; go and consult the Vedas and the Puraanas.
        || 9 ||   That humble being is attached to the Lord's
        service, whom the Lord so attaches. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, doubt and fear are dispelled. In his own home, he remains
        unattached, like the lotus flower in the water. <br>

      <p> || 10 ||   One who serves in egotism is not accepted or approved.
        Such a person is born, only to die again, and come and go in reincarnation.
        Perfect is that penance and that service, which is pleasing to
        the Mind of my Lord.  || 11 ||   What Glorious Virtues of Yours
        should I chant, O my Lord and Master? You are the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of all souls. I beg for blessings from You, O Creator
        Lord; I repeat Your Name night and day.  || 12 ||   Some speak
        in egotistical power. Some have the power of authority and Maya.
        I have no other Support at all, except the Lord. O Creator Lord,
        please save me, meek and dishonored.  || 13 ||   You bless the
        meek and dishonored with honor, as it pleases You, O Lord. Many
        others argue in conflict, coming and going in reincarnation. Those
        people, whose side You take, O Lord and Master, are elevated and
        successful.  || 14 ||   Those who meditate forever on the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har, by Guru's Grace, obtain the supreme
        status. Those who serve the Lord find peace; without serving Him,
        they regret and repent.  || 15 ||   You are pervading all, O Lord
        of the world. He alone meditates on the Lord, upon whose forehead
        the Guru places His hand. Entering the Sanctuary of the Lord,
        I meditate on the Lord; servant Nanak is the slave of His slaves.

      <p> The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is in all places and
        interspaces. Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Perfect
        Transcendent Lord, I am rid of all anxieties and calculations.
        || 8 ||   One who has the Name of the Lord has hundreds of thousands
        and millions of arms. The wealth of the Kirtan of the Lord's

        sword of spiritual wisdom; I have attacked and killed the demons.
        || 9 ||   Chant the Chant of the Lord, the Chant of Chants. You
        shall not see the 8.4 million types of hell; sing His Glorious
        Praises and remain saturated with loving devotion  || 10 ||  
        He is the Savior of worlds and galaxies. He is lofty, unfathomable,
        inaccessible and infinite. That humble being, unto whom God grants
        His Grace, meditates on Him.  || 11 ||   God has broken my bonds,
        and united me with Himself. In His Mercy, He has made me the slave
        of His home. The unstruck celestial sound current resounds and
        vibrates, when one performs acts of true service.  || 12 ||  
        O God, I have enshrined faith in You within my mind. My egotistical
        intellect has been driven out. God has made me His own, and now
        I have a glorious reputation in this world.  || 13 ||   Proclaim
        His Glorious Victory, and meditate on the Lord of the Universe.

        delights. As a consequence of past actions, they have come together,
        enjoying pleasurable play. Whatever the husband does, the bride

        the husband comforts his wife.  || 2 ||   When the bride asks,
        the husband runs around in all sorts of ways. Whatever he finds,

      <p> When the Lord becomes Merciful, O Nanak, then in the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, the bride and the husband enjoy ecstasy
        and bliss.  || 5 ||   The body-bride is blind, and the groom is
        clever and wise. The creation was created of the five elements.
        That merchandise, for which you have come into the world, is received
        only from the True Guru.  || 6 ||   The body-bride says, &quot;Please
        live with me, O my beloved, peaceful, young lord. Without you,
        I am of no account. Please give me your word, that you will not
        leave me&quot;.  || 7 ||   The soul-husband says, &quot;I am
        the slave of my Commander. He is my Great Lord and Master, who
        is not dependent on anyone. As long as He keeps me, I will remain
        with Him. When He summons me, I shall arise and depart.&quot;
        || 8 ||   The husband speaks words of Truth to the bride, but
        the bride is restless and inexperienced, and she does not understand
        anything. Again and again, she begs her husband to stay; she thinks
        that he is just joking when he answers her.  || 9 ||   The Order
        comes, and the husband-soul is called. He does not consult with
        his bride, and does not ask her opinion. He gets up and marches
        off, and the discarded body-bride mingles with dust. O Nanak,
        behold the illusion of emotional attachment and hope.  || 10 ||
        O greedy mind - listen, O my mind! Serve the True Guru
        day and night forever. Without the True Guru, the faithless cynics
        rot away and die. The noose of Death is around the necks of those
        who have no guru.  || 11 ||   The self-willed manmukh comes, and
        the self-willed manmukh goes. The manmukh suffers beatings again
        and again. The manmukh endures as many hells as there are; the
        Gurmukh is not even touched by them.  || 12 ||   He alone is Gurmukh,
        who is pleasing to the Dear Lord. Who can destroy anyone who is
        robed in honor by the Lord? The blissful one is forever in bliss;
        he is dressed in robes of honor.  || 13 ||   I am a sacrifice
        to the Perfect True Guru. He is the Giver of Sanctuary, the Heroic
        Warrior who keeps His Word. Such is the Lord God, the Giver of
        peace, whom I have met; He shall never leave me or go anywhere
        else.  || 14 ||   He is the treasure of virtue; His value cannot
        be estimated. He is perfectly permeating each and every heart,
        prevailing everywhere. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Destroyer
        of the pains of the poor; I am the dust of the feet of Your slaves.

        are quenched, and one's inner being is cooled and soothed.
        The True Guru has mended the broken one. Awareness of the Word
        of the Shabad has awakened within my heart. Shaking it and vibrating
        it, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.  || 13 ||   I shall not die;
        I shall live forever and ever. I have become immortal; I am eternal

      <p> <font color="#000000">The Primal, Immaculate Lord God is formless.
        The Detached Lord is Himself prevailing in all. He has no race
        or social class, no identifying mark. By the Hukam of His Will,
        He created the entire universe.  || 1 ||   Out of all the 8.4
        million species of beings, God blessed mankind with glory. That
        human who misses this chance, shall suffer the pains of coming
        and going in reincarnation.  || 2 ||   What should I say, to one
        who has been created. The Gurmukh receives the treasure of the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. He alone is confused, whom the Lord
        Himself confuses. He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires
        to understand.  || 3 ||   This body has been made the village
        of joy and sorrow. They alone are emancipated, who seek the Sanctuary
        of the True Guru. One who remains untouched by the three qualities,
        the three gunas - such a Gurmukh is blessed with glory.
        || 4 ||   You can do anything, but whatever you do, only serves
        to tie your feet. The seed which is planted out of season does
        not sprout, and all one's capital and profits are lost.
        || 5 ||   In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises are most sublime and exalted. Become Gurmukh, chant and
        focus your meditation. <br>

      <p> You shall save yourself, and save all your generations as well.
        You shall go to the Court of the Lord with honor.  || 6 ||   All
        the continents, nether worlds, islands and worlds - God
        Himself has made them all subject to death. The One Imperishable
        Lord Himself is unmoving and unchanging. Meditating on Him, one
        becomes unchanging.  || 7 ||   The Lord's servant becomes
        like the Lord. Do not think that, because of his human body, he
        is different. The waves of the water rise up in various ways,
        and then the water merges again in water.  || 8 ||   A beggar
        begs for charity at His Door. When God pleases, He takes pity
        on him. Please bless me with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan,
        to satisfy my mind, O Lord. Through the Kirtan of Your Praises,
        my mind is held steady.  || 9 ||   The Beauteous Lord and Master
        is not controlled in any way. The Lord does that which pleases
        the Saints of the Lord. He does whatever they wish to be done;
        nothing blocks their way at His Door.  || 10 ||   Wherever the
        mortal is confronted with difficulty, there he should meditate
        on the Lord of the Universe. Where there are no children, spouse
        or friends, there the Lord Himself comes to the rescue.  || 11
        ||   The Great Lord and Master is inaccessible and unfathomable.
        How can anyone meet with God, the self-suficient One? Those who
        have had the noose cut away from around their necks, whom God
        has set back upon the Path, obtain a place in the Sangat, the
        Congregation.  || 12 ||   One who realizes the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command is said to be His servant. He endures both bad and good
        equally. When egotism is silenced, then one comes to know the
        One Lord. Such a Gurmukh intuitively merges in the Lord.  || 13
        ||   The devotees of the Lord dwell forever in peace. With a child-like,
        innocent nature, they remain detached, turning away from the world.
        They enjoy various pleasures in many ways; God caresses them,
        like a father caressing his son.  || 14 ||   He is inaccessible
        and unfathomable; His value cannot be estimated. We meet Him,
        only when He causes us to meet. The Lord is revealed to those
        humble Gurmukhs, who have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed
        upon their foreheads.  || 15 ||   You Yourself are the Creator
        Lord, the Cause of causes. You created the Universe, and You support
        the whole earth. Servant Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of Your Door,
        O Lord; if it is Your Will, please preserve his honor.  || 16

        are conscious of Your Creation. You Yourself established Yourself,

        You Yourself cherish and sustain each and every heart.  || 2 ||
        You created some to hold great and royal courts. Some turn away
        from the world in renunciation, and some maintain their households. </font><br>
