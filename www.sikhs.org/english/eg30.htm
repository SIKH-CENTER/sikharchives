      <p> Pause  ||   My body was afflicted with millions of diseases. They
        have been transformed into the peaceful, tranquil concentration
        of Samaadhi. When someone understands his own self, he no longer
        suffers from illness and the three fevers.  || 2 ||   My mind
        has now been restored to its original purity. When I became dead
        while yet alive, only then did I come to know the Lord. Says Kabeer,
        I am now immersed in intuitive peace and poise. I do not fear
        anyone, and I do not strike fear into anyone else.  || 3 || 17
        ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  When the body dies, where does the
        soul go? It is absorbed into the untouched, unstruck melody of
        the Word of the Shabad. Only one who knows the Lord realizes Him.
        The mind is satisfied and satiated, like the mute who eats the
        sugar candy and just smiles, without speaking.  || 1 ||   Such
        is the spiritual wisdom which the Lord has imparted. O mind, hold
        your breath steady within the central channel of the Sushmanaa.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Adopt such a Guru, that you shall not have
        to adopt another again. Dwell in such a state, that you shall
        never have to dwell in any other. Embrace such a meditation, that
        you shall never have to embrace any other. Die in such a way,
        that you shall never have to die again.  || 2 ||   Turn your breath
        away from the left channel, and away from the right channel, and
        unite them in the central channel of the Sushmanaa. At their confluence
        within your mind, take your bath there without water. To look
        upon all with an impartial eye  -  let this be your daily occupation.
        Contemplate this essence of reality  -  what else is there
        to contemplate?  || 3 ||   Water, fire, wind, earth and ether
        -  adopt such a way of life and you shall be close to the
        Lord. Says Kabeer, meditate on the Immaculate Lord. Go to that
        home, which you shall never have to leave.  || 4 || 18 ||   GAUREE,
        KABEER JEE,  TI-PADAS:  He cannot be obtained by offering your
        weight in gold. But I have bought the Lord by giving my mind to
        Him.  || 1 ||   Now I recognize that He is my Lord. My mind is
        intuitively pleased with Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Brahma spoke
        of Him continually, but could not find His limit. Because of my
        devotion to the Lord, He has come to sit within the home of my
        inner being.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, I have renounced my restless
        intellect. It is my destiny to worship the Lord alone.  || 3 ||
        1 || 19 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  That death which terrifies
        the entire world  -  the nature of that death has been revealed
        to me, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||  
        Now, how shall I die? My mind has already accepted death. Those
        who do not know the Lord, die over and over again, and then depart.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Everyone says, &quot;I will die, I will
        die.&quot; But he alone becomes immortal, who dies with intuitive
        understanding.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, my mind is filled with
        bliss; my doubts have been eliminated, and I am in ecstasy.  ||
        3 || 20 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  There is no special place where
        the soul aches; where should I apply the ointment? I have searched
        the body, but I have not found such a place.  || 1 ||   He alone
        knows it, who feels the pain of such love; the arrows of the Lord's
        devotional worship are so sharp!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I look
        upon all His soul-brides with an impartial eye; how can I know
        which ones are dear to the Husband Lord?  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer,
        one who has such destiny inscribed upon her forehead  -  her
        Husband Lord turns all others away, and meets with her.  || 3

      <p> GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  One who has the Lord as his Master, O Siblings
        of Destiny  -  countless liberations knock at his door.  ||
        1 ||   If I say now that my trust is in You alone, Lord, then
        what obligation do I have to anyone else?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        He bears the burden of the three worlds; why should He not cherish
        you also?  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, through contemplation, I have
        obtained this one understanding. If the mother poisons her own
        child, what can anyone do?  || 3 || 22 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:
        Without Truth, how can the woman be a true satee  -  a widow
        who burns herself on her husband's funeral pyre? O Pandit,
        O religious scholar, see this and contemplate it within your heart.
        || 1 ||   Without love, how can one's affection increase?
        As long as there is attachment to pleasure, there can be no spiritual
        love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who, in his own soul, believes
        the Queen Maya to be true, does not meet the Lord, even in dreams.
        || 2 ||   One who surrenders her body, mind, wealth, home and
        self  -  she is the true soul-bride, says Kabeer.  || 3 ||
        23 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  The whole world is engrossed in
        corruption. This corruption has drowned entire families.  || 1
        ||   O man, why have you wrecked your boat and sunk it? You have
        broken with the Lord, and joined hands with corruption.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Angels and human beings alike are burning in the
        raging fire. The water is near at hand, but the beast does not
        drink it in.  || 2 ||   By constant contemplation and awareness,
        the water is brought forth. That water is immaculate and pure,
        says Kabeer.  || 3 || 24 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  That family,
        whose son has no spiritual wisdom or contemplation  -  why
        didn't his mother just become a widow?  || 1 ||   That man
        who has not practiced devotional worship of the Lord  -  why
        didn't such a sinful man die at birth?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        So many pregnancies end in miscarriage  -  why was this one
        spared? He lives his life in this world like a deformed amputee.
        || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        beautiful and handsome people are just ugly hunch-backs.  || 3
        || 25 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  I am forever a sacrifice to those
        humble beings who take the Name of their Lord and Master.  ||
        1 ||   Those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Pure Lord are
        pure. They are my Siblings of Destiny, so dear to my heart.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   I am the dust of the lotus feet of those whose
        hearts are filled with the All-pervading Lord.  || 2 ||   I am
        a weaver by birth, and patient of mind. Slowly, steadily, Kabeer
        chants the Glories of God.  || 3 || 26 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:
        From the Sky of the Tenth Gate, the nectar trickles down, distilled
        from my furnace. I have gathered in this most sublime essence,
        making my body into firewood.  || 1 ||   He alone is called intoxicated
        with intuitive peace and poise, who drinks in the juice of the
        Lord's essence, contemplating spiritual wisdom.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Intuitive poise is the bar-maid who comes to serve
        it. I pass my nights and days in ecstasy.  || 2 ||   Through conscious
        meditation, I linked my consciousness with the Immaculate Lord.
        Says Kabeer, then I obtained the Fearless Lord.  || 3 || 27 ||
        GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  The natural tendency of the mind is to
        chase the mind. </p>

      <p> Who has established himself as a Siddha, a being of miraculous
        spiritual powers, by killing his mind?  || 1 ||   Who is that
        silent sage, who has killed his mind? By killing the mind, tell
        me, who is saved?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Everyone speaks through
        the mind. Without killing the mind, devotional worship is not
        performed.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, one who knows the secret of
        this mystery, beholds within his own mind the Lord of the three
        worlds.  || 3 || 28 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  The stars which
        are seen in the sky  -  who is the painter who painted them?
        || 1 ||   Tell me, O Pandit, what is the sky attached to? Very
        fortunate is the knower who knows this.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        The sun and the moon give their light; God's creative extension
        extends everywhere.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, he alone knows this,
        whose heart is filled with the Lord, and whose mouth is also filled
        with the Lord.  || 3 || 29 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  The Simritee
        is the daughter of the Vedas, O Siblings of Destiny. She has brought
        a chain and a rope.  || 1 ||   She has imprisoned the people in
        her own city. She has tightened the noose of emotional attachment
        and shot the arrow of death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By cutting,
        she cannot be cut, and she cannot be broken. She has become a
        serpent, and she is eating the world.  || 2 ||   Before my very
        eyes, she has plundered the entire world. Says Kabeer, chanting
        the Lord's Name, I have escaped her.  || 3 || 30 ||   GAUREE,
        KABEER JEE:  I have grasped the reins and attached the bridle;
        abandoning everything, I now ride through the skies.  || 1 ||
        I made self-reflection my mount, and in the stirrups of intuitive
        poise, I placed my feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Come, and let me
        ride you to heaven. If you hold back, then I shall strike you
        with the whip of spiritual love.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, those
        who remain detached from the Vedas, the Koran and the Bible are
        the best riders.  || 3 || 31 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  That mouth,
        which used to eat the five delicacies  -  I have seen the flames
        being applied to that mouth.  || 1 ||   O Lord, my King, please
        rid me of this one affliction: may I not be burned in fire, or
        cast into the womb again.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The body is destroyed
        by so many ways and means. Some burn it, and some bury it in the
        earth.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, O Lord, please reveal to me Your
        Lotus Feet; after that, go ahead and send me to my death.  ||
        3 || 32 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  He Himself is the fire, and
        He Himself is the wind. When our Lord and Master wishes to burn
        someone, then who can save him?  || 1 ||   When I chant the Lord's
        Name, what does it matter if my body burns? My consciousness remains
        absorbed in the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Who is
        burned, and who suffers loss? The Lord plays, like the juggler
        with his ball.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, chant the two letters of
        the Lord's Name  -  Raa Maa. If He is your Lord and Master,
        He will protect you.  || 3 || 33 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE,  DU-PADAS:
        I have not practiced Yoga, or focused my consciousness on meditation.
        Without renunciation, I cannot escape Maya.  || 1 ||   How have
        I passed my life? </p>

        Pause  ||   Says Kabeer, I have searched the skies, and have
        not seen another, equal to the Lord.  || 2 || 34 ||   GAUREE,
        KABEER JEE:  That head which was once embellished with the finest
        turban  -  upon that head, the crow now cleans his beak.  ||
        1 ||   What pride should we take in this body and wealth? Why
        not hold tight to the Lord's Name instead?  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Says Kabeer, listen, O my mind: this may be your fate as
        well!  || 2 || 35 ||  THIRTY-FIVE STEPS OF GAUREE GWAARAYREE.
        || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <center>
        RAAG GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  ASHTAPADEES OF KABEER JEE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> People beg for pleasure, but pain comes instead. I would rather
        not beg for that pleasure.  || 1 ||   People are involved in corruption,
        but still, they hope for pleasure. How will they find their home
        in the Sovereign Lord King?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Even Shiva and
        Brahma are afraid of this pleasure, but I have judged that pleasure
        to be true.  || 2 ||   Even sages like Sanak and Naarad, and the
        thousand-headed serpent, did not see the mind within the body.
        || 3 ||   Anyone can search for this mind, O Siblings of Destiny.
        When it escapes from the body, where does the mind go?  || 4 ||
        By Guru's Grace, Jai Dayv and Naam Dayv came to know this,
        through loving devotional worship of the Lord.  || 5 ||   This
        mind does not come or go. One whose doubt is dispelled, knows
        the Truth.  || 6 ||   This mind has no form or outline. By God's
        Command it was created; understanding God's Command, it will
        be absorbed into Him again.  || 7 ||   Does anyone know the secret
        of this mind? This mind shall merge into the Lord, the Giver of
        peace and pleasure.  || 8 ||   There is One Soul, and it pervades
        all bodies. Kabeer dwells upon this Mind.  || 9 || 1 || 36 ||
        GAUREE GWAARAYREE:  Those who are awake to the One Name, day
        and night  -  many of them have become Siddhas  -  perfect
        spiritual beings  -  with their consciousness attuned to the
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The seekers, the Siddhas and the silent
        sages have all lost the game. The One Name is the wish-fulfilling
        Elysian Tree, which saves them and carries them across.  || 1
        ||   Those who are rejuvenated by the Lord, do not belong to any
        other. Says Kabeer, they realize the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||
        37 ||   GAUREE AND ALSO SORAT'H:  O shameless being, don't
        you feel ashamed? You have forsaken the Lord  -  now where
        will you go? Unto whom will you turn?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One
        whose Lord and Master is the highest and most exalted  -  it
        is not proper for him to go to the house of another.  || 1 ||
        That Lord and Master is pervading everywhere. The Lord is always
        with us; He is never far away.  || 2 ||   Even Maya takes to the
        Sanctuary of His Lotus Feet. Tell me, what is there which is not
        in His home?  || 3 ||   Everyone speaks of Him; He is All-powerful.
        He is His Own Master; He is the Giver.  || 4 ||   Says Kabeer,
        he alone is perfect in this world, in whose heart there is none
        other than the Lord.  || 5 || 38 || </p>

      <p> Whose son is he? Whose father is he? Who dies? Who inflicts pain?
        || 1 ||   The Lord is the thug, who has drugged and robbed the
        whole world. I am separated from the Lord; how can I survive,
        O my mother?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whose husband is he? Whose
        wife is she? Contemplate this reality within your body.  || 2
        ||   Says Kabeer, my mind is pleased and satisfied with the thug.
        The effects of the drug have vanished, since I recognized the
        thug.  || 3 || 39 ||   Now, the Lord, my King, has become my help
        and support. I have cut away birth and death, and attained the
        supreme status.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He has united me with the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. He has rescued me from
        the five demons. I chant with my tongue and meditate on the Ambrosial
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. He has made me his own slave.  ||
        1 ||   The True Guru has blessed me with His generosity. He has
        lifted me up, out of the world-ocean. I have fallen in love with
        His Lotus Feet. The Lord of the Universe dwells continually within
        my consciousness.  || 2 ||   The burning fire of Maya has been
        extinguished. My mind is contented with the Support of the Naam.
        God, the Lord and Master, is totally permeating the water and
        the land. Wherever I look, there is the Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts.  || 3 ||   He Himself has implanted His devotional
        worship within me. By pre-ordained destiny, one meets Him, O my
        Siblings of Destiny. When He grants His Grace, one is perfectly
        fulfilled. Kabeer's Lord and Master is the Cherisher of the
        poor.  || 4 || 40 ||   There is pollution in the water, and pollution
        on the land; whatever is born is polluted. There is pollution
        in birth, and more pollution in death; all beings are ruined by
        pollution.  || 1 ||   Tell me, O Pandit, O religious scholar:
        who is clean and pure? Meditate on such spiritual wisdom, O my
        friend.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There is pollution in the eyes,
        and pollution in speech; there is pollution in the ears as well.
        Standing up and sitting down, one is polluted; one's kitchen
        is polluted as well.  || 2 ||   Everyone knows how to be caught,
        but hardly anyone knows how to escape. Says Kabeer, those who
        meditate on the Lord within their hearts, are not polluted.  ||
        3 || 41 ||   GAUREE:  Resolve this one conflict for me, O Lord,
        if you require any work from Your humble servant.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||  Is this mind greater, or the One to whom the mind is attuned?
        Is the Lord greater, or one who knows the Lord?  || 1 ||   Is
        Brahma greater, or the One who created Him? Are the Vedas greater,
        or the One from which they came?  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, I have
        become depressed; is the sacred shrine of pilgrimage greater,
        or the slave of the Lord?  || 3 || 42 ||   RAAG GAUREE CHAYTEE:
        Behold, O Siblings of Destiny, the storm of spiritual wisdom
        has come. It has totally blown away the thatched huts of doubt,
        and torn apart the bonds of Maya.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The two
        pillars of double-mindedness have fallen, and the beams of emotional
        attachment have come crashing down. The thatched roof of greed
        has caved in, and the pitcher of evil-mindedness has been broken.

        You should always be careful around those whom God has excluded
        from His devotional worship.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They do not
        offer even a handful of water, while they slander the one who
        brought forth the Ganges.  || 2 ||   Sitting down or standing
        up, their ways are crooked and evil. They ruin themselves, and
        then they ruin others.  || 3 ||   They know nothing except evil
        talk. They would not even obey Brahma's orders.  || 4 ||

      <p> He does not honor his ancestors while they are alive, but he holds
        feasts in their honor after they have died. Tell me, how can his

        at your very last moment, you shall suffer in terrible pain. You
        do not know the value of the Lord's Name; you shall drown
        in the terrifying world-ocean.  || 3 ||   You worship gods and
        goddesses, but you do not know the Supreme Lord God. Says Kabeer,
        you have not remembered the Lord who has no ancestors; you are
        clinging to your corrupt ways.  || 4 || 1 || 45 ||   GAUREE: 
        One who remains dead while yet alive, will live even after death;
        thus he merges into the Primal Void of the Absolute Lord. Remaining
        pure in the midst of impurity, he will never again fall into the
        terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||   O my Lord, this is the milk

        on the Primal Void of the Absolute Lord. Search for the One who
        does not come or go, who does not die and is not born, O renunciate.
        || 1 ||   My mind has turned away from the world, and is absorbed
        in the Mind of God. By Guru's Grace, my understanding has
        been changed; otherwise, I was totally ignorant.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   That which was near has become distant, and again, that
        which was distant is near, for those who realize the Lord as He

        Your speech, O Lord; it is beyond the three qualities. Is there

        ||   GAUREE:  There is no rainy season, ocean, sunshine or shade,
        no creation or destruction there. No life or death, no pain or
        pleasure is felt there. There is only the Primal Trance of Samaadhi,
        and no duality.  || 1 ||   The description of the state of intuitive
        poise is indescribable and sublime. It is not measured, and it
        is not exhausted. It is neither light nor heavy.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Neither lower nor upper worlds are there; neither day nor
        night are there. There is no water, wind or fire; there, the True
        Guru is contained.  || 2 ||   The Inaccessible and Unfathomable
        Lord dwells there within Himself; by Guru's Grace, He is
        found. Says Kabeer, I am a sacrifice to my Guru; I remain in the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 3 || 4 || 48 ||   GAUREE:
        With both sin and virtue, the ox of the body is purchased; the
        air of the breath is the capital which has appeared. The bag on
        its back is filled with desire; this is how we purchase the herd.
        || 1 ||   My Lord is such a wealthy merchant! He has made the
        whole world his peddler.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sexual desire and
        anger are the tax-collectors, and the waves of the mind are the
        highway robbers. The five elements join together and divide up
        their loot. This is how our herd is disposed of!  || 2 ||   Says
        Kabeer, listen, O Saints: This is the state of affairs now! Going
        uphill, the ox has grown weary; throwing off his load, he continues
        on his journey.  || 3 || 5 || 49 ||   GAUREE,  PANCH-PADAS:  For

        people do not know this.  || 1 ||   Tell me, why is the bride

        -  see this and understand. What can we say to her? What can
        the poor soul-bride do?  || 4 ||   Disappointed and hopeless,
        she gets up and departs. There is no support or encouragement

        GAUREE:  The Yogi says that Yoga is good and sweet, and nothing
        else is, O Siblings of Destiny. Those who shave their heads, and
        those who amputate their limbs, and those who utter only a single
        word, all say that they have attained the spiritual perfection
        of the Siddhas.  || 1 ||   Without the Lord, the blind ones are

        they themselves are bound by all sorts of chains.  || 1 ||  Pause

        when one leaves this path of errors. The scholarly Pandits, the
        virtuous, the brave and the generous, all assert that they alone
        are great.  || 2 ||   He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires
        to understand. Without understanding, what can anyone do? Meeting

        left and right hands, and grasp hold of the Feet of the Lord.

      <p> Where something existed, now there is nothing. The five elements
        are no longer there. The Ida, the Pingala and the Sushmanaa  - 
        O human being, how can the breaths through these be counted now?
        || 1 ||   The string has been broken, and the Sky of the Tenth
        Gate has been destroyed. Where has your speech gone? This cynicism
        afflicts me, night and day; who can explain this to me and help
        me understand?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Where the world is  - 
        the body is not there; the mind is not there either. The Joiner
        is forever unattached; now, within whom is the soul said to be
        contained?  || 2 ||   By joining the elements, people cannot join
        them, and by breaking, they cannot be broken, until the body perishes.
        Of whom is the soul the master, and of whom is it the servant?
        Where, and to whom does it go?  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, I have
        lovingly focused my attention on that place where the Lord dwells,
        day and night. Only He Himself truly knows the secrets of His
        mystery; He is eternal and indestructible.  || 4 || 1 || 52 ||
        GAUREE:  Let contemplation and intuitive meditation be your
        two ear-rings, and true wisdom your patched overcoat. In the cave
        of silence, dwell in your Yogic posture; let the subjugation of
        desire be your spiritual path.  || 1 ||   O my King, I am a Yogi,
        a hermit, a renunciate. I do not die or suffer pain or separation.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The solar systems and galaxies are my horn;

        world of form and substance.  || 4 || 2 || 53 ||   GAUREE:  Nine
        yards, ten yards, and twenty-one yards  -  weave these into
        the full piece of cloth; take the sixty threads and add nine joints
        to the seventy-two on the loom.  || 1 ||   Life weaves itself
        into its patterns. Leaving her home, the soul goes to the world
        of the weaver.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This cloth cannot be measured
        in yards or weighed with weights; its food is two and a half measures.
        If it does not obtain food right away, it quarrels with the master
        of the house.  || 2 ||   How many days will you sit here, in opposition
        to your Lord and Master? When will this opportunity come again?
        Leaving his pots and pans, and the bobbins wet with his tears,
        the weaver soul departs in jealous anger.  || 3 ||   The wind-pipe
        is empty now; the thread of the breath does not come out any longer.
        The thread is tangled; it has run out. So renounce the world of
        form and substance while you remain here, O poor soul; says Kabeer:
        you must understand this!  || 4 || 3 || 54 ||   GAUREE:  When
        one light merges into another, what becomes of it then? That person,
        within whose heart the Lord's Name does not well up  - 
        may that person burst and die!  || 1 ||   O my dark and beautiful
        Lord, my mind is attached to You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meeting
        with the Holy, the perfection of the Siddhas is obtained. What
        good is Yoga or indulgence in pleasures? When the two meet together,
        the business is conducted, and the link with the Lord's Name
        is established.  || 2 ||   People believe that this is just a
        song, but it is a meditation on God. It is like the instructions
        given to the dying man at Benares.  || 3 ||   Whoever sings or
        listens to the Lord's Name with conscious awareness  - 
        says Kabeer, without a doubt, in the end, he obtains the highest
        status.  || 4 || 1 || 4 || 55 ||   GAUREE:  Those who try to do
        things by their own efforts are drowned in the terrifying world-ocean;
        they cannot cross over. Those who practice religious rituals and
        strict self-discipline  -  their egotistical pride shall consume
        their minds.  || 1 ||   Your Lord and Master has given you the
        breath of life and food to sustain you; Oh, why have you forgotten
        Him? Human birth is a priceless jewel, which has been squandered
        in exchange for a worthless shell.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The thirst
        of desire and the hunger of doubt afflict you; you do not contemplate
        the Lord in your heart. Intoxicated with pride, you cheat yourself;
        you have not enshrined the Word of the Guru's Shabad within
        your mind.  || 2 ||   Those who are deluded by sensual pleasures,
        who are tempted by sexual delights and enjoy wine are corrupt.
        But those who, through destiny and good karma, join the Society
        of the Saints, float over the ocean, like iron attached to wood.
        || 3 ||   I have wandered in doubt and confusion, through birth
        and reincarnation; now, I am so tired. I am suffering in pain
        and wasting away. Says Kabeer, meeting with the Guru, I have obtained

        take this advice, O crazy mind. You have not meditated fearlessly
        on the Lord, O crazy mind; you have not embarked upon the Lord's
        Boat.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The monkey stretches out its hand,
        O crazy mind, and takes a handful of corn; now unable to escape,

        affairs of Maya. Like the weak dye of the safflower, O crazy mind,
        so is the expanse of this world of form and substance.  || 3 ||
        There are so many holy shrines in which to bathe, O crazy mind,
        and so many gods to worship. Says Kabeer, you shall not be saved

        release.  || 4 || 1 || 6 || 57 ||   GAUREE:  Fire does not burn
        it, and the wind does not blow it away; thieves cannot get near
        it. Accumulate the wealth of the Lord's Name; that wealth
        does not go anywhere.  || 1 ||   My wealth is God, the Lord of
        Wealth, the Lord of the Universe, the Support of the earth: this
        is called the most excellent wealth. The peace which is obtained
        by serving God, the Lord of the Universe  -  that peace cannot
        be found in kingdoms or power.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Shiva and
        Sanak, in their search for this wealth, became Udaasees, and renounced
        the world. One whose mind is filled with the Lord of liberation,
        and whose tongue chants the Name of the Lord, shall not be caught
        by the noose of Death.  || 2 ||   My own wealth is the spiritual
        wisdom and devotion given by the Guru; my mind is held steady
        in perfect neutral balance. It is like water for the burning soul,
        like an anchoring support for the wandering mind; the bondage
        of doubt and fear is dispelled.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer: O you
        who are intoxicated with sexual desire, reflect upon this in your
        heart, and see. Within your home there are hundreds of thousands,
        millions of horses and elephants; but within my home is the One
        Lord.  || 4 || 1 || 7 || 58 ||   GAUREE:  Like the monkey with
        a handful of grain, who will not let go because of greed  - 
        just so, all the deeds committed in greed ultimately become a
        noose around one's neck.  || 1 ||   Without devotional worship,
        human life passes away in vain. Without the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, without vibrating and meditating on the Lord
        God, one does not abide in Truth.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Like the
        flower which blossoms in the wilderness with no one to enjoy its
        fragrance, so do people wander in reincarnation; over and over
        again, they are destroyed by Death.  || 2 ||   This wealth, youth,
        children and spouse which the Lord has given you  -  this is
        all just a passing show. Those who are caught and entangled in
        these are carried away by sensual desire.  || 3 ||   Age is the
        fire, and the body is the house of straw; on all four sides, this
        play is being played out. Says Kabeer, to cross over the terriffying
        world-ocean, I have taken to the Shelter of the True Guru.  ||
        4 || 1 || 8 || 59 ||   GAUREE:  The water of the sperm is cloudy,

        of the body bursts.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, that single foundation
        which you have laid will be destroyed in an instant  -  you
        are so egotistical.  || 4 || 1 || 9 || 60 ||   GAUREE:  Just as
        Dhroo and Prahlaad meditated on the Lord, so should you meditate
        on the Lord, O my soul.  || 1 ||   O Lord, Merciful to the meek,
        I have placed my faith in You; along with all my family, I have
        come aboard Your boat.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When it is pleasing
        to Him, then He inspires us to obey the Hukam of His Command.
        He causes this boat to cross over.  || 2 ||   By Guru's Grace,
        such understanding is infused into me; my comings and goings in
        reincarnation have ended.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, meditate, vibrate
        upon the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth. In this world, in the
        world beyond and everywhere, He alone is the Giver.  || 4 || 2

        and Master.  || 1 ||   O my soul, sing the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You were upside-down, living in
        the womb; you generated the intense meditative heat of 'tapas'.
        Then, you escaped the fire of the belly.  || 2 ||   After wandering
        through 8.4 million incarnations, you came. If you stumble and
        fall now, you shall find no home or place of rest.  || 3 ||  
        Says Kabeer, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord, the Sustainer of
        the earth. He is not seen to be coming or going; He is the Knower
        of all.  || 4 || 1 || 11 || 62 ||   GAUREE POORBEE:  Don't

        hell. Whatever will be will be, so don't get your hopes up
        in your mind.  || 1 ||   Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        from whom the most excellent treasure is obtained.  || 1 ||  Pause

        at the sight of suffering and adversity. As is wealth, so is adversity;
        whatever the Lord proposes, comes to pass.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer,
        now I know that the Lord dwells within the hearts of His Saints;
        that servant performs the best service, whose heart is filled
        with the Lord.  || 4 || 1 || 12 || 63 ||   GAUREE:  O my mind,
        even if you carry someone's burden, they don't belong
        to you. This world is like the perch of the bird on the tree.
        || 1 ||   I drink in the sublime essence of the Lord. With the
        taste of this essence, I have forgotten all other tastes.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Why should we weep at the death of others, when
        we ourselves are not permanent? Whoever is born shall pass away;
        why should we cry out in grief?  || 2 ||   We are re-absorbed
        into the One from whom we came; drink in the Lord's essence,
        and remain attached to Him. Says Kabeer, my consciousness is filled
        with thoughts of remembrance of the Lord; I have become detached
        from the world.  || 3 || 2 || 13 || 64 ||   RAAG GAUREE:  The
        bride gazes at the path, and sighs with tearful eyes. <br>
