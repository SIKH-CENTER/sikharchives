      <p> Her heart is not happy, but she does not retrace her steps, in
        hopes of seeing the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
        || 1 ||   So fly away, black crow, so that I may quickly meet
        my Beloved Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Says Kabeer, to obtain
        the status of eternal life, worship the Lord with devotion. The
        Name of the Lord is my only Support; with my tongue, I chant the
        Lord's Name.  || 2 || 1 || 14 || 65 ||   RAAG GAUREE 11:
        All around, there are thick bushes of sweet basil, and there
        in the midst of the forest, the Lord is singing with joy. Beholding
        His wondrous beauty, the milk-maid was entranced, and said, &quot;Please
        don't leave me; please don't come and go!&quot;  ||
        1 ||   My mind is attached to Your Feet, O Archer of the Universe;
        he alone meets You, who is blessed by great good fortune.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   In Brindaaban, where Krishna grazes his cows,
        he entices and fascinates my mind. You are my Lord Master, the
        Archer of the Universe; my name is Kabeer.  || 2 || 2 || 15 ||
        66 ||   GAUREE POORBEE 12:  Many people wear various robes, but
        what is the use of living in the forest? What good does it do
        if a man burns incense before his gods? What good does it do to
        dip one's body in water?  || 1 ||   O soul, I know that I
        will have to depart. You ignorant idiot: understand the Imperishable
        Lord. Whatever you see, you will not see that again, but still,
        you cling to Maya.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The spiritual teachers,
        meditators and the great preachers are all engrossed in these
        worldly affairs. Says Kabeer, without the Name of the One Lord,
        this world is blinded by Maya.  || 2 || 1 || 16 || 67 ||   GAUREE
        12:  O people, O victims of this Maya, abandon your doubts and
        dance out in the open. What sort of a hero is one who is afraid
        to face the battle? What sort of satee is she who, when her time
        comes, starts collecting her pots and pans?  || 1 ||   Stop your
        wavering, O crazy people! Now that you have taken up the challenge
        of death, let yourself burn and die, and attain perfection.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The world is engrossed in sexual desire, anger
        and Maya; in this way it is plundered and ruined. Says Kabeer,
        do not forsake the Lord, your Sovereign King, the Highest of the
        High.  || 2 || 2 || 17 || 68 ||   GAUREE 13:  Your Command is
        upon my head, and I no longer question it. You are the river,
        and You are the boatman; salvation comes from You.  || 1 ||  
        O human being, embrace the Lord's meditation, whether your
        Lord and Master is angry with you or in love with you.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Your Name is my Support, like the flower blossoming
        in the water. Says Kabeer, I am the slave of Your home; I live
        or die as You will.  || 2 || 18 || 69 ||   GAUREE:  Wandering
        through 8.4 million incarnations, Krishna's father Nand was
        totally exhausted. Because of his devotion, Krishna was incarnated
        in his home; how great was the good fortune of this poor man!
        || 1 ||   You say that Krishna was Nand's son, but whose
        son was Nand himself? When there was no earth or ether or the
        ten directions, where was this Nand then?  || 1 || </p>

      <p> Pause  ||   He does not fall into misfortune, and He does not
        take birth; His Name is the Immaculate Lord. Kabeer's Lord
        is such a Lord and Master, who has no mother or father.  || 2
        || 19 || 70 ||   GAUREE:  Slander me, slander me  -  go ahead,
        people, and slander me. Slander is pleasing to the Lord's
        humble servant. Slander is my father, slander is my mother.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   If I am slandered, I go to heaven; the wealth
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within my mind. If my
        heart is pure, and I am slandered, then the slanderer washes my
        clothes.  || 1 ||   One who slanders me is my friend; the slanderer
        is in my thoughts. The slanderer is the one who prevents me from
        being slandered. The slanderer wishes me long life.  || 2 || 
        I have love and affection for the slanderer. Slander is my salvation.
        Slander is the best thing for servant Kabeer. The slanderer is
        drowned, while I am carried across.  || 3 || 20 || 71 ||   O my
        Sovereign Lord King, You are Fearless; You are the Carrier to
        carry us across, O my Lord King.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When I
        was, then You were not; now that You are, I am not. Now, You and
        I have become one; seeing this, my mind is content.  || 1 || 
        When there was wisdom, how could there be strength? Now that
        there is wisdom, strength cannot prevail. Says Kabeer, the Lord
        has taken away my wisdom, and I have attained spiritual perfection.
        || 2 || 21 || 72 ||   GAUREE:  He fashioned the body chamber
        with six rings, and placed within it the incomparable thing. He
        made the breath of life the watchman, with lock and key to protect
        it; the Creator did this in no time at all.  || 1 ||   Keep your
        mind awake and aware now, O Sibling of Destiny. You were careless,
        and you have wasted your life; your home is being plundered by
        thieves.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The five senses stand as guards
        at the gate, but now can they be trusted? When you are conscious
        in your consciousness, you shall be enlightened and illuminated.
        || 2 ||   Seeing the nine openings of the body, the soul-bride
        is led astray; she does not obtain that incomparable thing. Says
        Kabeer, the nine openings of the body are being plundered; rise
        up to the Tenth Gate, and discover the true essence.  || 3 ||
        22 || 73 ||   GAUREE:  O mother, I do not know any other, except
        Him. My breath of life resides in Him, whose praises are sung
        by Shiva and Sanak and so many others.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My
        heart is illuminated by spiritual wisdom; meeting the Guru, I
        meditate in the Sky of the Tenth Gate. The diseases of corruption,
        fear and bondage have run away; my mind has come to know peace
        in its own true home.  || 1 ||   Imbued with a balanced single-mindedness,
        I know and obey God; nothing else enters my mind. My mind has
        become fragrant with the scent of sandalwood; I have renounced
        egotistical selfishness and conceit.  || 2 ||   That humble being,
        who sings and meditates on the Praises of his Lord and Master,
        is the dwelling-place of God. He is blessed with great good fortune;
        the Lord abides in his mind. Good karma radiates from his forehead.
        || 3 ||   I have broken the bonds of Maya; the intuitive peace
        and poise of Shiva has dawned within me, and I am merged in oneness
        with the One. </p>

        RAAG GAUREE POORBEE,  BAAWAN AKHREE OF KABEER JEE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  TRUTH IS THE NAME. </p>
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  BY GURU'S GRACE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Through these fifty-two letters, the three worlds and all things
        are described. These letters shall perish; they cannot describe
        the Imperishable Lord.  || 1 ||   Wherever there is speech, there
        are letters. Where there is no speech, there, the mind rests on
        nothing. He is in both speech and silence. No one can know Him
        as He is.  || 2 ||   If I come to know the Lord, what can I say;
        what good does it do to speak? He is contained in the seed of
        the banyan-tree, and yet, His expanse spreads across the three
        worlds.  || 3 ||   One who knows the Lord understands His mystery,
        and bit by bit, the mystery disappears. Turning away from the
        world, one's mind is pierced through with this mystery, and
        one obtains the Indestructible, Impenetrable Lord.  || 4 ||  
        The Muslim knows the Muslim way of life; the Hindu knows the Vedas
        and Puraanas. To instruct their minds, people ought to study some
        sort of spiritual wisdom.  || 5 ||   I know only the One, the
        Universal Creator, the Primal Being. I do not believe in anyone
        whom the Lord writes and erases. If someone knows the One, the
        Universal Creator, he shall not perish, since he knows Him.  ||
        6 ||   KAKKA:  When the rays of Divine Light come into the heart-lotus,
        the moon-light of Maya cannot enter the basket of the mind. And
        if one obtains the subtle fragrance of that spiritual flower,
        he cannot describe the indescribable; he could speak, but who
        would understand?  || 7 ||   KHAKHA:  The mind has entered this
        cave. It does not leave this cave to wander in the ten directions.
        Knowing their Lord and Master, people show compassion; then, they
        become immortal, and attain the state of eternal dignity.  ||
        8 ||   GAGGA:  One who understands the Guru's Word does not
        listen to anything else. He remains like a hermit and does not
        go anywhere, when he grasps the Ungraspable Lord and dwells in
        the sky of the Tenth Gate.  || 9 ||   GHAGHA:  He dwells in each
        and every heart. Even when the body-pitcher bursts, he does not
        diminish. When someone finds the Path to the Lord within his own
        heart, why should he abandon that Path to follow some other path?
        || 10 ||   NGANGA:  Restrain yourself, love the Lord, and dismiss
        your doubts. Even if you do not see the Path, do not run away;
        this is the highest wisdom.  || 11 ||   CHACHA:  He painted the
        great picture of the world. Forget this picture, and remember
        the Painter. This wondrous painting is now the problem. Forget
        this picture and focus your consciousness on the Painter.  ||
        12 ||   CHHACHHA:  The Sovereign Lord of the Universe is here
        with you. Why are you so unhappy? Why don't you abandon your
        desires? O my mind, each and every moment I try to instruct you,
        but you forsake Him, and entangle yourself with others.  || 13
        ||   JAJJA:  If someone burns his body while he is still alive,
        and burns away the desires of his youth, then he finds the right
        way. When he burns his desire for his own wealth, and that of
        others, then he finds the Divine Light. </p>

      <p> || 14 ||   JHAJHA:  You are entangled in the world, and you do
        not know how to get untangled. You hold back in fear, and are
        not approved by the Lord. Why do you talk such nonsense, trying
        to convince others? Stirring up arguments, you shall only obtain
        more arguments.  || 15 ||   NYANYA:  He dwells near you, deep
        within your heart; why do you leave Him and go far away? I searched
        the whole world for Him, but I found Him near myself.  || 16 ||
        TATTA:  It is such a difficult path, to find Him within your
        own heart. Open the doors within, and enter the Mansion of His
        Presence. Beholding the Immovable Lord, you shall not slip and
        go anywhere else. You shall remain firmly attached to the Lord,
        and your heart will be happy.  || 17 ||   T'HAT'HA:
        Keep yourself far away from this mirage. With great difficulty,
        I have calmed my mind. That cheater, who cheated and devoured
        the whole world  -  I have cheated that cheater, and my mind
        is now at peace.  || 18 ||   DADDA:  When the Fear of God wells
        up, other fears depart. Other fears are absorbed into that Fear.
        When one rejects the Fear of God, then other fears cling to him.
        But if he becomes fearless, the fears of his heart run away. 
        || 19 ||   DHADHA:  Why do you search in other directions? Searching
        for Him like this, the breath of life runs out. When I returned
        after climbing the mountain, I found Him in the fortress  - 
        the fortress which He Himself made.  || 20 ||   NANNA:  The warrior
        who fights on the battle-field should keep up and press on. He
        should not yield, and he should not retreat. Blessed is the coming
        of one who conquers the one and renounces the many.  || 21 ||
        TATTA:  The impassable world-ocean cannot be crossed over; the
        body remains embroiled in the three worlds. But when the Lord
        of the three worlds enters into the body, then one's essence
        merges with the essence of reality, and the True Lord is attained.
        || 22 ||   T'HAT'HA:  He is Unfathomable; His depths
        cannot be fathomed. He is Unfathomable; this body is impermanent,
        and unstable. The mortal builds his dwelling upon this tiny space;
        without any pillars, he wishes to support a mansion.  || 23 ||
        DADDA:  Whatever is seen shall perish. Contemplate the One who
        is unseen. When the key is inserted in the Tenth Gate, then the
        Blessed Vision of the Merciful Lord's Darshan is seen.  ||
        24 ||   DHADHA:  When one ascends from the lower realms of the
        earth to the higher realms of the heavens, then everything is
        resolved. The Lord dwells in both the lower and higher worlds.
        Leaving the earth, the soul ascends to the heavens; then, the
        lower and higher join together, and peace is obtained.  || 25
        ||   NANNA:  The days and nights go by; I am looking for the Lord.
        Looking for Him, my eyes have become blood-shot. After looking
        and looking,when He is finally found, then the one who was looking
        merges into the One who was looked for.  || 26 ||   PAPPA:  He
        is limitless; His limits cannot be found. I have attuned myself
        to the Supreme Light. One who controls his five senses rises above
        both sin and virtue.  || 27 ||   FAFFA:  Even without the flower,
        the fruit is produced. One who looks at a slice of that fruit
        and reflects on it, will not be consigned to reincarnation. A
        slice of that fruit slices all bodies.  || 28 ||   BABBA:  When
        one drop blends with another drop, then these drops cannot be
        separated again. Become the Lord's slave, and hold tight
        to His meditation. </p>

      <p> If you turn your thoughts to the Lord, the Lord will take care
        of you like a relative.  || 29 ||   BHABHA:  When doubt is pierced,
        union is achieved. I have shattered my fear, and now I have come
        to have faith. I thought that He was outside of me, but now I
        know that He is within me. When I came to understand this mystery,
        then I recognized the Lord.  || 30 ||   MAMMA:  Clinging to the
        source, the mind is satisfied. One who knows this mystery understands
        his own mind. Let no one delay in uniting his mind. Those who
        obtain the True Lord are immersed in delight.  || 31 ||   MAMMA:
        The mortal's business is with his own mind; one who disciplines
        his mind attains perfection. Only the mind can deal with the mind;
        says Kabeer, I have not met anything like the mind.  || 32 ||
        This mind is Shakti; this mind is Shiva. This mind is the life
        of the five elements. When this mind is channeled, and guided
        to enlightenment, it can describe the secrets of the three worlds.
        || 33 ||   YAYYA:  If you know anything, then destroy your evil-mindedness,
        and subjugate the body-village. When you are engaged in the battle,
        don't run away; then, you shall be known as a spiritual hero.
        || 34 ||   RARRA:  I have found tastes to be tasteless. Becoming
        tasteless, I have realized that taste. Abandoning these tastes,
        I have found that taste. Drinking in that taste, this taste is
        no longer pleasing.  || 35 ||   LALLA:  Embrace such love for
        the Lord in your mind, that you shall not have to go to any other;
        you shall attain the supreme truth. And if you embrace love and
        affection for Him there, then you shall obtain the Lord; obtaining
        Him, you shall be absorbed in His Feet.  || 36 ||   WAWA:  Time
        and time again, dwell upon the Lord. Dwelling upon the Lord, defeat
        shall not come to you. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those,
        who sing the praises of the Saints, the sons of the Lord. Meeting
        the Lord, total Truth is obtained.  || 37 ||   WAWA:  Know Him.
        By knowing Him, this mortal becomes Him. When this soul and that
        Lord are blended, then, having been blended, they cannot be known
        separately.  || 38 ||   SASSA:  Discipline your mind with sublime
        perfection. Refrain from that talk which attracts the heart. The
        heart is attracted, when love wells up. The King of the three
        worlds is perfectly pervading and permeating there.  || 39 ||
        KHAKHA:  Anyone who seeks Him, and by seeking Him, finds Him,
        shall not be born again. When someone seeks Him, and comes to
        understand and contemplate Him, then he crosses over the terrifying
        world-ocean in an instant.  || 40 ||   SASSA:  The bed of the
        soul-bride is adorned by her Husband Lord; her skepticism is dispelled.
        Renouncing the shallow pleasures of the world, she obtains the
        supreme delight. Then, she is the soul-bride; He is called her
        Husband Lord.  || 41 ||   HAHA:  He exists, but He is not known
        to exist. When He is known to exist, then the mind is pleased
        and appeased. Of course the Lord exists, if one could only understand
        Him. Then, He alone exists, and not this mortal being.  || 42
        ||   Everyone goes around saying, &quot;I'll take this, and
        I'll take that.&quot; Because of that, they suffer in terrible
        pain. When someone comes to love the Lord of Lakhshmi, his sorrow
        departs, and he obtains total peace.  || 43 ||   KHAKHA:  Many
        have wasted their lives, and then perished. Wasting away, they
        do not remember the Lord, even now. But if someone, even now,
        comes to know the transitory nature of the world and restrain
        his mind, he shall find his permanent home, from which he was
        separated. </p>

      <p> || 44 ||   The fifty-two letters have been joined together. But
        people cannot recognize the One Word of God. Kabeer speaks the
        Shabad, the Word of Truth. One who is a Pandit, a religious scholar,
        must remain fearless. It is the business of the scholarly person
        to join letters. The spiritual person contemplates the essence
        of reality. According to the wisdom within the mind, says Kabeer,
        so does one come to understand.  || 45 || </p>

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> RAAG GAUREE,  T'HITEE ~ THE LUNAR DAYS OF KABEER JEE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> SHALOK:  There are fifteen lunar days, and seven days of the week.
        Says Kabeer, it is neither here nor there. When the Siddhas and
        seekers come to know the Lord's mystery, they themselves
        become the Creator; they themselves become the Divine Lord.  ||
        1 ||   T'HITEE:  On the day of the new moon, give up your
        hopes. Remember the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
        You shall attain the Gate of Liberation while yet alive. You shall
        come to know the Shabad, the Word of the Fearless Lord, and the
        essence of your own inner being.  || 1 ||   One who enshrines
        love for the Lotus Feet of the Lord of the Universe  -  by
        the Grace of the Saints, her mind becomes pure; night and day,
        she remains awake and aware, singing the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   On the first day of the lunar cycle,
        contemplate the Beloved Lord. He is playing within the heart;
        He has no body  -  He is Infinite. The pain of death never
        consumes that person who remains absorbed in the Primal Lord God.
        || 2 ||   On the second day of the lunar cycle, know that there
        are two beings within the fiber of the body. Maya and God are
        blended with everything. God does not increase or decrease. He
        is unknowable and immaculate; He does not change.  || 3 ||   On
        the third day of the lunar cycle, one who maintains his equilibrium
        amidst the three modes finds the source of ecstasy and the highest
        status. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, faith wells
        up. Outwardly, and deep within, God's Light is always radiant.
        || 4 ||   On the fourth day of the lunar cycle, restrain your
        fickle mind, and do not ever associate with sexual desire or anger.
        On land and sea, He Himself is in Himself. He Himself meditates
        and chants His Chant.  || 5 ||   On the fifth day of the lunar
        cycle, the five elements expand outward. Men are occupied in the
        pursuit of gold and women. How rare are those who drink in the
        pure essence of the Lord's Love. They shall never again suffer
        the pains of old age and death.  || 6 ||   On the sixth day of
        the lunar cycle, the six chakras run in six directions. Without
        enlightenment, the body does not remain steady. So erase your
        duality and hold tight to forgiveness, and you will not have to
        endure the torture of karma or religious rituals.  || 7 ||   On
        the seventh day of the lunar cycle, know the Word as True, and
        you shall be accepted by the Lord, the Supreme Soul. Your doubts
        shall be eradicated, and your pains eliminated, and in the ocean
        of the celestial void, you shall find peace.  || 8 ||   On the
        eighth day of the lunar cycle, the body is made of the eight ingredients.
        Within it is the Unknowable Lord, the King of the supreme treasure.
        The Guru, who knows this spiritual wisdom, reveals the secret
        of this mystery. Turning away from the world, He abides in the
        Unbreakable and Impenetrable Lord.  || 9 ||   On the ninth day
        of the lunar cycle, discipline the nine gates of the body. Keep
        your pulsating desires restrained. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Forget all your greed and emotional attachment; you shall live
        throughout the ages, eating the fruit of immortality.  || 10 ||
        On the tenth day of the lunar cycle, there is ecstasy in all
        directions. Doubt is dispelled, and the Lord of the Universe is
        met. He is the Embodiment of light, the incomparable essence.
        He is stainless, without stain, beyond both sunshine and shade.
        || 11 ||   On the eleventh day of the lunar cycle, if you run
        in the direction of the One, you will not have to suffer the pains
        of reincarnation again. Your body will become cool, immaculate
        and pure. The Lord was said to be far away, but He is found near
        at hand.  || 12 ||   On the twelfth day of the lunar cycle, twelve
        suns rise. Day and night, the celestial bugles vibrate the unstruck
        melody. Then, one beholds the Father of the three worlds. This
        is wonderful! The human being has become God!  || 13 ||   On the
        thirteenth day of the lunar cycle, the thirteen holy books proclaim
        that you must recognize the Lord in the nether regions of the
        underworld as well as the heavens. There is no high or low, no
        honor or dishonor. The Lord is pervading and permeating all. 
        || 14 ||   On the fourteenth day of the lunar cycle, in the fourteen
        worlds and on each and every hair, the Lord abides. Center yourself
        and meditate on truth and contentment. Speak the speech of God's
        spiritual wisdom.  || 15 ||   On the day of the full moon, the
        full moon fills the heavens. Its power is diffused through its
        gentle light. In the beginning, in the end, and in the middle,
        God remains firm and steady. Kabeer is immersed in the ocean of
        peace.  || 16 || </p>

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> RAAG GAUREE,  THE SEVEN DAYS OF THE WEEK OF KABEER JEE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord each and every day. Meeting
        with the Guru, you shall come to know the mystery of the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   On Sunday, begin the devotional worship
        of the Lord, and restrain the desires within the temple of the
        body. When your attention is focused day and night upon that imperishable
        place, then the celestial flutes play the unstruck melody in tranquil
        peace and poise.  || 1 ||   On Monday, the Ambrosial Nectar trickles
        down from the moon. Tasting it, all poisons are removed in an
        instant. Restrained by Gurbani, the mind remains indoors; drinking
        in this Nectar, it is intoxicated.  || 2 ||   On Tuesday, understand
        reality; you must know the way the five thieves work. Those who
        leave their own home to go out wandering shall feel the terrible
        wrath of the Lord, their King.  || 3 ||   On Wednesday, one's
        understanding is enlightened. The Lord comes to dwell in the lotus
        of the heart. Meeting the Guru, one comes to look alike upon pleasure
        and pain, and the inverted lotus is turned upright.  || 4 || 
        On Thursday, wash off your corruption. Forsake the trinity, and
        attach yourself to the One God. At the confluence of the three
        rivers of knowledge, right action and devotion, there, why not
        wash away your sinful mistakes?  || 5 ||   On Friday, keep up
        and complete your fast; day and night, you must fight against
        your own self. If you restrain your five senses, then you shall
        not cast your glance on another.  || 6 ||   On Saturday, keep
        the candle of God's Light steady within your heart; you will
        be enlightened, inwardly and outwardly. </p>

      </p>
      <p> All your karma will be erased. || 7 ||   Know that as long as
        you place your hopes in others, you shall not find the Mansion
        of the Lord's Presence. When you embrace love for the Lord,
        says Kabeer, then, you shall become pure in your very fiber.

      <p> God makes even stones float. So why shouldn't Your humble
        slave also float across, chanting Your Name, O Lord?  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   You saved the prostitute, and the ugly hunch-back;
        You helped the hunter and Ajaamal swim across as well. The hunter
        who shot Krishna in the foot  -  even he was liberated. I am
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those who chant the Lord's Name.
        || 1 ||   You saved Bidur, the son of the slave-girl, and Sudama;
        You restored Ugrasain to his throne. Without meditation, without
        penance, without a good family, without good deeds, Naam Dayv's
        Lord and Master saved them all.  || 2 || 1 || </p>

      </center>
      <p> The company I keep is wretched and low, and I am anxious day and
        night; my actions are crooked, and I am of lowly birth.  || 1
        ||   O Lord, Master of the earth, Life of the soul, please do
        not forget me! I am Your humble servant.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        Take away my pains, and bless Your humble servant with Your Sublime
        Love. I shall not leave Your Feet, even though my body may perish.
        || 2 ||   Says Ravi Daas, I seek the protection of Your Sanctuary;
        please, meet Your humble servant  -  do not delay!  || 3 ||
        1 ||   Baygumpura, 'the city without sorrow', is the
        name of the town. There is no suffering or anxiety there. There
        are no troubles or taxes on commodities there. There is no fear,
        blemish or downfall there.  || 1 ||   Now, I have found this most
        excellent city. There is lasting peace and safety there, O Siblings
        of Destiny.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God's Kingdom is steady,
        stable and eternal. There is no second or third status; all are
        equal there. That city is populous and eternally famous. Those
        who live there are wealthy and contented.  || 2 ||   They stroll
        about freely, just as they please. They know the Mansion of the
        Lord's Presence, and no one blocks their way. Says Ravi Daas,
        the emancipated shoe-maker: whoever is a citizen there, is a friend
        of mine.  || 3 || 2 || </p>

      <p> The path to God is very treacherous and mountainous, and all I
        have is this worthless ox. I offer this one prayer to the Lord,
        to preserve my capital.  || 1 ||   Is there any merchant of the
        Lord to join me? </p>

      </p>
      <p> My cargo is loaded, and now I am leaving.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        I am the merchant of the Lord; I deal in spiritual wisdom. I
        have loaded the Wealth of the Lord's Name; the world has
        loaded poison.  || 2 ||   O you who know this world and the world
        beyond: write whatever nonsense you please about me. The club
        of the Messenger of Death shall not strike me, since I have cast
        off all entanglements.  || 3 ||   Love of this world is like the
        pale, temporary color of the safflower. The color of my Lord's
        Love, however, is permanent, like the dye of the madder plant.

      <p> The frog in the deep well knows nothing of its own country or

        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, was Truth; in the Silver Age of
        Trayta Yuga, charitable feasts; in the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga,
        there was worship. In those three ages, people held to these three
        ways. But in the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, the Name of the Lord is
        your only Support.  || 1 ||   How can I swim across? No one has
        explained to me, so that I might understand how I can escape reincarnation.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So many forms of religion have been described;
        the whole world is practicing them. What actions will bring emancipation,
        and total perfection?  || 2 ||   One may distinguish between good
        and evil actions, and listen to the Vedas and the Puraanas, but
        doubt still persists. Skepticism continually dwells in the heart,
        so who can eradicate egotistical pride?  || 3 ||   Outwardly,
        he washes with water, but deep within, his heart is tarnished
        by all sorts of vices. So how can he become pure? His method of
        purification is like that of an elephant, covering himself with
        dust right after his bath!  || 4 ||   With the rising of the sun,
        the night is brought to its end; the whole world knows this. It
        is believed that with the touch of the Philosopher's Stone,
        copper is immediately transformed into gold.  || 5 ||   When one
        meets the Supreme Philosopher's Stone, the Guru, if such
        pre-ordained destiny is written on one's forehead, then the
        soul blends with the Supreme Soul, and the stubborn doors are
        opened wide.  || 6 ||   Through the way of devotion, the intellect
        is imbued with Truth; doubts, entanglements and vices are cut
        away. The mind is restrained, and one attains joy, contemplating
        the One Lord, who is both with and without qualities.  || 7 ||
        I have tried many methods, but by turning it away, the noose
        of doubt is not turned away. Love and devotion have not welled
        up within me, and so Ravi Daas is disillusioned and discouraged.
