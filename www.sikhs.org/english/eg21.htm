      <p> The Lord's Praises have saved His Saints and devotees. I
        have found God  -  I am not searching for any other.  || 7
        ||   The Guru has shown me the unseen Mansion of the True Lord.
        His Mansion is eternal and unchanging; it is not a mere reflection
        of Maya. Through truth and contentment, doubt is dispelled.  ||
        8 ||   That person, within whose mind the True Lord dwells  - 
        in his company, one becomes Gurmukh. O Nanak, the True Name washes
        off the pollution.  || 9 || 15 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST MEHL:  One
        whose consciousness is permeated with the Lord's Name  - 
        receive the blessing of his darshan in the early light of dawn.
        || 1 ||   If you do not meditate on the Lord, it is your own
        misfortune. In each and every age, the Great Giver is my Lord
        God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Following the Guru's Teachings,
        the perfect humble beings meditate on the Lord. Within their hearts,
        the unstruck melody vibrates.  || 2 ||   Those who worship the
        Lord and love the Lord  -  showering His Mercy, God protects
        them.  || 3 ||   Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord,
        Har, Har  -  gazing upon the blessed vision of their darshan,
        peace is obtained.  || 4 ||   Among all beings, the One Lord is
        pervading. The eogtistical, self-willed manmukhs wander in reincarnation.
        || 5 ||   They alone understand, who have found the True Guru.
        Subduing their ego, they receive the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        || 6 ||   How can anyone know of the Union between the being
        below and the Supreme Being above? The Gurmukhs obtain this Union;
        their minds are reconciliated.  || 7 ||   I am a worthless sinner,
        without merit. What merit do I have? When God showers His Mercy,
        servant Nanak is emancipated.  || 8 || 16 ||  SIXTEEN ASHTAPADEES

        GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FIRST MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> As the dairy farmer watches over and protects his cows, so does
        the Lord cherish and protect us, night and day. He blesses the
        soul with peace.  || 1 ||   Please protect me here and hereafter,
        O Lord, Merciful to the meek. I seek Your Sanctuary; please bless
        me with Your Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Wherever I
        look, there You are. Save me, O Savior Lord! You are the Giver,
        and You are the Enjoyer; You are the Support of the breath of
        life.  || 2 ||   According to the karma of past actions, people
        descend to the depths or rise to the heights, unless they contemplate
        spiritual wisdom. Without the Praises of the Lord of the Universe,
        the darkness is not dispelled.  || 3 ||   I have seen the world
        being destroyed by greed and egotism. Only by serving the Guru
        is God obtained, and the true gate of liberation found.  || 4
        ||   The Mansion of the Infinite Lord's Presence is within
        the home of one's own being. He is beyond any boundaries.
        Without the Word of the Shabad, nothing shall endure. Through
        understanding, peace is obtained.  || 5 ||   What have you brought,
        and what will you take away, when you are caught by the noose
        of Death? Like the bucket tied to the rope in the well, you are
        pulled up to the Akaashic Ethers, and then lowered down to the
        nether regions of the underworld.  || 6 ||   Follow the Guru's
        Teachings, and do not forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord; you
        shall automatically obtain honor. Deep within the self is the
        treasure of the Shabad; it is obtained only by eradicating selfishness
        and conceit.  || 7 ||   When God bestows His Glance of Grace,
        people settle in the Lap of the Virtuous Lord. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, this Union cannot be broken; the true profit is obtained.
        || 8 || 1 || 17 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST MEHL:  By Guru's Grace,
        one comes to understand, and then, the account is settled. In
        each and every heart is the Name of the Immaculate Lord; He is
        my Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   Without the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, no one is emancipated. See this, and reflect upon it.
        Even though you may perform hundreds of thousands of rituals,
        without the Guru, there is only darkness.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        What can you say, to one who is blind and without wisdom? Without
        the Guru, the Path cannot be seen. How can anyone proceed?  ||
        2 ||   He calls the counterfeit genuine, and does not know the
        value of the genuine. The blind man is known as an appraiser;
        this Dark Age of Kali Yuga is so strange!  || 3 ||   The sleeper
        is said to be awake, and those who are awake are like sleepers.
        The living are said to be dead, and no one mourns for those who
        have died.  || 4 ||   One who is coming is said to be going, and
        one who is gone is said to have come. That which belongs to others,
        he calls his own, but he has no liking for that which is his.
        || 5 ||   That which is sweet is said to be bitter, and the bitter
        is said to be sweet. One who is imbued with the Lord's Love
        is slandered  -  his is what I have seen in this Dark Age of
        Kali Yuga.  || 6 ||   He serves the maid, and does not see his
        Lord and Master. Churning the water in the pond, no butter is
        produced.  || 7 ||   One who understands the meaning of this verse
        is my Guru. O Nanak, one who knows his own self, is infinite and
        incomparable.  || 8 ||   He Himself is All-pervading; He Himself
        misleads the people. By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand,
        that God is contained in all.  || 9 || 2 || 18 || </p>

        RAAG GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  THIRD MEHL,  ASHTAPADEES:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The pollution of the mind is the love of duality. Deluded by doubt,
        people come and go in reincarnation.  || 1 ||   The pollution
        of the self-willed manmukhs will never go away, as long as they
        do not dwell on the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   All the created beings are contaminated by emotional
        attachment; they die and are reborn, only to die over and over
        again.  || 2 ||   Fire, air and water are polluted. The food which
        is eaten is polluted.  || 3 ||   The actions of those who do not
        worship the Lord are polluted. Attuned to the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, the mind becomes immaculate.  || 4 ||   Serving the
        True Guru, pollution is eradicated, and then, one does not suffer
        death and rebirth, or get devoured by death.  || 5 ||   You may
        study and examine the Shaastras and the Simritees, but without
        the Name, no one is liberated.  || 6 ||   Throughout the four
        ages, the Naam is the ultimate; reflect upon the Word of the Shabad.
        In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, only the Gurmukhs cross over. 
        || 7 ||   The True Lord does not die; He does not come or go.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains absorbed in the Lord.  || 8 || 1
        ||   GAUREE,  THIRD MEHL:  Selfless service is the support of
        the breath of life of the Gurmukh. Keep the Dear Lord enshrined
        in your heart. The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the True
        Lord.  || 1 ||   O Pandit, O religious scholar, read about the
        Lord, and renounce your corrupt ways. The Gurmukh crosses over
        the terrifying world-ocean. </p>

      </p>
      <p> || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Gurmukh eradicates egotism from within.
        No filth sticks to the Gurmukh. The Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        comes to dwell within the mind of the Gurmukh.  || 2 ||   Through
        karma and Dharma, good actions and righteous faith, the Gurmukh
        becomes true. The Gurmukh burns away egotism and duality. The
        Gurmukh is attuned to the Naam, and is at peace.  || 3 ||   Instruct
        your own mind, and understand Him. You may preach to other people,
        but no one will listen. The Gurmukh understands, and is always
        at peace.  || 4 ||   The self-willed manmukhs are such clever
        hypocrites. No matter what they do, it is not acceptable. They
        come and go in reincarnation, and find no place of rest.  || 5
        ||   The manmukhs perform their rituals, but they are totally
        selfish and conceited. They sit there, like storks, pretending
        to meditate. Caught by the Messenger of Death, they shall regret
        and repent in the end.  || 6 ||   Without serving the True Guru,
        liberation is not obtained. By Guru's Grace, one meets the
        Lord. The Guru is the Great Giver, throughout the four ages. 
        || 7 ||   For the Gurmukh, the Naam is social status, honor and
        glorious greatness. Maya, the daughter of the ocean, has been
        slain. O Nanak, without the Name, all clever tricks are false.
        || 8 || 2 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD MEHL:  Learn the Dharma of this
        age, O Siblings of Destiny; all understanding is obtained from
        the Perfect Guru. Here and hereafter, the Lord's Name is
        our Companion.  || 1 ||   Learn of the Lord, and contemplate Him
        in your mind. By Guru's Grace, your filth shall be washed
        away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Through argument and debate, He cannot
        be found. The mind and body are made insipid through the love
        of duality. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, lovingly
        attune yourself to the True Lord.  || 2 ||   This world is polluted
        with egotism. By taking cleansing baths daily at sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage, egotism is not eliminated. Without meeting the
        Guru, they are tortured by Death.  || 3 ||   Those humble beings
        are true, who conquer their ego. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, they conquer the five thieves. They save themselves, and
        save all their generations as well.  || 4 ||   The Actor has staged
        the drama of emotional attachment to Maya. The self-willed manmukhs
        cling blindly to it. The Gurmukhs remain detached, and lovingly
        attune themselves to the Lord.  || 5 ||   The disguisers put on
        their various disguises. Desire rages within them, and they carry
        on egotistically. They do not understand themselves, and they
        lose the game of life.  || 6 ||   Putting on religious robes,
        they act so clever, but they are totally deluded by doubt and
        emotional attachment to Maya. Without serving the Guru, they suffer
        in terrible pain.  || 7 ||   Those who are attuned to the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, remain detached forever. Even as householders,
        they lovingly attune themselves to the True Lord. O Nanak, those
        who serve the True Guru are blessed and very fortunate.  || 8
        || 3 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD MEHL:  Brahma is the founder of the study
        of the Vedas. From him emanated the gods, enticed by desire. They
        wander in the three qualities, and they do not dwell within their
        own home.  || 1 ||   The Lord has saved me; I have met the True
        Guru. He has implanted devotional worship of the Lord's Name,
        night and day.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The songs of Brahma entangle
        people in the three qualities. </p>

      <p> Reading about the debates and disputes, they are hit over the
        head by the Messenger of Death. They do not understand the essence
        of reality, and they gather their worthless bundles of straw.
        || 2 ||   The self-willed manmukhs, in ignorance, take the path
        of evil. They forget the Lord's Name, and in its place, they
        establish all sorts of rituals. They drown in the terrifying world-ocean,
        in the love of duality.  || 3 ||   Driven crazy, infatuated by
        Maya, they call themselves Pandits  -  religious scholars;
        stained with corruption, they suffer terrible pain. The noose
        of the Messenger of Death is around their necks; they are constantly
        tormented by death.  || 4 ||   The Messenger of Death does not
        even approach the Gurmukhs. Through the Word of the Shabad, they
        burn away their ego and duality. Attuned to the Name, they sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 5 ||   Maya is the slave
        of the Lord's devotees; it works for them. One who falls
        at their feet attains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
        He is forever immaculate; he is absorbed in intuitive peace. 
        || 6 ||   Those who listen to the Lord's Sermon are seen
        to be the wealthy people in this world. Everyone bows down to
        them, and adores them, night and day. They intuitively savor the
        Glories of the True Lord within their minds.  || 7 ||   The Perfect
        True Guru has revealed the Shabad; it eradicates the three qualities,
        and attunes the consciousness to the fourth state. O Nanak, subduing
        egotism, one is absorbed into God.  || 8 || 4 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Brahma studied the Vedas, but these lead only to debates
        and disputes. He is filled with darkness; he does not understand
        himself. And yet, if he chants the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        he finds God.  || 1 ||   So serve the Guru, and you shall not
        be consumed by death. The self-willed manmukhs have been consumed
        by the love of duality.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Becoming Gurmukh,
        the sinful mortals are purified. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, they find intuitive peace and poise deep within. I have
        found my God, through the Guru's Shabad, and I have been
        reformed.  || 2 ||   God Himself unites us in Union with the True
        Guru, when we become pleasing to the Mind of my True God. They
        sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, in the poise of celestial
        peace.  || 3 ||   Without the True Guru, they are deluded by doubt.
        The blind, self-willed manmukhs constantly eat poison. They are
        beaten by the Messenger of Death with his rod, and they suffer
        in constant pain.  || 4 ||   The Messenger of Death does not catch
        sight of those who enter the Sanctuary of the Lord. Subduing egotism,
        they lovingly center their consciousness on the True Lord. They
        keep their consciousness constantly focused on the Lord's
        Name.  || 5 ||   Those humble beings who serve the True Guru are
        pure and immaculate. Merging their minds into the Mind, they conquer
        the entire world. In this way, you too shall find happiness, O
        my friend.  || 6 ||   Those who serve the True Guru are blessed
        with fruitful rewards. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides
        in their hearts; selfishness and conceit depart from within them.
        The unstruck melody of the Shabad vibrates for them.  || 7 ||
        Who  -  who has not been purified by the True Guru, O my
        Siblings of Destiny? The devotees are purified, and honored in
        His Court. O Nanak, greatness is in the Lord's Name.  ||
        8 || 5 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who speak of the three
        qualities  -  their doubts do not depart. Their bonds are not
        broken, and they do not obtain liberation. The True Guru is the
        Bestower of liberation in this age.  || 1 ||   Those mortals who
        become Gurmukh give up their doubts. The celestial music wells
        up, when they lovingly attune their consciousness to the Lord.

      <p> Those who are controlled by the three qualities have death hovering
        over their heads. They do not remember the Name of the Creator
        Lord. They die, and are reborn, over and over, again and again.
        || 2 ||   Those whose guru is spiritually blind  -  their
        doubts are not dispelled. Abandoning the Source of all, they have
        become attached to the love of duality. Infected with poison,
        they are immersed in poison.  || 3 ||   Believing Maya to be the
        source of all, they wander in doubt. They have forgotten the Dear
        Lord, and they are in love with duality. The supreme status is
        obtained only by those who are blessed with His Glance of Grace.
        || 4 ||   One who has Truth pervading within, radiates Truth
        outwardly as well. The Truth does not remain hidden, even though
        one may try to hide it. The spiritually wise know this intuitively.
        || 5 ||   The Gurmukhs keep their consciousness lovingly centered
        on the Lord. Ego and Maya are burned away by the Word of the Shabad.
        My True God unites them in His Union.  || 6 ||   The True Guru,
        The Giver, preaches the Shabad. He controls, and restrains, and
        holds still the wandering mind. Understanding is obtained through
        the Perfect Guru.  || 7 ||   The Creator Himself has created the
        universe; He Himself shall destroy it. Without Him, there is no
        other at all. O Nanak, how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand
        this!  || 8 || 6 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukhs obtain
        the Naam, the Priceless Name of the Lord. They serve the Name,
        and through the Name, they are absorbed in intuitive peace and
        poise. With their tongues, they continually sing the Ambrosial
        Naam. They obtain the Lord's Name; the Lord showers His Mercy
        upon them.  || 1 ||   Night and day, within your heart, meditate
        on the Lord of the Universe. The Gurmukhs obtain the supreme state
        of peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Peace comes to fill the hearts
        of those who, as Gurmukh, sing of the True Lord, the treasure
        of excellence. They become the constant slaves of the slaves of
        the Lord's slaves. Within their households and families,
        they remain always detached.  || 2 ||   How rare are those who,
        as Gurmukh, become Jivan Mukta  -  liberated while yet alive.
        They alone obtain the supreme treasure. Eradicating the three
        qualities, they become pure. They are intuitively absorbed in
        the True Lord God.  || 3 ||   Emotional attachment to family does
        not exist, when the True Lord abides within the heart. The mind
        of the Gurmukh is pierced through and held steady. One who recognizes
        the Hukam of the Lord's Command understands the True Lord.
        || 4 ||   You are the Creator Lord  -  there is no other for
        me. I serve You, and through You, I obtain honor. God showers
        His Mercy, and I sing His Praises. The light of the jewel of the
        Naam permeates the entire world.  || 5 ||   To the Gurmukhs, the
        Word of God's Bani seems so sweet. Deep within, their hearts
        blossom forth; night and day, they lovingly center themselves
        on the Lord. The True Lord is intuitively obtained, by His Grace.
        The True Guru is obtained by the destiny of perfect good fortune.

      <p> The mind is attuned to the Word of the Shabad; it is lovingly
        attuned to the Lord. It abides within its own home, in harmony

        free of desire, when it experiences the Fear of God, through the

        By Guru's Grace, one is united in His Union.  || 2 ||   The
        slave of the Lord's slave attains peace. My Lord God is found

        the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 ||   Cursed,
        cursed is that home and family, in which the love of the Lord

        I came to understand my body. The fires of ego and desire have
        been totally quenched. Anger has been dispelled, and I have grasped
        hold of tolerance.  || 7 ||   The Lord Himself showers His Mercy,
        and bestows the Naam. How rare is that Gurmukh, who receives the

        away from the True Guru; they continue to wander aimlessly. They
        are not accepted by the earth or the sky; they fall into manure,

        to answer for your account, the Lord Himself shall release you.
        || 2 ||   O camel-like mind, you were once very pure; the filth
        of egotism has now attached itself to you. Your Beloved Husband

        and find the palace of love; meet the Guru, and meet the Lord.
        || 5 ||   O camel-like mind, you are my friend; abandon hypocrisy

        away this pollution.  || 7 ||   O my dear beloved camel-like mind,

        to Maya is so pervasive. Ultimately, nothing shall go along with
        anyone.  || 8 ||   O camel-like mind, my good friend, take the
        supplies of the Lord's Name, and obtain honor. In the Court
        of the Lord, you shall be robed with honor, and the Lord Himself
        shall embrace you.  || 9 ||   O camel-like mind, one who surrenders

        To know the way, through the Guru, is equal to millions of rewards.
        || 3 ||   Within your mind, over and over again, think of Him,
        and your love of Maya shall depart. The Imperishable Lord is always
        with you. O my mind, immerse yourself in the Love of the Lord.
        || 4 ||   Working for Him, all hunger departs. Working for Him,
        the Messenger of Death will not be watching you. Working for Him,
        you shall obtain glorious greatness. Working for Him, you shall
        become immortal.  || 5 ||   His servant does not suffer punishment.
        His servant suffers no loss. In His Court, His servant does not
        have to answer for his account. So serve Him with distinction.
        || 6 ||   He is not lacking in anything. He Himself is One, although
        He appears in so many forms. By His Glance of Grace, you shall
        be happy forever. So work for Him, O my mind.  || 7 ||   No one
        is clever, and no one is foolish. No one is weak, and no one is
        a hero. <br>
