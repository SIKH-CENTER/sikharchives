      <p> He came and he went, and now, even his name has died. After he
        left, food was offered on leaves, and the birds were called to
        come and eat. O Nanak, the self-willed manmukhs love the darkness.
        Without the Guru, the world is drowning.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        At the age of ten, he is a child; at twenty, a youth, and at
        thirty, he is called handsome. At forty, he is full of life; at
        fifty, his foot slips, and at sixty, old age is upon him. At seventy,
        he loses his intellect, and at eighty, he cannot perform his duties.
        At ninety, he lies in his bed, and he cannot understand his weakness.
        After seeking and searching for such a long time, O Nanak, I have
        seen that the world is just a mansion of smoke.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:
        You, O Creator Lord, are Unfathomable. You Yourself created the
        Universe, its colors, qualities and varieties, in so many ways
        and forms. You created it, and You alone understand it. It is
        all Your Play. Some come, and some arise and depart; but without
        the Name, all are bound to die. The Gurmukhs are imbued with the
        deep crimson color of the poppy; they are dyed in the color of
        the Lord's Love. So serve the True and Pure Lord, the Supremely
        Powerful Architect of Destiny. You Yourself are All-knowing. O
        Lord, You are the Greatest of the Great! O my True Lord, I am
        a sacrifice, a humble sacrifice, to those who meditate on You
        within their conscious mind.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL: 
        He placed the soul in the body which He had fashioned. He protects
        the Creation which He has created. With their eyes, they see,
        and with their tongues, they speak; with their ears, they bring
        the mind to awareness. With their feet, they walk, and with their
        hands, they work; they wear and eat whatever is given. They do
        not know the One who created the Creation. The blind fools do
        their dark deeds. When the pitcher of the body breaks and shatters
        into pieces, it cannot be re-created again. O Nanak, without the
        Guru, there is no honor; without honor, no one is carried across.
        || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  They prefer the gift, instead of the
        Giver; such is the way of the self-willed manmukhs. What can anyone
        say about their intelligence, their understanding or their cleverness?
        The deeds which one commits, while sitting in one's own home,
        are known far and wide, in the four directions. One who lives
        righteously is known as righteous; one who commits sins is known
        as a sinner. You Yourself enact the entire play, O Creator. Why
        should we speak of any other? As long as Your Light is within
        the body, You speak through that Light. Without Your Light, who
        can do anything? Show me any such cleverness! O Nanak, the Lord
        alone is Perfect and All-knowing; He is revealed to the Gurmukh.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself
        put it to work. Administering the drug of emotional attachment,
        You Yourself have led the world astray. The fire of desire is
        deep within; unsatisfied, people remain hungry and thirsty. This
        world is an illusion; it dies and it is re-born - it comes
        and it goes in reincarnation. Without the True Guru, emotional
        attachment is not broken. All have grown weary of performing empty
        rituals. Those who follow the Guru's Teachings meditate on
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Filled with a joyful peace, they
        surrender to Your Will. </p>

      <p> They save their families and ancestors; blessed are the mothers
        who gave birth to them. Beautiful and sublime is the glory and
        the understanding of those who focus their consciousness on the
        Lord.  || 2 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  To see without eyes; to
        hear without ears; to walk without feet; to work without hands;
        to speak without a tongue - like this, one remains dead while
        yet alive. O Nanak, recognize the Hukam of the Lord's Command,
        and merge with your Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL: 
        He is seen, heard and known, but His subtle essence is not obtained.
        How can the lame, armless and blind person run to embrace the
        Lord? Let the Fear of God be your feet, and let His Love be your
        hands; let His Understanding be your eyes. Says Nanak, in this
        way, O wise soul-bride, you shall be united with your Husband
        Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Forever and ever, You are the only One;
        You set the play of duality in motion. You created egotism and
        arrogant pride, and You placed greed within our beings. Keep me
        as it pleases Your Will; everyone acts as You cause them to act.
        Some are forgiven, and merge with You; through the Guru's
        Teachings, we are joined to You. Some stand and serve You; without
        the Name, nothing else pleases them. Any other task would be worthless
        to them - You have enjoined them to Your True Service. In the
        midst of children, spouse and relations, some still remain detached;
        they are pleasing to Your Will. Inwardly and outwardly, they are
        pure, and they are absorbed in the True Name.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,
        FIRST MEHL:  I may make a cave, in a mountain of gold, or in
        the water of the nether regions; I may remain standing on my head,
        upside-down, on the earth or up in the sky; I may totally cover
        my body with clothes, and wash them continually; I may shout out
        loud, the white, red, yellow and black Vedas; I may even live
        in dirt and filth. And yet, all this is just a product of evil-mindedness,
        and intellectual corruption. I was not, I am not, and I will never
        be anything at all! O Nanak, I dwell only on the Word of the Shabad.
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  They wash their clothes, and scrub their
        bodies, and try to practice self-discipline. But they are not
        aware of the filth staining their inner being, while they try
        and try to wash off the outer dirt. The blind go astray, caught
        by the noose of Death. They see other people's property as
        their own, and in egotism, they suffer in pain. O Nanak, the egotism
        of the Gurmukhs is broken, and then, they meditate on the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har. They chant the Naam, meditate on the Naam,
        and through the Naam, they are absorbed in peace.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Destiny has brought together and united the body and the soul-swan.
        He who created them, also separates them. The fools enjoy their
        pleasures; they must also endure all their pains. From pleasures,
        arise diseases and the commission of sins. From sinful pleasures
        come sorrow, separation, birth and death. The fools try to account
        for their misdeeds, and argue uselessly. The judgement is in the
        Hands of the True Guru, who puts an end to the argument. Whatever
        the Creator does, comes to pass. It cannot be changed by anyone's
        efforts.  || 4 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Telling lies, they eat
        dead bodies. </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>

      </p>
      <p> And yet, they go out to teach others. They are deceived, and they
        deceive their companions. O Nanak, such are the leaders of men.
        || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Those, within whom the Truth dwells,
        obtain the True Name; they speak only the Truth. They walk on
        the Lord's Path, and inspire others to walk on the Lord's
        Path as well. Bathing in a pool of holy water, they are washed
        clean of filth. But, by bathing in a stagnant pond, they are contaminated
        with even more filth. The True Guru is the Perfect Pool of Holy
        Water. Night and day, He meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har. He is saved, along with his family; bestowing the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, He saves the whole world. Servant Nanak is
        a sacrifice to one who himself chants the Naam, and inspires others
        to chant it as well.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Some pick and eat fruits
        and roots, and live in the wilderness. Some wander around wearing
        saffron robes, as Yogis and Sanyaasees. But there is still so
        much desire within them - they still yearn for clothes and
        food. They waste their lives uselessly; they are neither householders
        nor renunciates. The Messenger of Death hangs over their heads,
        and they cannot escape the three-phased desire. Death does not
        even approach those who follow the Guru's Teachings, and
        become the slaves of the Lord's slaves. The True Word of
        the Shabad abides in their true minds; within the home of their
        own inner beings, they remain detached. O Nanak, those who serve
        their True Guru, rise from desire to desirelessness.  || 5 ||
        SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  If one's clothes are stained with
        blood, the garment becomes polluted. Those who suck the blood
        of human beings - how can their consciousness be pure? O Nanak,
        chant the Name of God, with heart-felt devotion. Everything else
        is just a pompous worldly show, and the practice of false deeds.
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Since I am no one, what can I say? Since
        I am nothing, what can I be? As He created me, so I act. As He
        causes me to speak, so I speak. I am full and overflowing with
        sins - if only I could wash them away! I do not understand
        myself, and yet I try to teach others. Such is the guide I am!
        O Nanak, the one who is blind shows others the way, and misleads
        all his companions. But, going to the world hereafter, he shall
        be beaten and kicked in the face; then, it will be obvious, what
        sort of guide he was!  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Through all the months
        and the seasons, the minutes and the hours, I dwell upon You,
        O Lord. No one has attained You by clever calculations, O True,
        Unseen and Infinite Lord. That scholar who is full of greed, arrogant
        pride and egotism, is known to be a fool. So read the Name, and
        realize the Name, and contemplate the Guru's Teachings. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, I have earned the wealth of the Naam;
        I possess the storehouses, overflowing with devotion to the Lord.
        Believing in the Immaculate Naam, one is hailed as true, in the
        True Court of the Lord. The Divine Light of the Infinite Lord,
        who owns the soul and the breath of life, is deep within the inner
        being. You alone are the True Banker, O Lord; the rest of the
        world is just Your petty trader.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        Let mercy be your mosque, faith your prayer-mat, and honest living
        your Koran. Make modesty your circumcision, and good conduct your
        fast. In this way, you shall be a true Muslim. Let good conduct
        be your Kaabaa, Truth your spiritual guide, and the karma of good
        deeds your prayer and chant. Let your rosary be that which is
        pleasing to His Will. </p>

      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, God shall preserve your honor.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        To take what rightfully belongs to another, is like a Muslim
        eating pork, or a Hindu eating beef. Our Guru, our Spiritual Guide,
        stands by us, if we do not eat those carcasses. By mere talk,
        people do not earn passage to Heaven. Salvation comes only from
        the practice of Truth. By adding spices to forbidden foods, they
        are not made acceptable. O Nanak, from false talk, only falsehood
        is obtained.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  There are five prayers and
        five times of day for prayer; the five have five names. Let the
        first be truthfulness, the second honest living, and the third
        charity in the Name of God. Let the fourth be good will to all,
        and the fifth the praise of the Lord. Repeat the prayer of good
        deeds, and then, you may call yourself a Muslim. O Nanak, the
        false obtain falsehood, and only falsehood.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:
        Some trade in priceless jewels, while others deal in mere glass.
        When the True Guru is pleased, we find the treasure of the jewel,
        deep within the self. Without the Guru, no one has found this
        treasure. The blind and the false have died in their endless wanderings.
        The self-willed manmukhs putrefy and die in duality. They do not
        understand contemplative meditation. Without the One Lord, there
        is no other at all. Unto whom should they complain? Some are destitute,
        and wander around endlessly, while others have storehouses of
        wealth. Without God's Name, there is no other wealth. Everything
        else is just poison and ashes. O Nanak, the Lord Himself acts,
        and causes others to act; by the Hukam of His Command, we are
        embellished and exalted.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  It is
        difficult to be called a Muslim; if one is truly a Muslim, then
        he may be called one. First, let him savor the religion of the
        Prophet as sweet; then, let his pride of his possessions be scraped
        away. Becoming a true Muslim, a disciple of the faith of Mohammed,
        let him put aside the delusion of death and life. As he submits
        to God's Will, and surrenders to the Creator, he is rid of
        selfishness and conceit. And when, O Nanak, he is merciful to
        all beings, only then shall he be called a Muslim.  || 1 ||  
        FOURTH MEHL:  Renounce sexual desire, anger, falsehood and slander;
        forsake Maya and eliminate egotistical pride. Renounce sexual
        desire and promiscuity, and give up emotional attachment. Only
        then shall you obtain the Immaculate Lord amidst the darkness
        of the world. Renounce selfishness, conceit and arrogant pride,
        and your love for your children and spouse. Abandon your thirsty
        hopes and desires, and embrace love for the Lord. O Nanak, the
        True One shall come to dwell in your mind. Through the True Word
        of the Shabad, you shall be absorbed in the Name of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Neither the kings, nor their subjects, nor
        the leaders shall remain. The shops, the cities and the streets
        shall eventually disintegrate, by the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command. Those solid and beautiful mansions - the fools think
        that they belong to them. The treasure-houses, filled with wealth,
        shall be emptied out in an instant. The horses, chariots, camels
        and elephants, with all their decorations; the gardens, lands,
        houses, tents, soft beds and satin pavilions - Oh, where are
        those things, which they believe to be their own? O Nanak, the
        True One is the Giver of all; He is revealed through His All-powerful
        Creative Nature.  || 8 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  If the rivers
        became cows, giving milk, and the spring water became milk and
        ghee; </p>
      <p>
        <center>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> If all the earth became sugar, to continually excite the mind;
        if the mountains became gold and silver, studded with gems and
        jewels - even then, I would worship and adore You, and my longing
        to chant Your Praises would not decrease.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        If all the eighteen loads of vegetation became fruits, and the
        growing grass became sweet rice; if I were able to stop the sun
        and the moon in their orbits and hold them perfectly steady - even
        then, I would worship and adore You, and my longing to chant Your
        Praises would not decrease.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  If my body
        were afflicted with pain, under the evil influence of unlucky
        stars; and if the blood-sucking kings were to hold power over
        me - even if this were my condition, I would still worship
        and adore You, and my longing to chant Your Praises would not
        decrease.  || 3 ||   FIRST MEHL:  If fire and ice were my clothes,
        and the wind was my food; and even if the enticing heavenly beauties
        were my wives, O Nanak - all this shall pass away! Even then,
        I would worship and adore You, and my longing to chant Your Praises
        would not decrease.  || 4 ||   PAUREE:  The foolish demon, who
        does evil deeds, does not know his Lord and Master. Call him a
        mad-man, if he does not understand himself. The strife of this
        world is evil; these struggles are consuming it. Without the Lord's
        Name, life is worthless. Through doubt, the people are being destroyed.
        One who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall
        be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn.
        In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who
        remain absorbed in Truth. One who eliminates selfishness and conceit
        is redeemed in the Court of the Lord.  || 9 ||   FIRST MEHL, 
        SHALOK:  They alone are truly alive, whose minds are filled with
        the Lord. O Nanak, no one else is truly alive; those who merely
        live shall depart in dishonor; everything they eat is impure.
        Intoxicated with power and thrilled with wealth, they delight
        in their pleasures, and dance about shamelessly. O Nanak, they
        are deluded and defrauded. Without the Lord's Name, they
        lose their honor and depart.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  What good
        is food, and what good are clothes, if the True Lord does not
        abide within the mind? What good are fruits, what good is ghee,
        what good is sweet molasses, and what good is flour? What good
        are clothes, and what good is a soft bed, to enjoy pleasures and
        sensual delights? What good is an army, and what good are soldiers,
        servants and mansions to live in? O Nanak, without the True Name,
        all this paraphernalia shall disappear.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  What
        good is social class and status? Truthfulness is measured within.
        Pride in one's status is like poison - holding it in your
        hand and eating it, you shall die. The True Lord's Sovereign
        Rule is known throughout the ages. One who respects the Hukam
        of the Lord's Command is honored and respected in the Court
        of the Lord. By the Order of our Lord and Master, we have been
        brought into this world. The Drummer, the Guru, has announced
        the Lord's meditation, through the Word of the Shabad. Some
        have mounted their horses in response, and others are saddling
        up. Some have tied up their bridles, and others have already ridden
        off.  || 10 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  When the crop is ripe,
        then it is cut down; only the stalks are left standing. The corn
        on the cob is put into the thresher, and the kernels are separated
        from the cobs. Placing the kernels between the two mill-stones,
        people sit and grind the corn. Those kernels which stick to the
        central axle are spared - Nanak has seen this wonderful vision!
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Look, and see how the sugar-cane is cut
        down. </p>

      <p> After cutting away its branches, its feet are bound together into
        bundles, and then, it is placed between the wooden rollers and
        crushed. What punishment is inflicted upon it! Its juice is extracted
        and placed in the cauldron; as it is heated, it groans and cries
        out. And then, the crushed cane is collected and burnt in the
        fire below. Nanak: come, people, and see how the sweet sugar-cane
        is treated!  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Some do not think of death; they
        entertain great hopes. They die, and are re-born, and die, over
        and over again. They are of no use at all! In their conscious
        minds, they call themselves good. The King of the Angels of Death
        hunts down those self-willed manmukhs, over and over again. The
        manmukhs are false to their own selves; they feel no gratitude
        for what they have been given. Those who merely perform rituals
        of worship are not pleasing to their Lord and Master. Those who
        attain the True Lord and chant His Name are pleasing to the Lord.
        They worship the Lord and bow at His Throne. They fulfill their
        pre-ordained destiny.  || 11 ||   FIRST MEHL,  SHALOK:  What can
        deep water do to a fish? What can the vast sky do to a bird? What
        can cold do to a stone? What is married life to a eunuch? You
        may apply sandalwood oil to a dog, but he will still be a dog.
        You may try to teach a deaf person by reading the Simritees to
        him, but how will he learn? You may place a light before a blind
        man and burn fifty lamps, but how will he see? You may place gold
        before a herd of cattle, but they will pick out the grass to eat.
        You may add flux to iron and melt it, but it will not become soft
        like cotton. O Nanak, this is the nature of a fool - everything
        he speaks is useless and wasted.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  When
        pieces of bronze or gold or iron break, the metal-smith welds
        them together again in the fire, and the bond is established.
        If a husband leaves his wife, their children may bring them back
        together in the world, and the bond is established. When the king
        makes a demand, and it is met, the bond is established. When the
        hungry man eats, he is satisfied, and the bond is established.
        In the famine, the rain fills the streams to overflowing, and
        the bond is established. There is a bond between love and words
        of sweetness. When one speaks the Truth, a bond is established
        with the Holy Scriptures. Through goodness and truth, the dead
        establish a bond with the living. Such are the bonds which prevail
        in the world. The fool establishes his bonds only when he is slapped
        in the face. Nanak says this after deep reflection: through the
        Lord's Praise, we establish a bond with His Court.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  He Himself created and adorned the Universe, and
        He Himself contemplates it. Some are counterfeit, and some are
        genuine. He Himself is the Appraiser. The genuine are placed in
        His Treasury, while the counterfeit are thrown away. The counterfeit
        are thrown out of the True Court - unto whom should they complain?
        They should worship and follow the True Guru - this is the
        lifestyle of excellence. The True Guru converts the counterfeit
        into genuine; through the Word of the Shabad, He embellishes and
        exalts us. Those who have enshrined love and affection for the
        Guru, are honored in the True Court. Who can estimate the value
        of those who have been forgiven by the Creator Lord Himself? 
        || 12 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  All the spiritual teachers, their
        disciples and the rulers of the world shall be buried under the
        ground. The emperors shall also pass away; God alone is Eternal.
        You alone, Lord, You alone.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Neither the
        angels, nor the demons, nor human beings, nor the Siddhas, nor
        the seekers shall remain on the earth. </p>

      <p> Who else is there? You alone, Lord, You alone.  || 2 ||   FIRST
        MEHL:  Neither the just, nor the generous, nor any humans at all,
        nor the seven realms beneath the earth, shall remain. The One
        Lord alone exists. Who else is there? You alone, Lord, You alone.
        || 3 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the
        planets, nor the seven continents, nor the oceans, nor food, nor
        the wind - nothing is permanent. You alone, Lord, You alone.
        || 4 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Our sustenance is not in the hands of
        any person. The hopes of all rest in the One Lord. The One Lord
        alone exists - who else is there? You alone, Lord, You alone.
        || 5 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The birds have no money in their pockets.
        They place their hopes on trees and water. He alone is the Giver.
        You alone, Lord, You alone.  || 6 ||   FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, that
        destiny which is pre-ordained and written on one's forehead - no
        one can erase it. The Lord infuses strength, and He takes it away
        again. You alone, O Lord, You alone.  || 7 ||   PAUREE:  True
        is the Hukam of Your Command. To the Gurmukh, it is known. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, selfishness and conceit are eradicated,
        and the Truth is realized. True is Your Court. It is proclaimed
        and revealed through the Word of the Shabad. Meditating deeply
        on the True Word of the Shabad, I have merged into the Truth.
        The self-willed manmukhs are always false; they are deluded by
        doubt. They dwell in manure, and they do not know the taste of
        the Name. Without the Name, they suffer the agonies of coming
        and going. O Nanak, the Lord Himself is the Appraiser, who distinguishes
        the counterfeit from the genuine.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        Tigers, hawks, falcons and eagles - the Lord could make them
        eat grass. And those animals which eat grass - He could make
        them eat meat. He could make them follow this way of life. He
        could raise dry land from the rivers, and turn the deserts into
        bottomless oceans. He could appoint a worm as king, and reduce
        an army to ashes. All beings and creatures live by breathing,
        but He could keep us alive, even without the breath. O Nanak,
        as it pleases the True Lord, He gives us sustenance.  || 1 ||
        FIRST MEHL:  Some eat meat, while others eat grass. Some have
        all the thirty-six varieties of delicacies, while others live
        in the dirt and eat mud. Some control the breath, and regulate
        their breathing. Some live by the Support of the Naam, the Name
        of the Formless Lord. The Great Giver lives; no one dies. O Nanak,
        those who do not enshrine the Lord within their minds are deluded.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  By the karma of good actions, some come to
        serve the Perfect Guru. Through the Guru's Teachings, some
        eliminate selfishness and conceit, and meditate on the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord. Undertaking any other task, they waste their
        lives in vain. Without the Name, all that they wear and eat is
        poison. Praising the True Word of the Shabad, they merge with
        the True Lord. Without serving the True Guru, they do not obtain
        the home of peace; they are consigned to reincarnation, over and
        over again. Investing counterfeit capital, they earn only falsehood
        in the world. O Nanak, singing the Praises of the Pure, True Lord,
        they depart with honor.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  When
        it pleases You, we play music and sing; when it pleases You, we
        bathe in water. </p>

      </p>
      <p> When it pleases You, we smear our bodies with ashes, and blow
        the horn and the conch shell. When it pleases You, we read the
        Islamic Scriptures, and are acclaimed as Mullahs and Shaykhs.
        When it pleases You, we become kings, and enjoy all sorts of tastes
        and pleasures. When it pleases You, we wield the sword, and cut
        off the heads of our enemies. When it pleases You, we go out to
        foreign lands; hearing news of home, we come back again. When
        it pleases You, we are attuned to the Name, and when it pleases
        You, we become pleasing to You. Nanak utters this one prayer;
        everything else is just the practice of falsehood.  || 1 ||  
        FIRST MEHL:  You are so Great - all Greatness flows from You.
        You are So Good - Goodness radiates from You. You are True - all
        that flows from You is True. Nothing at all is false. Talking,
        seeing, speaking, walking, living and dying - all these are
        transitory. By the Hukam of His Command, He creates, and in His
        Command, He keeps us. O Nanak, He Himself is True.  || 2 ||  
        PAUREE:  Serve the True Guru fearlessly, and your doubt shall
        be dispelled. Do that work which the True Guru asks you to do.
        When the True Guru becomes merciful, we meditate on the Naam.
        The profit of devotional worship is excellent. It is obtained
        by the Gurmukh. The self-willed manmukhs are trapped in the darkness
        of falsehood; they practice nothing but falsehood. Go to the Gate
        of Truth, and speak the Truth. The True Lord calls the true ones
        to the Mansion of His Presence. O Nanak, the true ones are forever
        true; they are absorbed in the True Lord.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,
        FIRST MEHL:  The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the knife, and the
        kings are butchers; righteousness has sprouted wings and flown
        away. In this dark night of falsehood, the moon of Truth is not
        visible anywhere. I have searched in vain, and I am so confused;
        in this darkness, I cannot find the path. In egotism, they cry
        out in pain. Says Nanak, how will they be saved?  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praise has appeared as a Light in the world. How rare are those
        few Gurmukhs who swim across to the other side! The Lord bestows
        His Glance of Grace; O Nanak, the Gurmukh receives the jewel.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Between the Lord's devotees and the people
        of the world, there can never be any true alliance. The Creator
        Himself is infallible. He cannot be fooled; no one can fool Him.
        He blends His devotees with Himself; they practice Truth, and
        only Truth. The Lord Himself leads the people of the world astray;
        they tell lies, and by telling lies, they eat poison. They do
        not recognize the ultimate reality, that we all must go; they
        continue to cultivate the poisons of sexual desire and anger.
        The devotees serve the Lord; night and day, they meditate on the
        Naam. Becoming the slaves of the Lord's slaves, they eradicate
        selfishness and conceit from within. In the Court of their Lord
        and Master, their faces are radiant; they are embellished and
        exalted with the True Word of the Shabad.  || 16 ||   SHALOK,
        FIRST MEHL:  Those who praise the Lord in the early hours of
        the morning and meditate on Him single-mindedly, are the perfect
        kings; at the right time, they die fighting. In the second watch,
        the focus of the mind is scattered in all sorts of ways. So many
        fall into the bottomless pit; they are dragged under, and they
        cannot get out again. </p>

      </p>
      <p> In the third watch, both hunger and thirst bark for attention,
        and food is put into the mouth. That which is eaten becomes dust,
        but they are still attached to eating. In the fourth watch, they
        become drowsy. They close their eyes and begin to dream. Rising
        up again, they engage in conflicts; they set the stage as if they
        will live for 100 years. If at all times, at each and every moment,
        they live in the fear of God - O Nanak, the Lord dwells within
        their minds, and their cleansing bath is true.  || 1 ||   SECOND
        MEHL:  They are the perfect kings, who have found the Perfect
        Lord. Twenty-four hours a day, they remain unconcerned, imbued
        with the Love of the One Lord. Only a few obtain the Darshan,
        the Blessed Vision of the Unimaginably Beauteous Lord. Through
        the perfect karma of good deeds, one meets the Perfect Guru, whose
        speech is perfect. O Nanak, when the Guru makes one perfect, one's
        weight does not decrease.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  When You are with
        me, what more could I want? I speak only the Truth. Plundered
        by the thieves of worldly affairs, she does not obtain the Mansion
        of His Presence. Being so stone-hearted, she has lost her chance
        to serve the Lord. That heart, in which the True Lord is not found,
        should be torn down and re-built. How can she be weighed accurately,
        upon the scale of perfection? No one will say that her weight
        has been shorted, if she rids herself of egotism. The genuine
        are assayed, and accepted in the Court of the All-knowing Lord.
        The genuine merchandise is found only in one shop - it is obtained
        from the Perfect Guru.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  Twenty-four
        hours a day, destroy the eight things, and in the ninth place,
        conquer the body. Within the body are the nine treasures of the
        Name of the Lord - seek the depths of these virtues. Those
        blessed with the karma of good actions praise the Lord. O Nanak,
        they make the Guru their spiritual teacher. In the fourth watch
        of the early morning hours, a longing arises in their higher consciousness.
        They are attuned to the river of life; the True Name is in their
        minds and on their lips. The Ambrosial Nectar is distributed,
        and those with good karma receive this gift. Their bodies become
        golden, and take on the color of spirituality. If the Jeweller
        casts His Glance of Grace, they are not placed in the fire again.
        Throughout the other seven watches of the day, it is good to speak
        the Truth, and sit with the spiritually wise. There, vice and
        virtue are distinguished, and the capital of falsehood is decreased.
        There, the counterfeit are cast aside, and the genuine are cheered.
        Speech is vain and useless. O Nanak, pain and pleasure are in
        the power of our Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Air
        is the Guru, Water is the Father, and Earth is the Great Mother
        of all. Day and night are the two nurses, in whose lap all the
        world is at play. Good deeds and bad deeds - the record is
        read out in the Presence of the Lord of Dharma. According to their
        own actions, some are drawn closer, and some are driven farther
        away. Those who have meditated on the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        and departed after having worked by the sweat of their brow - O
        Nanak, their faces are radiant in the Court of the Lord, and many
        others are saved along with them!  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The True
        Food is the Love of the Lord; the True Guru has spoken. With this
        True Food, I am satisfied, and with the Truth, I am delighted.
        True are the cities and the villages, where one abides in the
        True Home of the self. When the True Guru is pleased, one receives
        the Lord's Name, and blossoms forth in His Love. No one enters
        the Court of the True Lord through falsehood. By uttering falsehood
        and only falsehood, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is
        lost. </p>

      <p> No one blocks the way of those who are blessed with the Banner
        of the True Word of the Shabad. Hearing, understanding and speaking
        Truth, one is called to the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
        || 18 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  If I dressed myself in fire,
        and built my house of snow, and made iron my food; and if I were
        to drink in all pain like water, and drive the entire earth before
        me; and if I were to place the earth upon a scale and balance
        it with a single copper coin; and if I were to become so great
        that I could not be contained, and if I were to control and lead
        all; and if I were to possess so much power within my mind that
        I could cause others to do my bidding - so what? As Great as
        our Lord and Master is, so great are His gifts. He bestows them
        according to His Will. O Nanak, those upon whom the Lord casts
        His Glance of Grace, obtain the glorious greatness of the True
        Name.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  The mouth is not satisfied by speaking,
        and the ears are not satisfied by hearing. The eyes are not satisfied
        by seeing - each organ seeks out one sensory quality. The hunger
        of the hungry is not appeased; by mere words, hunger is not relieved.
        O Nanak, hunger is relieved only when one utters the Glorious
        Praises of the Praiseworthy Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Without
        the True One, all are false, and all practice falsehood. Without
        the True One, the false ones are bound and gagged and driven off.
        Without the True One, the body is just ashes, and it mingles again
        with ashes. Without the True Ome, all food and clothes are unsatisfying.
        Without the True One, the false ones do not attain the Lord's
        Court. Attached to false attachments, the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence is lost. The whole world is deceived by deception, coming
        and going in reincarnation. Within the body is the fire of desire;
        through the Word of the Shabad, it is quenched.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,
        FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, the Guru is the tree of contentment, with
        flowers of faith, and fruits of spiritual wisdom. Watered with
        the Lord's Love, it remains forever green; through the karma
        of good deeds and meditation, it ripens. Honor is obtained by
        eating this tasty dish; of all gifts, this is the greatest gift.
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The Guru is the tree of gold, with leaves
        of coral, and blossoms of jewels and rubies. The Words from His
        Mouth are fruits of jewels. Within His Heart, He beholds the Lord.
        O Nanak, He is obtained by those, upon whose faces and foreheads
        such pre-recorded destiny is written. The sixty-eight sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage are contained in the constant worship of the feet
        of the Exalted Guru. Cruelty, material attachment, greed and anger
        are the four rivers of fire. Falling into them, one is burned,
        O Nanak! One is saved only by holding tight to good deeds.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  While you are alive, conquer death, and you shall
        have no regrets in the end. This world is false, but only a few
        understand this. People do not enshrine love for the Truth; they
        chase after worldly affairs instead. The terrible time of death
        and annihilation hovers over the heads of the world. By the Hukam
        of the Lord's Command, the Messenger of Death smashes his
        club over their heads. The Lord Himself gives His Love, and enshrines
        it within their minds. Not a moment or an instant's delay
        is permitted, when one's measure of life is full. By Guru's
        Grace, one comes to know the True One, and is absorbed into Him.
        || 20 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Bitter melon, swallow-wort,
        thorn-apple and nim fruit - these bitter poisons lodge in the
        minds and mouths of those who do not remember You. O Nanak, how
        shall I tell them this? Without the karma of good deeds, they
        are only destroying themselves.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The intellect
        is a bird; on account of its actions, it is sometimes high, and
        sometimes low. </p>

      <p> Sometimes it is perched on the sandalwood tree, and sometimes
        it is on the branch of the poisonous swallow-wort. Sometimes,
        it soars through the heavens. O Nanak, our Lord and Master leads
        us on, according to the Hukam of His Command; such is His Way.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Some speak and expound, and while speaking
        and lecturing, they pass away. The Vedas speak and expound on
        the Lord, but they do not know His limits. Not by studying, but
        through understanding, is the Lord's Mystery revealed. There
        are six pathways in the Shaastras, but how rare are those who
        merge in the True Lord through them. The True Lord is Unknowable;
        through the Word of His Shabad, we are embellished. One who believes
        in the Name of the Infinite Lord, attains the Court of the Lord.
        I humbly bow to the Creator Lord; I am a minstrel singing His
        Praises. Nanak enshrines the Lord within his mind. He is the One,
        throughout the ages.  || 21 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  Those
        who charm scorpions and handle snakes only brand themselves with
        their own hands. By the pre-ordained Order of our Lord and Master,
        they are beaten badly, and struck down. If the self-willed manmukhs
        fight with the Gurmukh, they are condemned by the Lord, the True
        Judge. He Himself is the Lord and Master of both worlds. He beholds
        all and makes the exact determination. O Nanak, know this well:
        everything is in accordance with His Will.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:
        O Nanak, if someone judges himself, only then is he known as
        a real judge. If someone understands both the disease and the
        medicine, only then is he a wise physician. Do not involve yourself
        in idle business on the way; remember that you are only a guest
        here. Speak with those who know the Primal Lord, and renounce
        your evil ways. That virtuous person who does not walk in the
        way of greed, and who abides in Truth, is accepted and famous.
        If an arrow is shot at the sky, how can it reach there? The sky
        above is unreachable - know this well, O archer!  || 2 || 
        PAUREE:  The soul-bride loves her Husband Lord; she is embellished
        with His Love. She worships Him day and night; she cannot be restrained
        from doing so. In the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, she
        has made her home; she is adorned with the Word of His Shabad.
        She is humble, and she offers her true and sincere prayer. She
        is beautiful in the Company of her Lord and Master; she walks
        in the Way of His Will. With her dear friends, she offers her
        heart-felt prayers to her Beloved. Cursed is that home, and shameful
        is that life, which is without the Name of the Lord. But she who
        is adorned with the Word of His Shabad, drinks in the Amrit of
        His Nectar.  || 22 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  The desert is not
        satisfied by rain, and the fire is not quenched by desire. The
        king is not satisfied with his kingdom, and the oceans are full,
        but still they thirst for more. O Nanak, how many times must I
        seek and ask for the True Name?  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Life
        is useless, as long as one does not know the Lord God. Only a
        few cross over the world-ocean, by Guru's Grace. The Lord
        is the All-powerful Cause of causes, says Nanak after deep deliberation.
        The creation is subject to the Creator, who sustains it by His
        Almighty Power.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  In the Court of the Lord and
        Master, His minstrels dwell. Singing the Praises of their True
        Lord and Master, the lotuses of their hearts have blossomed forth.
        Obtaining their Perfect Lord and Master, their minds are transfixed
        with ecstasy. Their enemies have been driven out and subdued,
        and their friends are very pleased. Those who serve the Truthful
        True Guru are shown the True Path. </p>

      <p> Reflecting on the True Word of the Shabad, death is overcome.
        Speaking the Unspoken Speech of the Lord, one is adorned with
        the Word of His Shabad. Nanak holds tight to the Treasure of Virtue,
        and meets with the Dear, Beloved Lord.  || 23 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST
        MEHL:  Born because of the karma of their past mistakes, they
        make more mistakes, and fall into mistakes. By washing, their
        pollution is not removed, even though they may wash hundreds of
        times. O Nanak, if God forgives, they are forgiven; otherwise,
        they are kicked and beaten.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, it
        is absurd to ask to be spared from pain by begging for comfort.
        Pleasure and pain are the two garments given, to be worn in the
        Court of the Lord. Where you are bound to lose by speaking, there,
        you ought to remain silent.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  After looking
        around in the four directions, I looked within my own self. There,
        I saw the True, Invisible Lord Creator. I was wandering in the
        wilderness, but now the Guru has shown me the Way. Hail to the
        True, True Guru, through whom we merge in the Truth. I have found
        the jewel within the home of my own self; the lamp within has
        been lit. Those who praise the True Word of the Shabad, abide
        in the peace of Truth. But those who do not have the Fear of God,
        are overtaken by fear. They are destroyed by their own pride.
        Having forgotten the Name, the world is roaming around like a
        wild demon.  || 24 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  In fear we are born,
        and in fear we die. Fear is always present in the mind. O Nanak,
        if one dies in the fear of God, his coming into the world is blessed
        and approved.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Without the fear of God,
        you may live very, very long, and savor the most enjoyable pleasures.
        O Nanak, if you die without the fear of God, you will arise and
        depart with a blackened face.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  When the True
        Guru is merciful, then your desires will be fulfilled. When the
        True Guru is merciful, you will never grieve. When the True Guru
        is merciful, you will know no pain. When the True Guru is merciful,
        you will enjoy the Lord's Love. When the True Guru is merciful,
        then why should you fear death? When the True Guru is merciful,
        the body is always at peace. When the True Guru is merciful, the
        nine treasures are obtained. When the True Guru is merciful, you
        shall be absorbed in the True Lord.  || 25 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST
        MEHL:  They pluck the hair out of their heads, and drink in filthy
        water; they beg endlessly and eat the garbage which others have
        thrown away. They spread manure, they suck in rotting smells,
        and they are afraid of clean water. Their hands are smeared with
        ashes, and the hair on their heads is plucked out - they are
        like sheep! They have renounced the lifestyle of their mothers
        and fathers, and their families and relatives cry out in distress.
        No one offers the rice dishes at their last rites, and no one
        lights the lamps for them. After their death, where will they
        be sent? The sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage give them
        no place of protection, and no Brahmin will eat their food. They
        remain polluted forever, day and night; they do not apply the
        ceremonial tilak mark to their foreheads. They sit together in
        silence, as if in mourning; they do not go to the Lord's
        Court. With their begging bowls hanging from their waists, and
        their fly-brushes in their hands, they walk along in single file.
        They are not Yogis, and they are not Jangams, followers of Shiva. </p>

      <p> They are not Qazis or Mullahs. Ruined by the Merciful Lord, they
        wander around in disgrace, and their entire troop is contaminated.
        The Lord alone kills and restores to life; no one else can protect
        anyone from Him. They go without giving alms or any cleansing
        baths; their shaven heads become covered with dust. The jewel
        emerged from the water, when the mountain of gold was used to
        churn it. The gods established the sixty-eight sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage, where the festivals are celebrated and hymns are
        chanted. After bathing, the Muslims recite their prayers, and
        after bathing, the Hindus perform their worship services. The
        wise always take cleansing baths. At the time of death, and at
        the time of birth, they are purified, when water is poured on
        their heads. O Nanak, the shaven-headed ones are devils. They
        are not pleased to hear these words. When it rains, there is happiness.
        Water is the key to all life. When it rains, the corn grows, and
        the sugar cane, and the cotton, which provides clothing for all.
        When it rains, the cows always have grass to graze upon, and housewives
        can churn the milk into butter. With that ghee, sacred feasts
        and worship services are performed; all these efforts are blessed.
        The Guru is the ocean, and all His Teachings are the river. Bathing
        within it, glorious greatness is obtained. O Nanak, if the shaven-headed
        ones do not bathe, then seven handfuls of ashes are upon their
        heads.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  What can the cold do to the fire?
        How can the night affect the sun? What can the darkness do to
        the moon? What can social status do to air and water? What are
        personal possessions to the earth, from which all things are produced?
        O Nanak, he alone is known as honorable, whose honor the Lord
        preserves.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  It is of You, O my True and Wondrous
        Lord, that I sing forever. Yours is the True Court. All others
        are subject to coming and going. Those who ask for the gift of
        the True Name are like You. Your Command is True; we are adorned
        with the Word of Your Shabad. Through faith and trust, we receive
        spiritual wisdom and meditation from You. By Your Grace, the banner
        of honor is obtained. It cannot be taken away or lost. You are
        the True Giver; You give continually. Your Gifts continue to increase.
        Nanak begs for that gift which is pleasing to You.  || 26 || 
        SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  Those who have accepted the Guru's
        Teachings, and who have found the path, remain absorbed in the
        Praises of the True Lord. What teachings can be imparted to those
        who have the Divine Guru Nanak as their Guru?  || 1 ||   FIRST
        MEHL:  We understand the Lord only when He Himself inspires us
        to understand Him. He alone knows everything, unto whom the Lord
        Himself gives knowledge. One may talk and preach and give sermons
        but still yearn after Maya. The Lord, by the Hukam of His Command,
        has created the entire creation. He Himself knows the inner nature
        of all. O Nanak, He Himself uttered the Word. Doubt departs from
        one who receives this gift.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  I was a minstrel,
        out of work, when the Lord took me into His service. To sing His
        Praises day and night, He gave me His Order, right from the start.
        My Lord and Master has summoned me, His minstrel, to the True
        Mansion of His Presence. He has dressed me in the robes of His
        True Praise and Glory. The Ambrosial Nectar of the True Name has
        become my food. Those who follow the Guru's Teachings, who
        eat this food and are satisfied, find peace. His minstrel spreads
        His Glory, singing and vibrating the Word of His Shabad. O Nanak,
        praising the True Lord, I have obtained His Perfection.  || 27
