      <p> Says Nanak, in the first watch of the night, by the Hukam of the
        Lord's Command, you enter into the womb.  || 1 ||   In the
        second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you have forgotten
        to meditate. From hand to hand, you are passed around, O my merchant
        friend, like Krishna in the house of Yashoda. From hand to hand,
        you are passed around, and your mother says, &quot;This is my
        son.&quot; O, my thoughtless and foolish mind, think: In the end,
        nothing shall be yours. You do not know the One who created the
        creation. Gather spiritual wisdom within your mind. Says Nanak,
        in the second watch of the night, you have forgotten to meditate.
        || 2 ||   In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend,
        your consciousness is focused on wealth and youth. You have not
        remembered the Name of the Lord, O my merchant friend, although
        it would release you from bondage. You do not remember the Name
        of the Lord, and you become confused by Maya. Revelling in your
        riches and intoxicated with youth, you waste your life uselessly.
        You have not traded in righteousness and Dharma; you have not
        made good deeds your friends. Says Nanak, in the third watch of
        the night, your mind is attached to wealth and youth.  || 3 ||
        In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the
        Grim Reaper comes to the field. When the Messenger of Death seizes
        and dispatches you, O my merchant friend, no one knows the mystery
        of where you have gone. So think of the Lord! No one knows this
        secret, of when the Messenger of Death will seize you and take
        you away. All your weeping and wailing then is false. In an instant,
        you become a stranger. You obtain exactly what you have longed
        for. Says Nanak, in the fourth watch of the night, O mortal, the
        Grim Reaper has harvested your field.  || 4 || 1 ||   SIREE RAAG,
        FIRST MEHL:  In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend,
        your innocent mind has a child-like understanding. You drink milk,
        and you are fondled so gently, O my merchant friend. The mother
        and father love their child so much, but in Maya, all are caught
        in emotional attachment. By the good fortune of good deeds done
        in the past, you have come, and now you perform actions to determine
        your future. Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not obtained,
        and you are drowned in the love of duality. Says Nanak, in the
        first watch of the night, O mortal, you shall be saved by remembering
        the Lord.  || 1 ||   In the second watch of the night, O my merchant
        friend, you are intoxicated with the wine of youth and beauty.
        Day and night, you are engrossed in sexual desire, O my merchant
        friend, and your consciousness is blind to the Naam. The Lord's
        Name is not within your heart, but all sorts of other tastes seem
        sweet to you. You have no wisdom at all, no meditation, no virtue
        or self-discipline; in falsehood, you are caught in the cycle
        of birth and death. Pilgrimages, fasts, purification and self-discipline
        are of no use, nor are rituals, religious ceremonies or empty
        worship. O Nanak, emancipation comes only by loving devotional
        worship; through duality, people are engrossed in duality.  ||
        2 ||   In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend,
        the swans, the white hairs, come and land upon the pool of the
        head. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Youth wears itself out, and old age triumphs, O my merchant friend;
        as time passes, your days diminish. At the last moment, you repent - you
        are so blind! - when the Messenger of Death seizes you and
        carries you away. You kept all your things for yourself, but in
        an instant, they are all lost. Your intellect left you, your wisdom
        departed, and now you repent for the evil deeds you committed.
        Says Nanak, O mortal, in the third watch of the night, let your
        consciousness be lovingly focused on God.  || 3 ||   In the fourth
        watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your body grows old
        and weak. Your eyes go blind, and cannot see, O my merchant friend,
        and your ears do not hear any words. Your eyes go blind, and your
        tongue is unable to taste; you live only with the help of others.
        With no virtue within, how can you find peace? The self-willed
        manmukh comes and goes in reincarnation. When the crop of life
        has matured, it bends, breaks and perishes; why take pride in
        that which comes and goes? Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth
        watch of the night, the Gurmukh recognizes the Word of the Shabad.
        || 4 ||   Your breath comes to its end, O my merchant friend,
        and your shoulders are weighed down by the tyrant of old age.
        Not one iota of virtue came into you, O my merchant friend; bound
        and gagged by evil, you are driven along. One who departs with
        virtue and self-discipline is not struck down, and is not consigned
        to the cycle of birth and death. The Messenger of Death and his
        trap cannot touch him; through loving devotional worship, he crosses
        over the ocean of fear. He departs with honor, and merges in intuitive
        peace and poise; all his pains depart. Says Nanak, when the mortal
        becomes Gurmukh, he is saved and honored by the True Lord.  ||
        5 || 2 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FOURTH MEHL:  In the first watch of the
        night, O my merchant friend, the Lord places you in the womb.
        You meditate on the Lord, and chant the Lord's Name, O my
        merchant friend. You contemplate the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and meditating on it
        within the fire of the womb, your life is sustained by dwelling
        on the Naam. You are born and you come out, and your mother and
        father are delighted to see your face. Remember the One, O mortal,
        to whom the child belongs. As Gurmukh, reflect upon Him within
        your heart. Says Nanak, O mortal, in the first watch of the night,
        dwell upon the Lord, who shall shower you with His Grace.  ||
        1 ||   In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend,
        the mind is attached to the love of duality. Mother and father
        hug you close in their embrace, claiming, &quot;He is mine, he
        is mine&quot;; so is the child brought up, O my merchant friend.
        Your mother and father constantly hug you close in their embrace;
        in their minds, they believe that you will provide for them and
        support them. The fool does not know the One who gives; instead,
        he clings to the gift. Rare is the Gurmukh who reflects upon,
        meditates upon, and within his mind, is lovingly attached to the
        Lord. Says Nanak, in the second watch of the night, O mortal,
        death never devours you.  || 2 ||   In the third watch of the
        night, O my merchant friend, your mind is entangled in worldly
        and household affairs. You think of wealth, and gather wealth,
        O my merchant friend, but you do not contemplate the Lord or the
        Lord's Name. </p>

      </p>
      <p> You never dwell upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, who will
        be your only Helper and Support in the end. This wealth, property
        and Maya are false. In the end, you must leave these, and depart
        in sorrow. Those whom the Lord, in His Mercy, unites with the
        Guru, reflect upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Says Nanak,
        in the third watch of the night, O mortal, they go, and are united
        with the Lord.  || 3 ||   In the fourth watch of the night, O
        my merchant friend, the Lord announces the time of departure.
        Serve the Perfect True Guru, O my merchant friend; your entire
        life-night is passing away. Serve the Lord each and every instant - do
        not delay! You shall become eternal throughout the ages. Enjoy
        ecstasy forever with the Lord, and do away with the pains of birth
        and death. Know that there is no difference between the Guru,
        the True Guru, and your Lord and Master. Meeting with Him, take
        pleasure in the Lord's devotional service. Says Nanak, O
        mortal, in the fourth watch of the night, the life-night of the
        devotee is fruitful.  || 4 || 1 || 3 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the Lord
        placed your soul in the womb. In the tenth month, you were made
        into a human being, O my merchant friend, and you were given your
        allotted time to perform good deeds. You were given this time
        to perform good deeds, according to your pre-ordained destiny.
        God placed you with your mother, father, brothers, sons and wife.
        God Himself is the Cause of causes, good and bad - no one has
        control over these things. Says Nanak, O mortal, in the first
        watch of the night, the soul is placed in the womb.  || 1 || 
        In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the fullness
        of youth rises in you like waves. You do not distinguish between
        good and evil, O my merchant friend - your mind is intoxicated
        with ego. Mortal beings do not distinguish between good and evil,
        and the road ahead is treacherous. They never serve the Perfect
        True Guru, and the cruel tyrant Death stands over their heads.
        When the Righteous Judge seizes you and interrogates you, O madman,
        what answer will you give him then? Says Nanak, in the second
        watch of the night, O mortal, the fullness of youth tosses you
        about like waves in the storm.  || 2 ||   In the third watch of
        the night, O my merchant friend, the blind and ignorant person
        gathers poison. He is entangled in emotional attachment to his
        wife and sons, O my merchant friend, and deep within him, the
        waves of greed are rising up. The waves of greed are rising up
        within him, and he does not remember God. He does not join the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and he suffers in terrible
        pain through countless incarnations. He has forgotten the Creator,
        his Lord and Master, and he does not meditate on Him, even for
        an instant. Says Nanak, in the third watch of the night, the blind
        and ignorant person gathers poison.  || 3 ||   In the fourth watch
        of the night, O my merchant friend, that day is drawing near.
        As Gurmukh, remember the Naam, O my merchant friend. It shall
        be your Friend in the Court of the Lord. As Gurmukh, remember
        the Naam, O mortal; in the end, it shall be your only companion. </p>

      <p> This emotional attachment to Maya shall not go with you; it is
        false to fall in love with it. The entire night of your life has
        passed away in darkness; but by serving the True Guru, the Divine
        Light shall dawn within. Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth watch
        of the night, that day is drawing near!  || 4 ||   Receiving the
        summons from the Lord of the Universe, O my merchant friend, you
        must arise and depart with the actions you have committed. You
        are not allowed a moment's delay, O my merchant friend; the
        Messenger of Death seizes you with firm hands. Receiving the summons,
        people are seized and dispatched. The self-willed manmukhs are
        miserable forever. But those who serve the Perfect True Guru are
        forever happy in the Court of the Lord. The body is the field
        of karma in this age; whatever you plant, you shall harvest. Says
        Nanak, the devotees look beautiful in the Court of the Lord; the
        self-willed manmukhs wander forever in reincarnation.  || 5 ||

        SIREE RAAG,  FOURTH MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE,  CHHANT:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> How can the ignorant soul-bride obtain the Blessed Vision of the
        Lord's Darshan, while she is in this world of her father's
        home? When the Lord Himself grants His Grace, the Gurmukh learns
        the duties of her Husband's Celestial Home. The Gurmukh learns
        the duties of her Husband's Celestial Home; she meditates
        forever on the Lord, Har, Har. She walks happily among her companions,
        and in the Lord's Court, she swings her arms joyfully. Her
        account is cleared by the Righteous Judge of Dharma, when she
        chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The ignorant soul-bride
        becomes Gurmukh, and gains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan, while she is still in her father's house.  || 1
        ||   My marriage has been performed, O my father. As Gurmukh,
        I have found the Lord. The darkness of ignorance has been dispelled.
        The Guru has revealed the blazing light of spiritual wisdom. This
        spiritual wisdom given by the Guru shines forth, and the darkness
        has been dispelled. I have found the Priceless Jewel of the Lord.
        The sickness of my ego has been dispelled, and my pain is over
        and done. Through the Guru's Teachings, my identity has consumed
        my identical identity. I have obtained my Husband Lord, the Akaal
        Moorat, the Undying Form. He is Imperishable; He shall never die,
        and He shall never ever leave. My marriage has been performed,
        O my father. As Gurmukh, I have found the Lord.  || 2 ||   The
        Lord is the Truest of the True, O my father. Meeting with the
        humble servants of the Lord, the marriage procession looks beautiful.
        She who chants the Lord's Name is happy in this world of
        her father's home, and in the next world of her Husband Lord,
        she shall be very beautiful. In her Husband Lord's Celestial
        Home, she shall be most beautiful, if she has remembered the Naam
        in this world. Fruitful are the lives of those who, as Gurmukh,
        have conquered their minds - they have won the game of life.
        Joining with the humble Saints of the Lord, my actions bring prosperity,
        and I have obtained the Lord of Bliss as my Husband. The Lord
        is the Truest of the True, O my father. Joining with the humble
        servants of the Lord, the marriage party has been embellished.
        || 3 ||   O my father, give me the Name of the Lord God as my
        wedding gift and dowry. </p>

      <p> Give me the Lord as my wedding gown, and the Lord as my glory,
        to accomplish my works. Through devotional worship to the Lord,
        this ceremony is made blissful and beautiful; the Guru, the True
        Guru, has given this gift. Across the continents, and throughout
        the Universe, the Lord's Glory is pervading. This gift is
        not diminished by being diffused among all. Any other dowry, which
        the self-willed manmukhs offer for show, is only false egotism
        and a worthless display. O my father, please give me the Name
        of the Lord God as my wedding gift and dowry.  || 4 ||   The Lord,
        Raam, Raam, is All-pervading, O my father. Meeting her Husband
        Lord, the soul-bride blossoms forth like the flourishing vine.
        In age after age, through all the ages, forever and ever, those
        who belong to the Guru's Family shall prosper and increase.
        Age after age, the Family of the True Guru shall increase. As
        Gurmukh, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The
        Almighty Lord never dies or goes away. Whatever He gives, keeps
        on increasing. O Nanak, the One Lord is the Saint of Saints. Chanting
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the soul-bride is bountiful and
        beautiful. The Lord, Raam, Raam, is All-pervading, O my father.
        Meeting her Husband Lord, the soul-bride blossoms forth like the
        flourishing vine.  || 5 || 1 || </p>

      </center>
      <p> O dear beloved mind, my friend, reflect upon the Name of the Lord
        of the Universe. O dear beloved mind, my friend, the Lord shall
        always be with you. The Name of the Lord shall be with you as
        your Helper and Support. Meditate on Him - no one who does
        so shall ever return empty-handed. You shall obtain the fruits
        of your mind's desires, by focusing your consciousness on
        the Lord's Lotus Feet. He is totally pervading the water
        and the land; He is the Lord of the World-forest. Behold Him in
        exaltation in each and every heart. Nanak gives this advice: O
        beloved mind, in the Company of the Holy, burn away your doubts.
        || 1 ||   O dear beloved mind, my friend, without the Lord, all
        outward show is false. O dear beloved mind, my friend, the world
        is an ocean of poison. Let the Lord's Lotus Feet be your
        Boat, so that pain and skepticism shall not touch you. Meeting
        with the Perfect Guru, by great good fortune, meditate on God
        twenty-four hours a day. From the very beginning, and throughout
        the ages, He is the Lord and Master of His servants. His Name
        is the Support of His devotees. Nanak gives this advice: O beloved
        mind, without the Lord, all outward show is false.  || 2 ||  
        O dear beloved mind, my friend, load the profitable cargo of the
        Lord's Name. O dear beloved mind, my friend, enter through
        the eternal Door of the Lord. One who serves at the Door of the
        Imperceptible and Unfathomable Lord, obtains this eternal position.
        There is no birth or death there, no coming or going; anguish
        and anxiety are ended. The accounts of Chitr and Gupt, the recording
        scribes of the conscious and the subconscious are torn up, and
        the Messenger of Death cannot do anything. Nanak gives this advice:
        O beloved mind, load the profitable cargo of the Lord's Name.
        || 3 ||   O dear beloved mind, my friend, abide in the Society
        of the Saints. O dear beloved mind, my friend, chanting the Lord's
        Name, the Divine Light shines within. </p>

        Lord, the Greatest Lover. Separated from Him for so long, I am
        united with Him again. Inside and out, He is pervading everywhere.
        Faith in Him has welled up within my mind. Nanak gives this advice:
        O beloved mind, let the Society of the Saints be your dwelling.
        || 4 ||   O dear beloved mind, my friend, let your mind remain
        absorbed in loving devotion to the Lord. O dear beloved mind,
        my friend, the fish of the mind lives only when it is immersed
        in the Water of the Lord. Drinking in the Lord's Ambrosial
        Bani, the mind is satisfied, and all pleasures come to abide within.
        Attaining the Lord of Excellence, I sing the Songs of Joy. The
        True Guru, becoming merciful, has fulfilled my desires. He has
        attached me to the hem of His robe, and I have obtained the nine
        treasures. My Lord and Master has bestowed His Name, which is
        everything to me. Nanak instructs the Saints to teach, that the
        mind is imbued with loving devotion to the Lord.  || 5 || 1 ||

      <p> DAKHANAA:  My Beloved Husband Lord is deep within my heart. How
        can I see Him? In the Sanctuary of the Saints, O Nanak, the Support
        of the breath of life is found.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  To love the
        Lotus Feet of the Lord - this way of life has come into the
        minds of His Saints. The love of duality, this evil practice,
        this bad habit, is not liked by the Lord's slaves. It is
        not pleasing to the Lord's slaves; without the Blessed Vision
        of the Lord's Darshan, how can they find peace, even for
        a moment? Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the body and
        mind are empty; like fish out of water, they die. Please meet
        with me, O my Beloved - You are the Support of my breath of
        life. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing
        Your Glorious Praises. O Lord and Master of Nanak, please grant
        Your Grace, and permeate my body, mind and being.  || 1 ||   DAKHANAA:
        He is Beautiful in all places; I do not see any other at all.
        Meeting with the True Guru, O Nanak, the doors are opened wide.
        || 1 ||   CHHANT:  Your Word is Incomparable and Infinite. I
        contemplate the Word of Your Bani, the Support of the Saints.
        I remember Him in meditation with every breath and morsel of food,
        with perfect faith. How could I forget Him from my mind? How could
        I forget Him from my mind, even for an instant? He is the Most
        Worthy; He is my very life! My Lord and Master is the Giver of
        the fruits of the mind's desires. He knows all the useless
        vanities and pains of the soul. Meditating on the Patron of lost
        souls, the Companion of all, your life shall not be lost in the
        gamble. Nanak offers this prayer to God: Please shower me with
        Your Mercy, and carry me across the terrifying world-ocean.  ||
        2 ||   DAKHANAA:  People bathe in the dust of the feet of the
        Saints, when the Lord becomes merciful. I have obtained all things,
        O Nanak; the Lord is my Wealth and Property.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:
        My Lord and Master's Home is beautiful. It is the resting
        place of His devotees, who live in hopes of attaining it. </p>

      <p> Their minds and bodies are absorbed in meditation on the Name
        of God; they drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar. They drink
        in the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar, and become eternally stable.
        They know that the water of corruption is insipid and tasteless.
        When my God, the Lord of the Universe became merciful, I came
        to look upon the Saadh Sangat as the treasure. All pleasures and
        supreme ecstasy, O my Beloved, come to those who sew the Jewel
        of the Lord into their minds. They do not forget, even for an
        instant, the Support of the breath of life. They live by constantly
        meditating on Him, O Nanak.  || 3 ||   DAKHANAA:  O Lord, You
        meet and merge with those whom you have made Your Own. You Yourself
        are entranced, O Nanak, hearing Your Own Praises.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:
        Administering the intoxicating drug of love, I have won over
        the Lord of the Universe; I have fascinated His Mind. By the Grace
        of the Saints, I am held in the loving embrace of the Unfathomable
        Lord, and I am entranced. Held in the Lord's loving embrace,
        I look beautiful, and all my pains have been dispelled. By the
        loving worship of His devotees, the Lord has come under their
        power. All pleasures have come to dwell in the mind; the Lord
        of the Universe is pleased and appeased. Birth and death have
        been totally eliminated. O my companions, sing the Songs of Joy.
        My desires have been fulfilled, and I shall never again be trapped
        or shaken by Maya. Taking hold of my hand, O Nanak, my Beloved
        God will not let me be swallowed up by the world-ocean.  || 4
        ||   DAKHANAA:  The Master's Name is Priceless; no one knows
        its value. Those who have good destiny recorded upon their foreheads,
        O Nanak, enjoy the Love of the Lord.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  Those
        who chant are sanctified. All those who listen are blessed, and
        those who write save their ancestors. Those who join the Saadh
        Sangat are imbued with the Lord's Love; they reflect and
        meditate on God. Contemplating God, their lives are reformed and
        redeemed; God has showered His Perfect Mercy upon them. Taking
        them by the hand, the Lord has blessed them with His Praises.
        They no longer have to wander in reincarnation, and they never
        have to die. Through the Kind and Compassionate True Guru, I have
        met the Lord; I have conquered sexual desire, anger and greed.
        Our Indescribable Lord and Master cannot be described. Nanak is
        devoted, forever a sacrifice to Him.  || 5 || 1 || 3 || </p>

        SIREE RAAG,  FOURTH MEHL,  VANAJAARAA ~ THE MERCHANT:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  TRUTH IS THE NAME.  BY GURU'S
          GRACE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Excellent and Sublime. He created
        everyone. The Lord cherishes all beings. He permeates each and
        every heart. Meditate forever on that Lord. Without Him, there
        is no other at all. Those who focus their consciousness on emotional
        attachment to Maya must leave; they depart crying out in despair.
        Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, his
        only Companion in the end.  || 1 ||   I have none other than You,
        O Lord. In the Guru's Sanctuary, the Lord is found, O my
        merchant friend; by great good fortune, He is obtained.  || 1

      <p> Without the humble Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, no one has obtained
        the Lord's Name. Those who do their deeds in ego are like
        the prostitute's son, who has no name. The father's
        status is obtained only if the Guru is pleased and bestows His
        Favor. By great good fortune, the Guru is found; embrace love
        for the Lord, day and night. Servant Nanak has realized God; he
        sings the Lord's Praises through the actions he does.  ||
        2 ||   In my mind there is such a deep yearning for the Lord,
        Har, Har. The Perfect Guru has implanted the Naam within me; I
        have found the Lord through the Lord God's Name.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   As long as there is youth and health, meditate on
        the Naam. Along the way, the Lord shall go along with you, and
        in the end, He shall save you. I am a sacrifice to those, within
        whose minds the Lord has come to dwell. Those who have not remembered
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, shall leave with regret in the
        end. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their
        foreheads, O servant Nanak, meditate on the Naam.  || 3 ||   O
        my mind, embrace love for the Lord, Har, Har. By great good fortune,
        the Guru is found; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        we are carried across to the other side.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        The Lord Himself creates, He Himself gives and takes away. The
        Lord Himself leads us astray in doubt; the Lord Himself imparts
        understanding. The minds of the Gurmukhs are illuminated and enlightened;
        they are so very rare. I am a sacrifice to those who find the
        Lord, through the Guru's Teachings. Servant Nanak's
        heart-lotus has blossomed forth, and the Lord, Har, Har, has come
        to dwell in the mind.  || 4 ||   O mind, chant the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har. Hurry to the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Guru,
        O my soul; all the painful residues of your past mistakes shall
        be taken away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The All-pervading Lord dwells
        within each and every person's heart - how can He be obtained?
        By meeting the Perfect Guru, the True Guru, the Lord comes to
        dwell within the conscious mind. The Naam is my Support and Sustenance.
        From the Lord's Name, I obtain salvation and understanding.
        My faith is in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Lord's
        Name is my status and honor. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord; He is dyed in the deep crimson color of
        the Lord's Love.  || 5 ||   Meditate on the Lord, the True
        Lord God. Through the Guru's Word, you shall come to know
        the Lord God. From the Lord God, everything was created.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, come
        to the Guru and meet Him. They love to serve, O my merchant friend,
        and through the Guru, they are illuminated by the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har. Blessed, blessed is the trade of those traders
        who have loaded the merchandise of the Wealth of the Lord. The
        faces of the Gurmukhs are radiant in the Court of the Lord; they
        come to the Lord and merge with Him. O servant Nanak, they alone
        find the Guru, with whom the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence,
        is pleased.  || 6 ||   Meditate on the Lord, with every breath
        and morsel of food. The Gurmukhs embrace the Love of the Lord
        in their minds; they are continually occupied with the Lord's
        Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 1 || <br>
