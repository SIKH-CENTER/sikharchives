      <p> The Lord is your Help and Support.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Grasping
        hold of the Feet of the Saints, I have abandoned sexual desire,
        anger and greed. The Guru, the Lord of the World, has been kind
        to me, and I have realized my destiny.  || 1 ||   My doubts and
        attachments have been dispelled, and the blinding bonds of Maya
        have been broken. My Lord and Master is pervading and permeating
        everywhere; no one is an enemy. My Lord and Master is totally
        satisfied with me; He has rid me of the pains of death and birth.
        Grasping hold of the Feet of the Saints, Nanak sings the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord.  || 2 || 3 || 132 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har; enshrine the Lord,
        Har, Har, within your mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Hear Him with
        your ears, and practice devotional worship - these are
        good deeds, which make up for past evils. So seek the Sanctuary
        of the Holy, and forget all your other habits.  || 1 ||   Love
        the Lord's Feet, continually and continuously -
        the most sacred and sanctified. Fear is taken away from the servant
        of the Lord, and the dirty residues of past sinful mistakes are
        burnt away. Those who speak are liberated, and those who listen
        are liberated; those who keep the Rehit, the Code of Conduct,
        are not reincarnated again. The Lord's Name is the most
        sublime essence; Nanak contemplates the nature of reality.  ||
        2 || 4 || 133 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  I beg for devotion to
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord; I have forsaken all other activities.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate lovingly on the Lord, and sing
        forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. I long
        for the dust of the feet of the Lord's humble servant,
        O Great Giver, my Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   The Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, is the ultimate ecstasy, bliss, happiness, peace
        and tranquility. The fear is death is dispelled by meditating
        in remembrance on the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. Only
        the Sanctuary of the Feet of the Lord of the Universe can destroy
        all the suffering of the world. The Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, is the boat, O Nanak, to carry us across to the other
        side.  || 2 || 5 || 134 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Gazing upon
        my Guru, I sing the Praises of my Beloved Lord. I escape from
        the five thieves, and I find the One, when I join the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Nothing of the
        visible world shall go along with you; abandon your pride and
        attachment. Love the One Lord, and join the Saadh Sangat, and
        you shall be embellished and exalted.  || 1 ||   I have found
        the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence; all my hopes have been fulfilled.
        Nanak's mind is in ecstasy; the Guru has shattered the
        impregnable fortress.  || 2 || 6 || 135 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        My mind is neutral and detached; I seek only the Blessed Vision
        of His Darshan.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Serving the Holy Saints,
        I meditate on my Beloved within my heart. Gazing upon the Embodiment
        of Ecstasy, I rise to the Mansion of His Presence.  || 1 ||  
        I work for Him; I have forsaken everything else. I seek only His
        Sanctuary. O Nanak, my Lord and Master hugs me close in His Embrace;
        the Guru is pleased and satisfied with me.  || 2 || 7 || 136 ||
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  This is my condition. Only my Merciful
        Lord knows it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have abandoned my mother
        and father, and sold my mind to the Saints. I have lost my social
        status, birth-right and ancestry; I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   I have broken away from other
        people and family; I work only for God. <br>

      <p> The Guru has taught me, O Nanak, to serve only the One Lord. 
        || 2 || 8 || 137 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are my Loving
        Beloved Enticing Lord of the World. You are in worms, elephants,
        stones and all beings and creatures; You nourish and cherish them
        all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are not far away; You are totally
        present with all. You are Beautiful, the Source of Nectar.  ||
        1 ||   You have no caste or social class, no ancestry or family.
        Nanak: God, You are Merciful.  || 2 || 9 || 138 ||   Acting and
        play-acting, the mortal sinks into corruption. Even the moon and
        the sun are enticed and bewitched. The disturbing noise of corruption
        wells up, in the tinkling ankle bells of Maya the beautiful. With
        her beguiling gestures of love, she seduces everyone except the
        Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   Maya clings to the three worlds; those
        who are stuck in wrong actions cannot escape her. Drunk and engrossed
        in blind worldly affairs, they are tossed about on the mighty
        ocean.  || 1 ||   The Saint, the slave of the Lord is saved; the
        noose of the Messenger of Death is snapped. The Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, is the Purifier of sinners; O Nanak, remember Him
        in meditation.  || 2 || 10 || 139 || 3 || 13 || 155 || <br>

          RAAG SAARANG,  NINTH MEHL:
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> <font color="#000000">No one will be your help and support, except
        the Lord. Who has any mother, father, child or spouse? Who is
        anyone's brother or sister?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All the
        wealth, land and property which you consider your own -
        when you leave your body, none of it shall go along with you.
        Why do you cling to them?  || 1 ||   God is Merciful to the meek,
        forever the Destroyer of fear, and yet you do not develop any
        loving relationship with Him. Says Nanak, the whole world is totally
        false; it is like a dream in the night.  || 2 || 1 ||   SAARANG,
        NINTH MEHL:  O mortal, why are you engrossed in corruption? No
        one is allowed to remain in this world; one comes, and another
        departs.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Who has a body? Who has wealth
        and property? With whom should we fall in love? Whatever is seen,
        shall all disappear, like the shade of a passing cloud.  || 1
        ||   Abandon egotism, and grasp the Sanctuary of the Saints; you
        shall be liberated in an instant. O servant Nanak, without meditating
        and vibrating on the Lord God, there is no peace, even in dreams.
        || 2 || 2||   SAARANG,  NINTH MEHL:  O mortal, why have you wasted
        your life? Intoxicated with Maya and its riches, involved in corrupt
        pleasures, you have not sought the Sanctuary of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   This whole world is just a dream; why does seeing
        it fill you with greed? Everything that has been created will
        be destroyed; nothing will remain.  || 1 ||   You see this false
        body as true; in this way, you have placed yourself in bondage.
        O servant Nanak, he is a liberated being, whose consciousness
        lovingly vibrates, and meditates on the Lord.  || 2 || 3 ||  
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  In my mind, I never sang the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord. <br>

      <p> I remained under the influence of corruption, night and day; I
        did whatever I pleased.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I never listened
        to the Guru's Teachings; I was entangled with others'
        spouses. I ran all around slandering others; I was taught, but
        I never learned.  || 1 ||   How can I even describe my actions?
        This is how I wasted my life. Says Nanak, I am totally filled
        with faults. I have come to Your Sanctuary - please save
        me, O Lord!  || 2 || 4 || 3 || 13 || 139 || 4 || 159 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">How can I live, O my mother? Hail to the Lord
        of the Universe. I ask to sing Your Praises; without You, O Lord,
        I cannot even survive.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am thirsty, thirsty
        for the Lord; the soul-bride gazes upon Him all through the night.
        My mind is absorbed into the Lord, my Lord and Master. Only God
        knows the pain of another.  || 1 ||   My body suffers in pain,
        without the Lord; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        I find the Lord. O Dear Lord, please be kind and compassionate
        to me, that I might remain merged in You, O Lord.  || 2 ||   Follow
        such a path, O my conscious mind, that you may remain focused
        on the Feet of the Lord. I am wonder-struck, singing the Glorious
        Praises of my Fascinating Lord; I am intuitively absorbed in the
        Fearless Lord.  || 3 ||   That heart, in which the Eternal, Unchanging
        Naam vibrates and resounds, does not diminish, and cannot be evaluated.
        Without the Name, everyone is poor; the True Guru has imparted
        this understanding.  || 4 ||   My Beloved is my breath of life
        - listen, O my companion. The demons have taken poison
        and died. As love for Him welled up, so it remains. My mind is
        imbued with His Love.  || 5 ||   I am absorbed in celestial samaadhi,
        lovingly attached to the Lord forever. I live by singing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord. Imbued with the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, I have become detached from the world. In the profound
        primal trance, I dwell within the home of my own inner being.
        || 6 ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is sublimely sweet
        and supremely delicious; within the home of my own self, I understand
        the essence of the Lord. Wherever You keep my mind, there it is.
        This is what the Guru has taught me.  || 7 ||   Sanak and Sanandan,
        Brahma and Indra, were imbued with devotional worship, and came
        to be in harmony with Him. O Nanak, without the Lord, I cannot
        live, even for an instant. The Name of the Lord is glorious and
        great.  || 8 || 1 ||   SAARANG,  FIRST MEHL:  Without the Lord,
        how can my mind be comforted? The guilt and sin of millions of
        ages is erased, and one is released from the cycle of reincarnation,
        when the Truth is implanted within.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Anger
        is gone, egotism and attachment have been burnt away; I am imbued
        with His ever-fresh Love. Other fears are forgotten, begging at
        God's Door. The Immaculate Lord is my Companion.  || 1
        ||   Forsaking my fickle intellect, I have found God, the Destroyer
        of fear; I am lovingly attuned to the One Word, the Shabad. Tasting
        the sublime essence of the Lord, my thirst is quenched; by great
        good fortune, the Lord has united me with Himself.  || 2 || <br>

      <p> The empty tank has been filled to overflowing. Following the Guru's

        the beginning of time, and througout the ages.  || 3 ||   My mind
        is fascinated with the Fascinating Lord. By great good fortune,
        I am lovingly attuned to Him. Contemplating the True Lord, all
        the resides of sins and mistakes are wiped away. My mind is pure
        and immaculate in His Love.  || 4 ||   God is the Deep and Unfathomable
        Ocean, the Source of all jewels; no other is worthy of worship.
        I contemplate the Shabad, the Destroyer of doubt and fear; I do
        not know any other at all.  || 5 ||   Subduing my mind, I have
        realized the pure status; I am totally imbued with the sublime
        essence of the Lord. I do not know any other except the Lord.
        The True Guru has imparted this understanding.  || 6 ||   God
        is Inaccessible and Unfathomable, Unmastered and Unborn; through
        the Guru's Teachings, I know the One Lord. Filled to overflowing,
        my consciousness does not waver; through the Mind, my mind is
        pleased and appeased.  || 7 ||   By Guru's Grace, I speak
        the Unspoken; I speak what He makes me speak. O Nanak, my Lord
        is Merciful to the meek; I do not know any other at all.  || 8

        Name, I have attained liberation and emancipation.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Through the Word of the Shabad, I am lovingly attuned to
        the Lord, the Destroyer of fear, the Destroyer of the Messenger
        of Death. As Gurmukh, I have realized the Lord, the Giver of peace;
        I remain intuitively absorbed in Him.  || 1 ||   The Immaculate
        Name of the Lord is the food of His devotees; they wear the glory
        of devotional worship. They abide in the home of their inner beings,
        and they serve the Lord forever; they are honored in the Court
        of the Lord.  || 2 ||   The intellect of the self-willed manmukh
        is false; his mind wavers and wobbles, and he cannot speak the
        Unspoken Speech. Following the Guru's Teachings, the Eternal
        Unchanging Lord abides within the mind; the True Word of His Bani
        is Ambrosial Nectar.  || 3 ||   The Shabad calms the turbulent
        waves of the mind; the tongue is intuively imbued with peace.
        So remain united forever with your True Guru, who is lovingly
        attuned to the Lord.  || 4 ||   If the mortal dies in the Shabad,
        then he is liberated; he focuses his consciousness on the Lord's
        Feet. The Lord is an Ocean; His Water is Forever Pure. Whoever
        bathes in it is intuitively imbued with peace.  || 5 ||   Those
        who contemplate the Shabad are forever imbued with His Love; their
        egotism and desires are subdued. The Pure, Unattached Lord permeates
        their inner beings; the Lord, the Supreme Soul, is pervading all.
        || 6 ||   Your humble servants serve You, O Lord; those who are
        imbued with the Truth are pleasing to Your Mind. Those who are
        involved in duality do not find the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence; caught in the false nature of the world, they do not
        discriminate between merits and demerits.  || 7 ||   When the
        Lord merges us into Himself, we speak the Unspoken Speech; True
        is the Shabad, and True is the Word of His Bani. O Nanak, the
        true people are absorbed in the Truth; they chant the Name of
        the Lord.  || 8 || 1 ||   SAARANG,  THIRD MEHL:  O my mind, the
        Name of the Lord is supremely sweet. <br>

        the mind comes to love the True Lord. I do not know any other,
        except the Lord; the True Guru has revealed the One Lord to me.
        || 1 ||   Those whose hearts are filled with the wealth of the
        Lord's Love, remain intuitively absorbed in Him. Imbued

        Love. They are imbued with the Lord's celestial peace and
        poise.  || 2 ||   Contemplating the Shabad, the tongue is imbued
        with joy; embracing His Love, it is dyed a deep crimson. I have
        come to know the Name of the Pure Detached Lord; my mind is satisfied
        and comforted.  || 3 ||   The Pandits, the religious scholars,
        read and study, and all the silent sages have grown weary; they
        have grown weary of wearing their religious robes and wandering
        all around. By Guru's Grace, I have found the Immaculate
        Lord; I contemplate the True Word of the Shabad.  || 4 ||   My
        coming and going in reincarnation is ended, and I am imbued with
        Truth; the True Word of the Shabad is pleasing to my mind. Serving
        the True Guru, eternal peace is found, and self-conceit is eliminated
        from within.  || 5 ||   Through the True Word of the Shabad, the
        celestial melody wells up, and the mind is lovingly focused on
        the True Lord. The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Inaccessible
        and Unfathomable Lord, abides in the mind of the Gurmukh.  ||
        6 ||   The whole world is contained in the One Lord. How rare
        are those who understand the One Lord. One who dies in the Shabad
        comes to know everything; night and day, he realizes the One Lord.
        || 7 ||   That humble being, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance
        of Grace, understands. Nothing else can be said. O Nanak, those
        who are imbued with the Naam are forever detached from the world;
        they are lovingly attuned to the One Word of the Shabad.  || 8
        || 2 ||   SAARANG,  THIRD MEHL:  O my mind, the Speech of the
        Lord is unspoken. That humble being who is blessed by the Lord's
        Glance of Grace, obtains it. How rare is that Gurmukh who understands.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is Deep, Profound and Unfathomable,
        the Ocean of Excellence; He is realized through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad. Mortals do their deeds in all sorts of ways,
        in the love of duality; but without the Shabad, they are insane.
        || 1 ||   That humble being who bathes in the Lord's Name
        becomes immaculate; he never becomes polluted again. Without the
        Name, the whole world is polluted; wandering in duality, it loses
        its honor.  || 2 ||   What should I grasp? What should I gather
        up or leave behind? I do not know. O Dear Lord, Your Name is the
        Help and Support of those whom You bless with Your kindness and
        compassion.  || 3 ||   The True Lord is the True Giver, the Architect
        of Destiny; as He pleases, He links mortals to the Name. He alone
        comes to understand, who enters the Guru's Gate, whom the
        Lord Himself instructs.  || 4 ||   Even gazing upon the wonders
        of the Lord, this mind does not think of Him. The world comes
        and goes in reincarnation. Serving the True Guru, the mortal comes
        to understand, and finds the Door of Salvation.  || 5 ||   Those
        who understand the Lord's Court, never suffer separation
        from him. The True Guru has imparted this understanding. They
        practice truth, self-restraint and good deeds; their comings and
        goings are ended.  || 6 ||   In the Court of the True Lord, they
        practice Truth. The Gurmukhs take the Support of the True Lord. <br>

      <p> The self-willed manmukhs wander, lost in doubt and duality. They
        do not know how to contemplate the Lord.  || 7 ||   He Himself
        is the Gurmukh, and He Himself gives; He Himself creates and beholds.
        O Nanak, those humble beings are approved, whose honor the Lord
        Himself accepts.  || 8 || 3 || <br>

        Destroyer. You are the Sovereign Lord of all.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The rulers and nobles and kings shall become beggars. Their
        ostentatious shows are false. My Sovereign Lord King is eternally
        stable. His Praises are sung in every heart.  || 1 ||   Listen
        to the Praises of my Lord King, O Saints. I chant them as best
        I can. My Lord King, the Great Giver, is Immeasurable. He is the
        Highest of the high.  || 2 ||   He has strung His Breath throughout
        the creation; He locked the fire in the wood. He placed the water
        and the land together, but neither blends with the other.  ||
        3 ||   In each and every heart, the Story of our Sovereign Lord
        is told; in each and every home, they yearn for Him. Afterwards,
        He created all beings and creatures; but first, He provided them
        with sustenance.  || 4 ||   Whatever He does, He does by Himself.
        Who has ever given Him advice? The mortals make all sorts of efforts
        and showy displays, but He is realized only through the Teachings
        of Truth.  || 5 ||   The Lord protects and saves His devotees;
        He blesses them with the glory of His Name. Whoever is disrespectful
        to the humble servant of the Lord, shall be swept away and destroyed.
        || 6 ||   Those who join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, are liberated; all their demerits are taken away. Seeing
        them, God becomes merciful; they are carried across the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 7 ||   I am lowly, I am nothing at all; You are
        my Great Lord and Master - how can I even contemplate Your
        creative potency? My mind and body are cooled and soothed, gazing
        upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. Nanak takes
        the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 8 || 1 || <br>

        worship and adore the Lord, Har, Har. What praise, and what approval,
        can I offer to Him?  || 2 ||   I ask the Saints, what is my Lord
        and Master like? I offer my heart, to one who brings me news of

        He is the Giver of peace to life and limb; God is totally permeating

        I humbly ask, what is my Lord and Master like?  || 3 ||   In His
        Kindness, He has come to His humble servant. Blessed is that heart,
        in which the Lord's Feet are enshrined. His Feet are enshrined
        within, in the Society of the Saints; the darkness of ignorance
        is dispelled. The heart is enlightened and illumined and enraptured;
        God has been found. Pain is gone, and peace has come to my house.

      <p> <font color="#000000">SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  The key of the Guru
        opens the lock of attachment, in the house of the mind, under
        the roof of the body. O Nanak, without the Guru, the door of the
        mind cannot be opened. No one else holds the key in hand. || 1
        ||   FIRST MEHL:  He is not won over by music, songs or the Vedas.
        He is not won over by intuitive wisdom, meditation or Yoga. He
        is not won over by feeling sad and depressed forever. He is not
        won over by beauty, wealth and pleasures. He is not won over by
        wandering naked at sacred shrines. He is not won over by giving
        donations in charity. He is not won over by living alone in the
        wilderness. He is not won over by fighting and dying as a warrior
        in battle. He is not won over by becoming the dust of the masses.
        The account is written of the loves of the mind. O Nanak, the
        Lord is won over only by His Name. || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  You
        may study the nine grammars, the six Shaastras and the six divions
        of the Vedas. You may recite the Mahaabhaarata. Even these cannot
        find the limits of the Lord. Without the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, how can anyone be liberated? Brahma, in the lotus of the
        navel, does not know the limits of God. The Gurmukh, O Nanak,
        realizes the Naam.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  The Immaculate Lord Himself,
        by Himself, created Himself. He Himself created the whole drama
        of all the world's play. He Himself formed the three gunas,
        the three qualities; He increased the attachment to Maya. By Guru's
        Grace, they are saved - those who love the Will of God. <br>

      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, the True Lord is pervading everywhere; all are contained
        within the True Lord.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  He Himself
        creates, O Nanak; He establishes the various creatures. How can
        anyone be called bad? We have only One Lord and Master. There
        is One Lord and Master of all; He watches over all, and assigns
        all to their tasks. Some have less, and some have more; no one
        is allowed to leave empty. Naked we come, and naked we go; in
        between, we put on a show. O Nanak, one who does not understand
        the Hukam of God's Command - what will he have to
        do in the world hereafter?  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  He sends out
        the various created beings, and he calls back the various created
        beings again. He himself establishes, and He Himself disestablishes.
        He fashions them in various forms. And all the human beings who
        wander around as beggars, He Himself gives in charity to them.
        As it is recorded, the mortals speak, and as it is recorded, they
        walk. So why put on all this show? This is the basis of intelligence;
        this is certified and approved. Nanak speaks and proclaims it.
        By past actions, each being is judged; what else can anyone say?
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Guru's Word makes the drama play
        itself out. Through virtue, this becomes evident. Whoever utters
        the Word of the Guru's Bani - the Lord is enshrined
        in his mind. Maya's power is gone, and doubt is eradicated;
        awaken to the Light of the Lord. Those who hold onto goodness
        as their treasure meet the Guru, the Primal Being. O Nanak, they
        are intuitively absorbed and blended into the Name of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  The merchants come from the
        Banker; He sends the account of their destiny with them. On the
        basis of their accounts, He issues the Hukam of His Command, and
        they are left to take care of their merchandise. The merchants
        have purchased their merchandise and packed up their cargo. Some
        depart after having earned a good profit, while others leave,
        having lost their investment altogether. No one asks to have less;
        who should be celebrated? The Lord casts His Glance of Grace,
        O Nanak, upon those who have preserved their capital investment.
        || 1 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  United, the united separate,
        and separated, they unite again. Living, the living die, and dying,
        they live again. They become the fathers of many, and the sons
        of many; they become the gurus of many, and the disciples. No
        account can be made of the future or the past; who knows what
        shall be, or what was? All the actions and events of the past
        are recorded; the Doer did, He does, and He will do. The self-willed
        manmukh dies, while the Gurmukh is saved; O Nanak, the Gracious
        Lord bestows His Glance of Grace.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The self-willed
        manmukh wanders in duality, lured and enticed by duality. He practices
        falsehood and deception, telling lies. Love and attachment to
        children and spouse is total misery and pain. He is gagged and
        bound at the door of the Messenger of Death; he dies, and wanders
        lost in reincarnation. The self-willed manmukh wastes his life;
        Nanak loves the Lord.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  Those
        who are blessed with the glorious greatness of Your Name -
        their minds are imbued with Your Love. O Nanak, there is only
        One Ambrosial Nectar; there is no other nectar at all. O Nanak,
        the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained within the mind, by Guru's
        Grace. <br>

      </p>
      <p> They alone drink it in with love, who have such pre-ordained destiny.
        || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Why praise the created being? Praise
        the One who created all. O Nanak, there is no other Giver, except
        the One Lord. Praise the Creator Lord, who created the creation.
        Praise the Great Giver, who gives sustenence to all. O Nanak,
        the treasure of the Eternal Lord is over-flowing. Praise and honor
        the One, who has no end or limitation.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The
        Name of the Lord is a treasure. Serving it, peace is obtained.
        I chant the Name of the Immaculate Lord, so that I may go home
        with honor. The Word of the Gurmukh is the Naam; I enshrine the
        Naam within my heart. The bird of the intellect comes under one's
        control, by meditating on the True Guru. O Nanak, if the Lord
        becomes merciful, the mortal lovingly tunes in to the Naam.  ||
        4 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  How can we speak of Him? Only He
        knows Himself. His decree cannot be challenged; He is our Supreme
        Lord and Master. By His Decree, even kings, nobles and commanders
        must step down. Whatever is pleasing to His Will, O Nanak, is
        a good deed. By His Decree, we walk; nothing rests in our hands.
        When the Order comes from our Lord and Master, all must rise up
        and take to the road. As His Decree is issued, so is His Command
        obeyed. Those who are sent, come, O Nanak; when they are called
        back, they depart and go.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Those whom
        the Lord blesses with His Praises, are the true keepers of the
        treasure. Those who are blessed with the key - they alone
        receive the treasure. That treasure, from which virtue wells up
        - that treasure is approved. Those who are blessed by His
        Glance of Grace, O Nanak, bear the Insignia of the Naam.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is immaculate and
        pure; hearing it, peace is obtained. Listening and hearing, It
        is enshrined in the mind; how rare is that humble being who realizes
        it. Sitting down and standing up, I shall never forget Him, the
        Truest of the true. His devotees have the Support of His Name;
        in His Name, they find peace. O Nanak, He permeates and pervades
        mind and body; He is the Lord, the Guru's Word.  || 5 ||
        SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, the weight is weighed out, when
        the soul is placed on the scale. Nothing is equal to speaking
        of the One, who perfectly unites us with the Perfect Lord. To
        call Him glorious and great carries such a heavy weight. Other
        intellectualisms are lightweight; other words are lightweight
        as well. The weight of the earth, water and mountains -
        how can the goldsmith weigh it on the scale? What weights can
        balance the scale? O Nanak, when questioned, the answer is given.
        The blind fool is running around, leading the blind. The more
        they say, the more they expose themselves.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        It is difficult to chant it; it is difficult to listen to it.
        It cannot be chanted with the mouth. Some speak with their mouths
        and chant the Word of the Shabad - the low and the high,
        day and night. If He were something, then He would be visible.
        His form and state cannot be seen. The Creator Lord does all deeds;
        He is established in the hearts of the high and the low. <br>

      </p>
      <p> It is so difficult to chant it, O Nanak; it cannot be chanted
        with the mouth.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Hearing the Name, the mind
        is delighted. The Name brings peace and tranquility. Hearing the
        Name, the mind is satisfied, and all pains are taken away. Hearing
        the Name, one becomes famous; the Name brings glorious greatness.
        The Name brings all honor and status; through the Name, salvation
        is obtained. The Gurmukh meditates on the Name; Nanak is lovingly
        attuned to the Name.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Impurity
        does not come from music; impurity does not come from the Vedas.
        Impurity does not come from the phases of the sun and the moon.
        Impurity does not come from food; impurity does not come from
        ritual cleansing baths. Impurity does not come from the rain,
        which falls everywhere. Impurity does not come from the earth;
        impurity does not come from the water. Impurity does not come
        from the air which is diffused everywhere. O Nanak, the one who
        has no Guru, has no redeeming virtues at all. Impurity comes from
        turning one's face away from God.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        O Nanak, the mouth is truly cleansed by ritual cleansing, if
        you really know how to do it. For the intuitively aware, cleansing
        is spiritual wisdom. For the Yogi, it is self-control. For the
        Brahmin, cleansing is contentment; for the householder, it is
        truth and charity. For the king, cleansing is justice; for the
        scholar, it is true meditation. The consciousness is not washed
        with water; you drink it to quench your thirst. Water is the father
        of the world; in the end, water destroys it all.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Hearing the Name, all supernatural spiritual powers are obtained,
        and wealth follows along. Hearing the Name, the nine treasures
        are received, and the mind's desires are obtained. Hearing
        the Name, contentment comes, and Maya meditates at one's
        feet. Hearing the Name, intuitive peace and poise wells up. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, the Name is obtained; O Nanak, sing
        His Glorious Praises.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  In pain,
        we are born; in pain, we die. In pain, we deal with the world.
        Hereafter, there is said to be pain, only pain; the more the mortals
        read, the more they cry out. The packages of pain are untied,
        but peace does not emerge. In pain, the soul burns; in pain, it
        departs weeping and wailing. O Nanak, imbued with the Lord's
        Praise, the mind and body blossom forth, rejuvenated. In the fire
        of pain, the mortals die; but pain is also the cure.  || 1 ||
        FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, worldly pleasures are nothing more than
        dust. They are the dust of the dust of ashes. The mortal earns
        only the dust of the dust; his body is covered with dust. When
        the soul is taken out of the body, it too is covered with dust.
        And when one's account is called for in the world hereafter,
        he receives only ten times more dust.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Hearing
        the Name, one is blessed with purity and self-control, and the
        Messenger of Death will not draw near. Hearing the Name, the heart
        is illumined, and darkness is dispelled. Hearing the Name, one
        comes to understand his own self, and the profit of the Name is
        obtained. Hearing the Name, sins are eradicated, and one meets
        the Immaculate True Lord. O Nanak, hearing the Name, one's
        face becomes radiant. As Gurmukh, meditate on the Name.  || 8
        ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  In your home, is the Lord God, along
        with all your other gods. </p>
