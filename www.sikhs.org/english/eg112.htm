      <p> No one, not even the kings and queens, shall remain.  || 1 ||
        The Sovereign Lord is the nine treasures for me. The possessions
        and the spouse to which the mortal is lovingly attached, are Your
        wealth, O Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They do not come with the
        mortal, and they do not go with him. What good does it do him,
        if he has elephants tied up at his doorway?  || 2 ||   The fortress
        of Sri Lanka was made out of gold, but what could the foolish
        Raawan take with him when he left?  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, think
        of doing some good deeds. In the end, the gambler shall depart
        empty-handed.  || 4 || 2 ||   Brahma is polluted, and Indra is
        polluted. The sun is polluted, and the moon is polluted.  || 1
        ||   This world is polluted with pollution. Only the One Lord
        is Immaculate; He has no end or limitation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The rulers of kingdoms are polluted. Nights and days, and the
        days of the month are polluted.  || 2 ||   The pearl is polluted,
        the diamond is polluted. Wind, fire and water are polluted.  ||
        3 ||   Shiva, Shankara and Mahaysh are polluted. The Siddhas,
        seekers and strivers, and those who wear religious robes, are
        polluted.  || 4 ||   The Yogis and wandering hermits with their
        matted hair are polluted. The body, along with the swan-soul,
        is polluted.  || 5 ||   Says Kabeer, those humble beings are approved
        and pure, who know the Lord.  || 6 || 3 ||   Let your mind be
        Mecca, and your body the temple of worship. Let the Supreme Guru
        be the One who speaks.  || 1 ||   O Mullah, utter the call to
        prayer. The one mosque has ten doors.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So
        slaughter your evil nature, doubt and cruelty; consume the five
        demons and you shall be blessed with contentment.  || 2 ||   Hindus
        and Muslims have the same One Lord and Master. What can the Mullah
        do, and what can the Shaykh do?  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, I have
        gone insane. Slaughtering, slaughtering my mind, I have merged
        into the Celestial Lord.  || 4 || 4 ||   When the stream flows
        into the Ganges, then it becomes the Ganges.  || 1 ||   Just so,
        Kabeer has become the Lord. He has become the Embodiment of Truth,
        and he does not go anywhere else.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Associating
        with the sandalwood tree, the tree nearby is changed; that tree
        begins to smell just like the sandalwood tree.  || 2 ||   Coming
        into contact with the philosophers' stone, copper is transformed;
        that copper is transformed into gold.  || 3 ||   In the Society
        of the Saints, Kabeer is transformed; that Kabeer is transformed
        into the Lord.  || 4 || 5 ||   Some apply ceremonial marks to
        their foreheads, hold malas in their hands, and wear religious
        robes. Some people think that the Lord is a play-thing.  || 1
        ||   If I am insane, then I am Yours, O Lord. How can people know
        my secret?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I do not pick leaves as offerings,
        and I do not worship idols. Without devotional worship of the
        Lord, service is useless.  || 2 ||   I worship the True Guru;
        forever and ever, I surrender to Him. By such service, I find
        peace in the Court of the Lord.  || 3 ||   People say that Kabeer
        has gone insane. Only the Lord realizes the secret of Kabeer.
        || 4 || 6 ||   Turning away from the world, I have forgotten
        both my social class and ancestry. My weaving now is in the most
        profound celestial stillness.  || 1 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> I have no quarrel with anyone. I have abandoned both the Pandits,
        the Hindu religious scholars, and the Mullahs, the Muslim priests.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I weave and weave, and wear what I weave.
        Where egotism does not exist, there I sing God's Praises.
        || 2 ||   Whatever the Pandits and Mullahs have written, I reject;
        I do not accept any of it.  || 3 ||   My heart is pure, and so
        I have seen the Lord within. Searching, searching within the self,
        Kabeer has met the Lord.  || 4 || 7 ||   No one respects the poor
        man. He may make thousands of efforts, but no one pays any attention
        to him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When the poor man goes to the rich
        man, and sits right in front of him, the rich man turns his back
        on him.  || 1 ||   But when the rich man goes to the poor man,
        the poor man welcomes him with respect.  || 2 ||   The poor man
        and the rich man are both brothers. God's pre-ordained
        plan cannot be erased.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, he alone is poor,
        who does not have the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in his heart.
        || 4 || 8 ||   Serving the Guru, devotional worship is practiced.
        Then, this human body is obtained. Even the gods long for this
        human body. So vibrate that human body, and think of serving the
        Lord.  || 1 ||   Vibrate, and meditate on the Lord of the Universe,
        and never forget Him. This is the blessed opportunity of this
        human incarnation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As long as the disease
        of old age has not come to the body, and as long as death has
        not come and seized the body, and as long as your voice has not
        lost its power, O mortal being, vibrate and meditate on the Lord
        of the World.  || 2 ||   If you do not vibrate and meditate on
        Him now, when will you, O Sibing of Destiny? When the end comes,
        you will not be able to vibrate and meditate on Him. Whatever
        you have to do - now is the best time to do it. Otherwise,
        you shall regret and repent afterwards, and you shall not be carried
        across to the other side.  || 3 ||   He alone is a servant, whom
        the Lord enjoins to His service. He alone attains the Immaculate
        Divine Lord. Meeting with the Guru, his doors are opened wide,
        and he does not have to journey again on the path of reincarnation.
        || 4 ||   This is your chance, and this is your time. Look deep
        into your own heart, and reflect on this. Says Kabeer, you can
        win or lose. In so many ways, I have proclaimed this out loud.
        || 5 || 1 || 9 ||   In the City of God, sublime understanding
        prevails. There, you shall meet with the Lord, and reflect on
        Him. Thus, you shall understand this world and the next. What
        is the use of claiming that you own everything, if you only die
        in the end?  || 1 ||   I focus my meditation on my inner self,
        deep within. The Name of the Sovereign Lord is my spiritual wisdom.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the first chakra, the root chakra, I
        have grasped the reins and tied them. I have firmly placed the
        moon above the sun. The sun blazes forth at the western gate.
        Through the central channel of the Shushmanaa, it rises up above
        my head.  || 2 ||   There is a stone at that western gate, and
        above that stone, is another window. Above that window is the
        Tenth Gate. Says Kabeer, it has no end or limitation.  || 3 ||
        2 || 10 ||   He alone is a Mullah, who struggles with his mind,
        and through the Guru's Teachings, fights with death. He
        crushes the pride of the Messenger of Death. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Unto that Mullah, I ever offer greetings of respect.  || 1 ||
        God is present, right here at hand; why do you say that He is
        far away? Tie up your disturbing passions, and find the Beauteous
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He alone is a Qazi, who contemplates
        the human body, and through the fire of the body, is illumined
        by God. He does not lose his semen, even in his dreams; for such
        a Qazi, there is no old age or death.  || 2 ||   He alone is a
        sultan and a king, who shoots the two arrows, gathers in his outgoing
        mind, and assembles his army in the realm of the mind's
        sky, the Tenth Gate. The canopy of royalty waves over such a sultan.
        || 3 ||   The Yogi cries out, &quot;Gorakh, Gorakh&quot;.
        The Hindu utters the Name of Raam. The Muslim has only One God.
        The Lord and Master of Kabeer is all-pervading.  || 4 || 3 ||
        11 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Those who call a stone their god -
        their service is useless. Those who fall at the feet of a stone
        god - their work is wasted in vain.  || 1 ||   My Lord
        and Master speaks forever. God gives His gifts to all living beings.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Divine Lord is within the self, but
        the spiritually blind one does not know this. Deluded by doubt,
        he is caught in the noose. The stone does not speak; it does not
        give anything to anyone. Such religious rituals are useless; such
        service is fruitless.  || 2 ||   If a corpse is anointed with
        sandalwood oil, what good does it do? If a corpse is rolled in
        manure, what does it lose from this?  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, I
        proclaim this out loud - behold, and understand, you ignorant,
        faithless cynic. The love of duality has ruined countless homes.
        The Lord's devotees are forever in bliss.  || 4 || 4 ||
        12 ||   The fish in the water is attached to Maya. The moth fluttering
        around the lamp is pierced through by Maya. The sexual desire
        of Maya afflicts the elephant. The snakes and bumble bees are
        destroyed through Maya.  || 1 ||   Such are the enticements of
        Maya, O Siblings of Destiny. As many living beings are there are,
        have been deceived.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The birds and the deer
        are imbued with Maya. Sugar is a deadly trap for the flies. Horses
        and camels are absorbed in Maya. The eighty-four Siddhas, the
        beings of miraculous spiritual powers, play in Maya.  || 2 ||
        The six celibates are slaves of Maya. So are the nine masters
        of Yoga, and the sun and the moon. The austere disciplinarians
        and the Rishis are asleep in Maya. Death and the five demons are
        in Maya.  || 3 ||   Dogs and jackals are imbued with Maya. Monkeys,
        leopards and lions, cats, sheep, foxes, trees and roots are planted
        in Maya.  || 4 ||   Even the gods are drenched with Maya, as are
        the oceans, the sky and the earth. Says Kabeer, whoever has a
        belly to fill, is under the spell of Maya. The mortal is emancipated
        only when he meets the Holy Saint.  || 5 || 5 || 13 ||   As long
        as he cries out, &quot;Mine! Mine!&quot;, none of his tasks
        is accomplished. <br>

      </p>
      <p> When such possessiveness is erased and removed, then God comes
        and resolves his affairs.  || 1 ||   Contemplate such spiritual
        wisdom, O mortal man. Why not meditate in remembrance on the Lord,
        the Destroyer of pain?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As long as the tiger
        lives in the forest, the forest does not flower. But when the
        jackal eats the tiger, then the entire forest flowers.  || 2 ||
        The victorious are drowned, while the defeated swim across.
        By Guru's Grace, one crosses over and is saved. Slave Kabeer
        speaks and teaches: remain lovingly absorbed, attuned to the Lord
        alone.  || 3 || 6 || 14 ||   He has 7,000 commanders, and hundreds
        of thousands of prophets; He is said to have 88,000,000 shaykhs,
        and 56,000,000 attendants.  || 1 ||   I am meek and poor -
        what chance do I have of being heard there? His Court is so far
        away; only a rare few attain the Mansion of His Presence.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   He has 33,000,000 play-houses. His beings wander
        insanely through 8.4 million incarnations. He bestowed His Grace
        on Adam, the father of mankind, who then lived in paradise for
        a long time.  || 2 ||   Pale are the faces of those whose hearts
        are disturbed. They have forsaken their Bible, and practice Satanic
        evil. One who blames the world, and is angry with people, shall
        receive the fruits of his own actions.  || 3 ||   You are the
        Great Giver, O Lord; I am forever a beggar at Your Door. If I
        were to deny You, then I would be a wretched sinner. Slave Kabeer
        has entered Your Shelter. Keep me near You, O Merciful Lord God
        - that is heaven for me.  || 4 || 7 || 15 ||   Everyone
        speaks of going there, but I do not even know where heaven is.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who does not even know the mystery of
        his own self, speaks of heaven, but it is only talk.  || 1 ||
        As long as the mortal hopes for heaven, he will not dwell at
        the Lord's Feet.  || 2 ||   Heaven is not a fort with moats
        and ramparts, and walls plastered with mud; I do not know what
        heaven's gate is like.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, now what
        more can I say? The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is
        heaven itself.  || 4 || 8 || 16 ||   How can the beautiful fortress
        be conquered, O Siblings of Destiny? It has double walls and triple
        moats.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   It is defended by the five elements,
        the twenty-five categories, attachment, pride, jealousy and the
        awesomely powerful Maya. The poor mortal being does not have the
        strength to conquer it; what should I do now, O Lord?  || 1 ||
        Sexual desire is the window, pain and pleasure are the gate-keepers,
        virtue and sin are the gates. Anger is the great supreme commander,
        full of argument and strife, and the mind is the rebel king there.
        || 2 ||   Their armor is the pleasure of tastes and flavors,
        their helmets are worldly attachments; they take aim with their
        bows of corrupt intellect. The greed that fills their hearts is
        the arrow; with these things, their fortress is impregnable. 
        || 3 ||   But I have made divine love the fuse, and deep meditation
        the bomb; I have launched the rocket of spiritual wisdom. The
        fire of God is lit by intuition, and with one shot, the fortress
        is taken.  || 4 ||   Taking truth and contentment with me, I begin
        the battle and storm both the gates. <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p> In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and by Guru's
        Grace, I have captured the king of the fortress.  || 5 ||   With
        the army of God's devotees, and Shakti, the power of meditation,
        I have snapped the noose of the fear of death. Slave Kabeer has
        climbed to the top of the fortress; I have obtained the eternal,
        imperishable domain.  || 6 || 9 || 17 ||   The mother Ganges is
        deep and profound. Tied up in chains, they took Kabeer there.
        || 1 ||   My mind was not shaken; why should my body be afraid?
        My consciousness remained immersed in the Lotus Feet of the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The waves of the Ganges broke the chains,
        and Kabeer was seated on a deer skin.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer,
        I have no friend or companion. On the water, and on the land,
        the Lord is my Protector.  || 3 || 10 || 18 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">God constructed a fortress, inaccessible and
        unreachable, in which He dwells. There, His Divine Light radiates
        forth. Lightning blazes, and bliss prevails there, where the Eternally
        Young Lord God abides.  || 1 ||   This soul is lovingly attuned
        to the Lord's Name. It is saved from old age and death,
        and its doubt runs away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who believe
        in high and low social classes, only sing songs and chants of
        egotism. The Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad, the Word of
        God, resounds in that place, where the Supreme Lord God abides.
        || 2 ||   He creates planets, solar systems and galaxies; He
        destroys the three worlds, the three gods and the three qualities.
        The Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord God dwells in the heart.
        No one can find the limits or the secrets of the Lord of the World.
        || 3 ||   The Lord shines forth in the plantain flower and the
        sunshine. He dwells in the pollen of the lotus flower. The Lord's
        secret is within the twelve petals of the heart-lotus. The Supreme
        Lord, the Lord of Lakshmi dwells there.  || 4 ||   He is like
        the sky, stretching across the lower, upper and middle realms.
        In the profoundly silent celestial realm, He radiates forth. Neither
        the sun nor the moon are there, but the Primal Immaculate Lord
        celebrates there.  || 5 ||   Know that He is in the universe,
        and in the body as well. Take your cleansing bath in the Mansarovar
        Lake. Chant &quot;Sohang&quot; - &quot;He is me.&quot; 
        He is not affected by either virtue or vice.  || 6 ||   He is
        not affected by either high or low social class, sunshine or shade.
        He is in the Guru's Sanctuary, and nowhere else. He is
        not diverted by diversions, comings or goings. Remain intuitively
        absorbed in the celestial void.  || 7 ||   One who knows the Lord
        in the mind - whatever he says, comes to pass. One who
        firmly implants the Lord's Divine Light, and His Mantra
        within the mind - says Kabeer, such a mortal crosses over
        to the other side.  || 8 || 1 ||   Millions of suns shine for
        Him, millions of Shivas and Kailash mountains. Millions of Durga
        goddesses massage His Feet. Millions of Brahmas chant the Vedas
        for Him.  || 1 ||   When I beg, I beg only from the Lord. I have
        nothing to do with any other deities.  || 1 ||  Pause  || <br>

      <p> Millions of moons twinkle in the sky. Thirty-three million gods
        eat the Lord's offerings. The nine stars, a million times
        over, stand at His Door. Millions of Righteous Judges of Dharma
        are His gate-keepers.  || 2 ||   Millions of winds blow around
        Him in the four directions. Millions of serpents prepare His bed.
        Millions of oceans are His water-carriers. The eighteen million
        loads of vegetation are His Hair.  || 3 ||   Millions of treasurers
        fill His Treasury. Millions of Lakshmis adorn themselves for Him.
        Many millions of vices and virtues look up to Him. Millions of
        Indras serve Him.  || 4 ||   Fifty-six million clouds are His.
        In each and every village, His infinite fame has spread. Wild
        demons with dishevelled hair move about. The Lord plays in countless
        ways.  || 5 ||   Millions of charitable feasts are held in His
        Court, and millions of celestial singers celebrate His victory.
        Millions of sciences all sing His Praises. Even so, the limits
        of the Supreme Lord God cannot be found.  || 6 ||   Rama, with
        millions of monkeys, conquered Raawan's army. Billions
        of Puraanas greatly praise Him; He humbled the pride of Duyodhan.
        || 7 ||   Millions of gods of love cannot compete with Him. He
        steals the hearts of mortal beings. Says Kabeer, please hear me,
        O Lord of the World. I beg for the blessing of fearless dignity.

        my tongue, be imbued with the Lord's Name. Meditate on
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and imbue yourself with this most
        excellent color.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O my tongue, other occupations
        are false. The state of Nirvaanaa comes only through the Lord's
        Name.  || 2 ||   The performance of countless millions of other
        devotions is not equal to even one devotion to the Name of the
        Lord.  || 3 ||   Prays Naam Dayv, this is my occupation. O Lord,
        Your Forms are endless.  || 4 || 1 ||   One who stays away from
        others' wealth and others' spouses - the
        Lord abides near that person.  || 1 ||   Those who do not meditate
        and vibrate on the Lord - I do not even want to see them.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those whose inner beings are not in harmony
        with the Lord, are nothing more than beasts.  || 2 ||   Prays
        Naam Dayv, a man without a nose does not look handsome, even if
        he has the thirty-two beauty marks.  || 3 || 2 ||   Naam Dayv
        milked the brown cow, and brought a cup of milk and a jug of water
        to his family god.  || 1 ||   &quot;Please drink this milk,
        O my Sovereign Lord God. Drink this milk and my mind will be happy.
        Otherwise, my father will be angry with me.&quot;  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Taking the golden cup, Naam Dayv filled it with the ambrosial
        milk, and placed it before the Lord.  || 2 ||   The Lord looked
        upon Naam Dayv and smiled. &quot;This one devotee abides within
        my heart.&quot;  || 3 || <br>

      <p> The Lord drank the milk, and the devotee returned home. Thus did
        Naam Dayv come to receive the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan.  || 4 || 3 ||   I am crazy - the Lord is my Husband.
        I decorate and adorn myself for Him.  || 1 ||   Slander me well,
        slander me well, slander me well, O people. My body and mind are
        united with my Beloved Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Do not engage
        in any arguments or debates with anyone. With your tongue, savor
        the Lord's sublime essence.  || 2 ||   Now, I know within
        my soul, that such an arrangement has been made; I will meet with
        my Lord by the beat of the drum.  || 3 ||   Anyone can praise
        or slander me. Naam Dayv has met the Lord.  || 4 || 4 ||   Sometimes,
        people do not appreciate milk, sugar and ghee. Sometimes, they
        have to beg for bread from door to door. Sometimes, they have
        to pick out the grain from the chaff.  || 1 ||   As the Lord keeps
        us, so do we live, O Siblings of Destiny. The Lord's Glory
        cannot even be described.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sometimes, people
        prance around on horses. Sometimes, they do not even have shoes
        for their feet.  || 2 ||   Sometimes, people sleep on cozy beds
        with white sheets. Sometimes, they do not even have straw to put
        down on the ground.  || 3 ||   Naam Dayv prays, only the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, can save us. One who meets the Guru, is
        carried across to the other side.  || 4 || 5 ||   Laughing and
        playing, I came to Your Temple, O Lord. While Naam Dayv was worshipping,
        he was grabbed and driven out.  || 1 ||   I am of a low social
        class, O Lord; why was I born into a family of fabric dyers? 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I picked up my blanket and went back, to
        sit behind the temple.  || 2 ||   As Naam Dayv uttered the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, the temple turned around to face the Lord's
        humble devotee.  || 3 || 6 || </p>

        his family - just so, the Lord is very dear to Naam Dayv.
        || 1 ||   Naam Dayv is in love with the Lord. He has naturally
        and intuitively become detached from the world.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Like the woman who falls in love with another man, and the
        greedy man who loves only wealth, and the sexually promiscuous
        man who loves women and sex, just so, Naam Dayv is in love with
        the Lord.  || 2 ||   But that alone is real love, which the Lord
        Himself inspires; by Guru's Grace, duality is eradicated.
        Such love never breaks; through it, the mortal remains merged
        in the Lord. Naam Dayv has focused his consciousness on the True
        Name.  || 3 ||   Like the love between the child and its mother,
        so is my mind imbued with the Lord. Prays Naam Dayv, I am in love
        with the Lord. The Lord of the Universe abides within my consciousness.

      <p> The blind fool abandons the wife of his own home, and has an affair
        with another woman. He is like the parrot, who is pleased to see
        the simbal tree; but in the end, he dies, stuck to it.  || 1 ||
        The home of the sinner is on fire. It keeps burning, and the
        fire cannot be extinguished.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He does not
        go to see where the Lord is being worshipped. He abandons the
        Lord's Path, and takes the wrong path. He forgets the Primal
        Lord God, and is caught in the cycle of reincarnation. He throws
        away the Ambrosial Nectar, and gathers poison to eat.  || 2 ||
        He is like the prostitute, who comes to dance, wearing beautiful
        clothes, decorated and adorned. She dances to the beat, exciting
        the breath of those who watch her. But the noose of the Messenger
        of Death is around her neck.  || 3 ||   One who has good karma
        recorded on his forehead, hurries to enter the Guru's Sanctuary.
        Says Naam Dayv, consider this: O Saints, this is the way to cross
        over to the other side.  || 4 || 2 || 8 ||   Sanda and Marka went
        and complained to Harnaakhash, &quot;Your son does not read
        his lessons. We are tired of trying to teach him. He chants the
        Lord's Name, clapping his hands to keep the beat; he has
        spoiled all the other students.  || 1 ||   He chants the Lord's
        Name, and he has enshrined meditative remembrance of the Lord
        within his heart.&quot;  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   &quot;Your father
        the king has conquered the whole world&quot;, said his mother
        the queen. &quot;O Prahlad my son, you do not obey him, so he
        has decided to deal with you in another way.&quot;  || 2 || 
        The council of villians met and resolved to send Prahlaad into
        the life hereafter. Prahlaad was thrown off a mountain, into the
        water, and into a fire, but the Sovereign Lord God saved him,
        by changing the laws of nature.  || 3 ||   Harnaakhash thundered
        with rage and threatened to kill Prahlaad. &quot;Tell me, who
        can save you?&quot;  Prahlaad answered, &quot;The Lord, the
        Master of the three worlds, is contained even in this pillar to
        which I am tied.&quot;  || 4 ||   The Lord who tore Harnaakhash
        apart with His nails proclaimed Himself the Lord of gods and men.
        Says Naam Dayv, I meditate on the Lord, the Man-lion, the Giver
        of fearless dignity.  || 5 || 3 || 9 ||   The Sultan said, &quot;Listen,
        Naam Dayv: let me see the actions of your Lord.&quot;  || 1 ||
        The Sultan arrested Naam Dayv, and said, &quot;Let me see
        your Beloved Lord.&quot;  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   &quot;Bring
        this dead cow back to life. Otherwise, I shall cut off your head
        here and now.&quot;  || 2 ||   Naam Dayv answered, &quot;O
        king, how can this happen? No one can bring the dead back to life.
        || 3 ||   I cannot do anything by my own actions. Whatever the
        Lord does, that alone happens.&quot;  || 4 ||   The arrogant
        king was enraged at this reply. He incited an elephant to attack.
        || 5 ||   Naam Dayv's mother began to cry, and she said,
  &quot;Why don't you abandon your Lord Raam, and worship
        his Lord Allah?&quot;  || 6 ||   Naam Dayv answered, &quot;I
        am not your son, and you are not my mother. Even if my body dies,
        I will still sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.&quot;  ||
        7 ||   The elephant attacked him with his trunk, but Naam Dayv
        was saved, protected by the Lord.  || 8 ||   The king said, &quot;The
        Qazis and the Mullahs bow down to me, but this Hindu has trampled
        my honor.&quot;  || 9 ||   The people pleaded with the king,
  &quot;Hear our prayer, O king. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Here, take Naam Dayv's weight in gold, and release him.&quot;
        || 10 ||   The king replied, &quot;If I take the gold, then
        I will be consigned to hell, by forsaking my faith and gathering
        worldly wealth.&quot;  || 11 ||   With his feet in chains, Naam
        Dayv kept the beat with his hands, singing the Praises of the
        Lord.  || 12 ||   &quot;Even if the Ganges and the Jamunaa rivers
        flow backwards, I will still continue singing the Praises of the
        Lord.&quot;  || 13 ||   Three hours passed, and even then, the
        Lord of the three worlds had not come.  || 14 ||   Playing on
        the instrument of the feathered wings, the Lord of the Universe
        came, mounted on the eagle garura.  || 15 ||   He cherished His
        devotee, and the Lord came, mounted on the eagle garura.  || 16
        ||   The Lord said to him, &quot;If you wish, I shall turn the
        earth sideways. If you wish, I shall turn it upside down.  ||
        17 ||   If you wish, I shall bring the dead cow back to life.
        Everyone will see and be convinced.&quot;  || 18 ||   Naam Dayv
        prayed, and milked the cow. He brought the calf to the cow, and
        milked her.  || 19 ||   When the pitcher was filled with milk,
        Naam Dayv took it and placed it before the king.  || 20 ||   The
        king went into his palace, and his heart was troubled.  || 21
        ||   Through the Qazis and the Mullahs, the king offered his prayer,
  &quot;Forgive me, please, O Hindu; I am just a cow before you.&quot;
        || 22 ||   Naam Dayv said, &quot;Listen, O king: have I done
        this miracle?  || 23 ||   The purpose of this miracle is that
        you, O king, should walk on the path of truth and humility.&quot;
        || 24 ||   Naam Dayv became famous everywhere for this. The Hindus
        all went together to Naam Dayv.  || 25 ||   If the cow had not
        been revived, people would have lost faith in Naam Dayv.  || 26
        ||   The fame of Naam Dayv spread throughout the world. The humble
        devotees were saved and carried across with him.  || 27 ||   All
        sorts of troubles and pains afflicted the slanderer. There is
        no difference between Naam Dayv and the Lord.  || 28 || 1 || 10

        the seven nether worlds are Your sandals. The body covered with
        skin is Your temple; You are so beautiful, O Lord of the World.
        || 1 ||   The fifty-six million clouds are Your gowns, the 16,000
        milkmaids are your skirts. The eighteen loads of vegetation is
        Your stick, and all the world is Your plate.  || 2 ||   The human
        body is the mosque, and the mind is the priest, who peacefully
        leads the prayer. You are married to Maya, O Formless Lord, and
        so You have taken form.  || 3 ||   Performing devotional worship
        services to You, my cymbals were taken away; unto whom should
        I complain? Naam Dayv's Lord and Master, the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts, wanders everywhere; He has no specific
        home.  || 4 || 1 || </font><br>
