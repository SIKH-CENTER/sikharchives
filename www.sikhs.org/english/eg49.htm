        <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.</b>
        <p> <b>TRUTH IS THE NAME.</b> </p>
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  NO FEAR.  NO HATRED. </p>
        <p> IMAGE OF THE UNDYING.  BEYOND BIRTH.  SELF-EXISTENT. </p>
        <p> BY GURU'S GRACE: </p>
        <p> RAAG  DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FOURTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Those who become the humble servants of the Lord and Master, lovingly
        focus their minds on Him. Those who chant Your Praises, through
        the Guru's Teachings, have great good fortune recorded upon their
        foreheads.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The bonds and shackles of Maya
        are shattered, by lovingly focusing their minds on the Name of
        the Lord. My mind is enticed by the Guru, the Enticer; beholding
        Him, I am wonder-struck.  || 1 ||   I slept through the entire
        dark night of my life, but through the tiniest bit of the Guru's
        Grace, I have been awakened. O Beautiful Lord God, Master of servant
        Nanak, there is none comparable to You.  || 2 || 1 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:
        Tell me  -  on what path will I find my Beauteous Lord? O
        Saints of the Lord, show me the Way, and I shall follow.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   I cherish in my heart the Words of my Beloved;
        this is the best way. The bride may be hunch-backed and short,
        but if she is loved by her Lord Master, she becomes beautiful,
        and she melts in the Lord's embrace.  || 1 ||   There is
        only the One Beloved  -  we are all soul-brides of our Husband
        Lord. She who is pleasing to her Husband Lord is good. What can
        poor, helpless Nanak do? As it pleases the Lord, so does he walk.
        || 2 || 2 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  O my mind, chant the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, Har. The Gurmukh is imbued with the deep red
        color of the poppy. His shawl is saturated with the Lord's
        Love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I wander around here and there, like
        a madman, bewildered, seeking out my Darling Lord. I shall be
        the slave of the slave of whoever unites me with my Darling Beloved.
        || 1 ||   So align yourself with the Almighty True Guru; drink
        in and savor the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord. By Guru's
        Grace, servant Nanak has obtained the wealth of the Lord within.
        || 2 || 3 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  Now, I have come, exhausted,
        to my Lord and Master. Now that I have come seeking Your Sanctuary,
        God, please, either save me, or kill me. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p> || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have burnt in the fire the clever devices
        and praises of the world. Some speak good of me, and some speak
        ill of me, but I have surrendered my body to You.  || 1 ||   Whoever
        comes to Your Sanctuary, O God, Lord and Master, You save by Your
        Merciful Grace. Servant Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, Dear
        Lord; O Lord, please, protect his honor!  || 2 || 4 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:
        I am a sacrifice to one who sings the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord. I live by continuously beholding the Blessed Vision of the
        Holy Guru's Darshan; within His Mind is the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are pure and immaculate, O God, Almighty
        Lord and Master; how can I, the impure one, meet You? I have one
        thing in my mind, and another thing on my lips; I am such a poor,
        unfortunate liar!  || 1 ||   I appear to chant the Lord's
        Name, but within my heart, I am the most wicked of the wicked.
        As it pleases You, save me, O Lord and Master; servant Nanak seeks
        Your Sanctuary.  || 2 || 5 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  Without the
        Name of the Lord, the beautiful are just like the noseless ones.
        Like the son, born into the house of a prostitute, his name is
        cursed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who do not have the Name of
        their Lord and Master within their hearts, are the most wretched,
        deformed lepers. Like the person who has no Guru, they may know
        many things, but they are cursed in the Court of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||   Those, unto whom my Lord Master becomes Merciful, long
        for the feet of the Holy. O Nanak, the sinners become pure, joining
        the Company of the Holy; following the Guru, the True Guru, they
        are emancipated.  || 2 || 6 ||  First Set of Six  || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <center>
        DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> O mother, I focus my consciousness on the Guru's feet. As
        God shows His Mercy, the lotus of my heart blossoms, and forever
        and ever, I meditate on the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One
        Lord is within, and the One Lord is outside; the One Lord is contained
        in all. Within the heart, beyond the heart, and in all places,
        God, the Perfect One, is seen to be permeating.  || 1 ||   So
        many of Your servants and silent sages sing Your Praises, but
        no one has found Your limits. O Giver of peace, Destroyer of pain,
        Lord and Master  -  servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to
        You.  || 2 || 1 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  O mother, whatever is to
        be, shall be. God pervades His pervading creation; one gains,
        while another loses.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sometimes he blossoms
        in bliss, while at other times, he suffers in mourning. Sometimes
        he laughs, and sometimes he weeps. Sometimes he is filled with
        the filth of ego, while at other times, he washes it off in the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||   No one can erase
        the actions of God; I cannot see any other like Him. Says Nanak,
        I am a sacrifice to the Guru; by His Grace, I sleep in peace.
        || 2 || 2 || </p>

      </p>
      <p> DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  O mother, I hear of death, and think of it,
        and I am filled with fear. Renouncing 'mine and yours'
        and egotism, I have sought the Sanctuary of the Lord and Master.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever He says, I accept that as good.
        I do not say &quot;No&quot; to what He says. Let me not forget
        Him, even for an instant; forgetting Him, I die.  || 1 ||   The
        Giver of peace, God, the Perfect Creator, endures my great ignorance.
        I am worthless, ugly and of low birth, O Nanak, but my Husband
        Lord is the embodiment of bliss.  || 2 || 3 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:
        O my mind, chant forever the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
        By singing, hearing and meditating on Him, all, whether of high
        or low status, are saved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is absorbed
        into the One from which he originated, when he understands the
        Way. Wherever this body was fashioned, it was not allowed to remain
        there.  || 1 ||   Peace comes, and fear and doubt are dispelled,
        when God becomes Merciful. Says Nanak, my hopes have been fulfilled,
        renouncing my greed in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
        || 2 || 4 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  O my mind, act as it pleases
        God. Become the lowest of the low, the very least of the tiny,
        and speak in utmost humility.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The many ostentatious
        shows of Maya are useless; I withhold my love from these. As something
        pleases my Lord and Master, in that I find my glory.  || 1 ||
        I am the slave of His slaves; becoming the dust of the feet
        of his slaves, I serve His humble servants. I obtain all peace
        and greatness, O Nanak, living to chant His Name with my mouth.
        || 2 || 5 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  Dear God, by Your Grace, my
        doubts have been dispelled. By Your Mercy, all are mine; I reflect
        upon this in my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Millions of sins are
        erased, by serving You; the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan drives
        away sorrow. Chanting Your Name, I have obtained supreme peace,
        and my anxieties and diseases have been cast out.  || 1 ||   Sexual
        desire, anger, greed, falsehood and slander are forgotten, in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. The ocean of mercy
        has cut away the bonds of Maya; O Nanak, He has saved me. || 2
        || 6 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  All the cleverness of my mind is gone.
        The Lord and Master is the Doer, the Cause of causes; Nanak holds
        tight to His Support.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Erasing my self-conceit,
        I have entered His Sanctuary; these are the Teachings spoken by
        the Holy Guru. Surrendering to the Will of God, I attain peace,
        and the darkness of doubt is dispelled.  || 1 ||   I know that
        You are all-wise, O God, my Lord and Master; I seek Your Sanctuary.
        In an instant, You establish and disestablish; the value of Your
        Almighty Creative Power cannot be estimated.  || 2 || 7 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord God is my praanaa, my breath of life; He
        is the Giver of peace. By Guru's Grace, only a few know Him.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your Saints are Your Beloveds; death does
        not consume them. </p>

      <p> They are dyed in the deep crimson color of Your Love, and they
        are intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord's Name.
        || 1 ||   The greatest sins, and millions of pains and diseases
        are destroyed by Your Gracious Glance, O God. While sleeping and
        waking, Nanak sings the Lord's Name, Har, Har, Har; he falls
        at the Guru's feet.  || 2 || 8 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE, FIFTH
        MEHL:  I have seen that God with my eyes everywhere. The Giver
        of peace, the Giver of souls, His Speech is Ambrosial Nectar.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Saints dispel the darkness of ignorance;
        the Guru is the Giver of the gift of life. Granting His Grace,
        the Lord has made me His own; I was on fire, but now I am cooled.
        || 1 ||   The karma of good deeds, and the Dharma of righteous
        faith, have not been produced in me, in the least; nor has pure
        conduct welled up in me. Renouncing cleverness and self-mortification,
        O Nanak, I fall at the Guru's feet.  || 2 || 9 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Chant the Lord's Name, and earn the profit.
        You shall attain salvation, peace, poise and bliss, and the noose
        of Death shall be cut away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Searching, searching,
        searching and reflecting, I have found that the Lord's Name
        is with the Saints. They alone obtain this treasure, who have
        such pre-ordained destiny.  || 1 ||   They are very fortunate
        and honorable; they are the perfect bankers. They are beautiful,
        so very wise and handsome; O Nanak, purchase the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 2 || 10 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mind,
        why are you so puffed up with egotism? Whatever is seen in this
        foul, impure and filthy world, is only ashes.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Remember the One who created you, O mortal; He is the Support
        of your soul, and the breath of life. One who forsakes Him, and
        attaches himself to another, dies to be reborn; he is such an
        ignorant fool!  || 1 ||   I am blind, mute, crippled and totally
        lacking in understanding; O God, Preserver of all, please preserve
        me! The Creator, the Cause of causes is all-powerful; O Nanak,
        how helpless are His beings!  || 2 || 11 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  God is the nearest of the near. Remember Him, meditate
        on Him, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe,
        day and night, evening and morning.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Redeem
        your body in the invaluable Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Do not delay for an instant,
        even for a moment. Death is keeping you constantly in his vision.
        || 1 ||   Lift me up out of the dark dungeon, O Creator Lord;
        what is there which is not in Your home? Bless Nanak with the
        Support of Your Name, that he may find great happiness and peace.
        || 2 || 12 ||  Second Set of Six  ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  O mind, meet with the Guru, and worship the Naam in adoration.
        You shall obtain peace, poise, bliss, joy and pleasure, and lay
        the foundation of eternal life.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Showing
        His Mercy, the Lord has made me His slave, and shattered the bonds
        of Maya. Through loving devotion, and singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord of the Universe, I have escaped the Path of Death.
        || 1 ||   When he became Merciful, the rust was removed, and
        I found the priceless treasure. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, I am a sacrifice, a hundred thousand times, to my unapproachable,
        unfathomable Lord and Master.  || 2 || 13 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, how fruitful is the birth of one who sings
        the Glories of God, and enshrines love for the Supreme Lord God.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Beautiful, wise, brave and divine is one
        who obtains the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. He chants
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with his tongue, and does not
        have to wander in reincarnation again.  || 1 ||   The Perfect
        Lord God pervades his mind and body; he does not look upon any
        other. Hell and disease do not afflict one who joins the Company
        of the Lord's humble servants, O Nanak; the Lord attaches
        him to the hem of His robe.  || 2 || 14 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  His fickle mind is entangled in a dream. He does
        not even understand this much, that someday he shall have to depart;
        he has gone crazy with Maya.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is engrossed
        in the delight of the flower's color; he strives only to
        indulge in corruption. Hearing about greed, he feels happy in
        his mind, and he runs after it.  || 1 ||   Wandering and roaming
        all around, I have endured great pain, but now, I have come to
        the door of the Saint. Granting His Grace, the Supreme Lord Master
        has blended Nanak with Himself.  || 2 || 15 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  All peace is found in the Guru's feet. They
        drive away my sins and purify my mind; their Support carries me
        across.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This is the labor which I perform:
        worship, flower-offerings, service and devotion. My mind blossoms
        forth and is enlightened, and I am not cast into the womb again.
        || 1 ||   I behold the fruitful vision of the Saint; this is
        the meditation I have taken. The Lord Master has become Merciful
        to Nanak, and he has entered the Sanctuary of the Holy.  || 2
        || 16 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Offer your prayer to
        your Lord. You shall obtain the four blessings, and the treasures
        of bliss, pleasure, peace, poise and the spiritual powers of the
        Siddhas.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Renounce your self-conceit, and
        grasp hold of the Guru's feet; hold tight to the hem of God's
        robe. The heat of the ocean of fire does not affect one who longs
        for the Lord and Master's Sanctuary.  || 1 ||   Again and
        again, God puts up with the millions of sins of the supremely
        ungrateful ones. The embodiment of mercy, the Perfect Transcendent
        Lord  -  Nanak longs for His Sanctuary.  || 2 || 17 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Place the Guru's feet within your heart, and
        all illness, sorrow and pain shall be dispelled; all suffering
        shall come to an end.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The sins of countless
        incarnations are erased, as if one has taken purifying baths at
        millions of sacred shrines. The treasure of the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, is obtained by singing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord of the Universe, and centering one's mind in meditation
        on Him.  || 1 ||   Showing His Mercy, the Lord has made me His
        slave; breaking my bonds, He has saved me. I live by chanting
        and meditating on the Naam, and the Bani of Your Word; slave Nanak
        is a sacrifice to You.  || 2 || 18 ||  Third Set of Six  ||  
        DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, I long to see the Feet
        of God. </p>

      <p> Be Merciful to me, O my Lord and Master, that I might never forsake
        them from my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Applying the dust of
        the feet of the Holy to my face and forehead, I burn away the
        poison of sexual desire and anger. I judge myself to be the lowest
        of all; in this way, I instill peace within my mind.  || 1 ||
        I sing the Glorious Praises of the Imperishable Lord and Master,
        and I shake off all my sins. I have found the gift of the treasure
        of the Naam, O Nanak; I hug it close, and enshrine it in my heart.
        || 2 || 19 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Dear God, I long
        to behold the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I cherish this beautiful
        meditation day and night; You are dearer to me than my soul, dearer
        than life itself.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have studied and contemplated
        the essence of the Shaastras, the Vedas and the Puraanas. Protector
        of the meek, Lord of the breath of life, O Perfect One, carry
        us across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||   Since the very
        beginning, and throughout the ages, the humble devotees have been
        Your servants; in the midst of the world of corruption, You are
        their Support. Nanak longs for the dust of the feet of such humble
        beings; the Transcendent Lord is the Giver of all.  || 2 || 20
        ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Your humble servant, O Lord,
        is intoxicated with Your sublime essence. One who obtains the
        treasure of the Nectar of Your Love, does not renounce it to go

        the Lord's Name, Har, Har; while sleeping, he repeats the
        Lord's Name, Har, Har; he eats the Nectar of the Lord's
        Name as his food. Bathing in the dust of the feet of the Holy
        is equal to taking cleansing baths at the sixty-eight sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage.  || 1 ||   How fruitful is the birth of the Lord's
        humble servant; the Creator is his Father. O Nanak, one who recognizes
        the Perfect Lord God, takes all with him, and saves everyone.
        || 2 || 21 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, without
        the Guru, spiritual wisdom is not obtained. They wander around,
        weeping and crying out in various ways, but the Lord of the World
        does not meet them.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The body is tied up
        with emotional attachment, disease and sorrow, and so it is lured
        into countless reincarnations. He finds no place of rest without
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; to whom should he go
        and cry?  || 1 ||   When my Lord and Master shows His Mercy, we
        lovingly focus our consciousness on the feet of the Holy. The
        most horrible agonies are dispelled in an instant, O Nanak, and
        we merge in the Blessed Vision of the Lord.  || 2 || 22 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord and Master Himself has become Merciful.
        I have been emancipated, and I have become the embodiment of bliss;
        I am the Lord's child  -  He has saved me.  ||  Pause
        ||   With my palms pressed together, I offer my prayer; within
        my mind, I meditate on the Supreme Lord God. Giving me His hand,
        the Transcendent Lord has eradicated all my sins.  || 1 ||   Husband
        and wife join together in rejoicing, celebrating the Victory of
        the Lord Master. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the humble servant
        of the Lord, who emancipates everyone.  || 2 || 23 || </p>

      <p> I offer my prayer to my True Guru. The Destroyer of distress has

        ||   I am a sinner, hypocritical and greedy, but still, He puts
        up with all of my merits and demerits. Placing His hand on my
        forehead, He has exalted me. The wicked ones who wanted to destroy
        me have been killed.  || 1 ||   He is generous and benevolent,
        the beautifier of all, the embodiment of peace; the Blessed Vision
        of His Darshan is so fruitful! Says Nanak, He is the Giver to
        the unworthy; I enshrine His Lotus Feet within my heart.  || 2
        || 24 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  My God is the Master
        of the masterless. I have come to the Sanctuary of the Savior
        Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   Protect me on all sides, O Lord; protect
        me in the future, in the past, and at the very last moment.  ||
        1 ||   Whenever something comes to mind, it is You. Contemplating
        Your virtues, my mind is sanctified.  || 2 ||   I hear and sing
        the Hymns of the Guru's Word. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice
        to the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy.  || 3 ||   Within
        my mind, I have the Support of the One Lord alone. O Nanak, my
        God is the Creator of all.  || 4 || 25 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  God, this is my heart's desire: O treasure of
        kindness, O Merciful Lord, please make me the slave of your Saints.
        ||  Pause  ||   In the early hours of the morning, I fall at
        the feet of Your humble servants; night and day, I obtain the
        Blessed Vision of their Darshan. Dedicating my body and mind,
        I serve the humble servant of the Lord; with my tongue, I sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||   With each and every
        breath, I meditate in remembrance on my God; I live continually
        in the Society of the Saints. The Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is my only support and wealth; O Nanak, from this, I obtain bliss.

        the Fascinating Lord, who has blessed me with all comforts; He
        does not leave me to go anywhere else. I have seen the mortals
        of many and various types, but they are not equal to even a hair
        of my Beloved.  || 1 ||   His palace is so beautiful! His gate
        is so wonderful! The celestial melody of the sound current resounds
        there. Says Nanak, I enjoy eternal bliss; I have obtained a permanent

        I do not know the way, and I have no virtue. It is so difficult

        are among all, and yet distinct from all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        I do not seek power, and I do not seek liberation. My mind is
        in love with Your Lotus Feet. Brahma, Shiva, the Siddhas, the

        joy.  || 2 || 3 || 29 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating
        on the Lord, His servant swims across to salvation. When God becomes
        merciful to the meek, then one does not have to suffer reincarnation,
        only to die again.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, he sings the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord, and he does not lose the jewel of this human life. Singing
        the Glories of God, he crosses over the ocean of poison, and saves
        all his generations as well.  || 1 ||   The Lotus Feet of the
        Lord abide within his heart, and with every breath and morsel
        of food, he chants the Lord's Name. Nanak has grasped the

        How can I behold Him through clever tricks? Those who tell this
        story are wonder-struck and amazed.  || 1 ||   The servants of
        God, the celestial singers, the Siddhas and the seekers, the angelic
        and divine beings, Brahma and those like Brahma, and the four
        Vedas proclaim, day and night, that the Lord and Master is inaccessible,
        unapproachable and unfathomable. Endless, endless are His Glories,

        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru, of the most fruitful image,
