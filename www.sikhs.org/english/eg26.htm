      <p> O foolish mind, why do you cry and bewail? You shall obtain your
        pre-ordained destiny. God is the Giver of pain and pleasure. Abandon
        others, and think of Him alone. Whatever He does  -  take comfort
        in that. Why do you wander around, you ignorant fool? What things
        did you bring with you? You cling to worldly pleasures like a
        greedy moth. Dwell upon the Lord's Name in your heart. O
        Nanak, thus you shall return to your home with honor.  || 4 ||
        This merchandise, which you have come to obtain  -  the Lord's
        Name is obtained in the home of the Saints. Renounce your egotistical
        pride, and with your mind, purchase the Lord's Name  - 
        measure it out within your heart. Load up this merchandise, and
        set out with the Saints. Give up other corrupt entanglements.
  &quot;Blessed, blessed&quot;, everyone will call you, and your
        face shall be radiant in the Court of the Lord. In this trade,
        only a few are trading. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to them.
        || 5 ||   Wash the feet of the Holy, and drink in this water.
        Dedicate your soul to the Holy. Take your cleansing bath in the
        dust of the feet of the Holy. To the Holy, make your life a sacrifice.
        Service to the Holy is obtained by great good fortune. In the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praise is sung. From all sorts of dangers, the Saint saves us.
        Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, we taste the ambrosial
        essence. Seeking the Protection of the Saints, we have come to
        their door. All comforts, O Nanak, are so obtained.  || 6 || 
        He infuses life back into the dead. He gives food to the hungry.
        All treasures are within His Glance of Grace. People obtain that
        which they are pre-ordained to receive. All things are His; He
        is the Doer of all. Other than Him, there has never been any other,
        and there shall never be. Meditate on Him forever and ever, day
        and night. This way of life is exalted and immaculate. One whom
        the Lord, in His Grace, blesses with His Name  -  O Nanak,
        that person becomes immaculate and pure.  || 7 ||   One who has
        faith in the Guru in his mind comes to dwell upon the Lord God.
        He is acclaimed as a devotee, a humble devotee throughout the
        three worlds. The One Lord is in his heart. True are his actions;
        true are his ways. True is his heart; Truth is what he speaks
        with his mouth. True is his vision; true is his form. He distributes
        Truth and he spreads Truth. One who recognizes the Supreme Lord
        God as True  -  O Nanak, that humble being is absorbed into
        the True One.  || 8 || 15 ||   SHALOK:  He has no form, no shape,
        no color; God is beyond the three qualities. They alone understand
        Him, O Nanak, with whom He is pleased.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:
        Keep the Immortal Lord God enshrined within your mind. Renounce
        your love and attachment to people. Beyond Him, there is nothing
        at all. The One Lord is pervading among all. He Himself is All-seeing;
        He Himself is All-knowing, Unfathomable, Profound, Deep and All-knowing.
        He is the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, the Lord of
        the Universe, the Treasure of mercy, compassion and forgiveness. </p>

      </p>
      <p> To fall at the Feet of Your Holy Beings  -  this is the longing
        of Nanak's mind.  || 1 ||   He is the Fulfiller of wishes,
        who can give us Sanctuary; that which He has written, comes to
        pass. He destroys and creates in the twinkling of an eye. No one
        else knows the mystery of His ways. He is the embodiment of ecstasy
        and everlasting joy. I have heard that all things are in His home.
        Among kings, He is the King; among yogis, He is the Yogi. Among
        ascetics, He is the Ascetic; among householders, He is the Enjoyer.
        By constant meditation, His devotee finds peace. O Nanak, no one
        has found the limits of that Supreme Being.  || 2 ||   There is
        no limit to His play. All the demigods have grown weary of searching
        for it. What does the son know of his father's birth? All
        are strung upon His string. He bestows good sense, spiritual wisdom
        and meditation on His humble servants and slaves who meditate
        on the Naam. He leads some astray in the three qualities; they
        are born and die, coming and going over and over again. The high
        and the low are His places. As He inspires us to know Him, O Nanak,
        so is He known.  || 3 ||   Many are His forms; many are His colors.
        Many are the appearances which He assumes, and yet He is still
        the One. In so many ways, He has extended Himself. The Eternal
        Lord God is the One, the Creator. He performs His many plays in
        an instant. The Perfect Lord is pervading all places. In so many
        ways, He created the creation. He alone can estimate His worth.
        All hearts are His, and all places are His. Nanak lives by chanting,
        chanting the Name of the Lord.  || 4 ||   The Naam is the Support
        of all creatures. The Naam is the Support of the earth and solar
        systems. The Naam is the Support of the Simritees, the Vedas and
        the Puraanas. The Naam is the Support by which we hear of spiritual
        wisdom and meditation. The Naam is the Support of the Akaashic
        ethers and the nether regions. The Naam is the Support of all
        bodies. The Naam is the Support of all worlds and realms. Associating
        with the Naam, listening to it with the ears, one is saved. Those
        whom the Lord mercifully attaches to His Naam  -  O Nanak,
        in the fourth state, those humble servants attain salvation. 
        || 5 ||   His form is true, and true is His place. His personality
        is true  -  He alone is supreme. His acts are true, and true
        is His Word. The True Lord is permeating all. True are His actions;
        His creation is true. His root is true, and true is what originates
        from it. True is His lifestyle, the purest of the pure. All goes
        well for those who know Him. The True Name of God is the Giver
        of peace. Nanak has obtained true faith from the Guru.  || 6 ||
        True are the Teachings, and the Instructions of the Holy. True
        are those into whose hearts He enters. One who knows and loves
        the Truth  -  chanting the Naam, he obtains salvation. He Himself
        is True, and all that He has made is true. </p>

      <p> He Himself knows His own state and condition. He is the Creator
        Lord of His world. No one else understands Him, although they
        may try. The created cannot know the extent of the Creator. O
        Nanak, whatever pleases Him comes to pass.  || 7 ||   Gazing upon
        His wondrous wonder, I am wonder-struck and amazed! One who realizes
        this, comes to taste this state of joy. God's humble servants
        remain absorbed in His Love. Following the Guru's Teachings,
        they receive the four cardinal blessings. They are the givers,
        the dispellers of pain. In their company, the world is saved.
        The slave of the Lord's servant is so very blessed. In the
        company of His servant, one becomes attached to the Love of the
        One. His humble servant sings the Kirtan, the songs of the glory
        of God. By Guru's Grace, O Nanak, he receives the fruits
        of his rewards.  || 8 || 16 ||   SHALOK:  True in the beginning,
        True throughout the ages, True here and now. O Nanak, He shall
        forever be True.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  His Lotus Feet are True,
        and True are those who touch Them. His devotional worship is True,
        and True are those who worship Him. The Blessing of His Vision
        is True, and True are those who behold it. His Naam is True, and
        True are those who meditate on it. He Himself is True, and True
        is all that He sustains. He Himself is virtuous goodness, and
        He Himself is the Bestower of virtue. The Word of His Shabad is
        True, and True are those who speak of God. Those ears are True,
        and True are those who listen to His Praises. All is True to one
        who understands. O Nanak, True, True is He, the Lord God.  ||
        1 ||   One who believes in the Embodiment of Truth with all his
        heart recognizes the Cause of causes as the Root of all. One whose
        heart is filled with faith in God  -  the essence of spiritual
        wisdom is revealed to his mind. Coming out of fear, he comes to
        live without fear. He is absorbed into the One, from whom he originated.
        When something blends with its own, it cannot be said to be separate
        from it. This is understood only by one of discerning understanding.
        Meeting with the Lord, O Nanak, he becomes one with Him.  || 2
        ||   The servant is obedient to his Lord and Master. The servant
        worships his Lord and Master forever. The servant of the Lord
        Master has faith in his mind. The servant of the Lord Master lives
        a pure lifestyle. The servant of the Lord Master knows that the
        Lord is with him. God's servant is attuned to the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord. God is the Cherisher of His servant. The Formless
        Lord preserves His servant. Unto His servant, God bestows His
        Mercy. O Nanak, that servant remembers Him with each and every
        breath.  || 3 ||   He covers the faults of His servant. He surely
        preserves the honor of His servant. He blesses His slave with
        greatness. He inspires His servant to chant the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. He Himself preserves the honor of His servant. No
        one knows His state and extent. No one is equal to the servant
        of God. The servant of God is the highest of the high. One whom
        God applies to His own service, O Nanak  -  that servant is
        famous in the ten directions.  || 4 ||   He infuses His Power
        into the tiny ant; it can then reduce the armies of millions to
        ashes. Those whose breath of life He Himself does not take away
        -  He preserves them, and holds out His Hands to protect them. </p>

      <p> You may make all sorts of efforts, but these attempts are in vain.
        No one else can kill or preserve  -  He is the Protector of
        all beings. So why are you so anxious, O mortal? Meditate, O Nanak,
        on God, the invisible, the wonderful!  || 5 ||   Time after time,
        again and again, meditate on God. Drinking in this Nectar, this
        mind and body are satisfied. The jewel of the Naam is obtained
        by the Gurmukhs; they see no other than God. Unto them, the Naam
        is wealth, the Naam is beauty and delight. The Naam is peace,
        the Lord's Name is their companion. Those who are satisfied
        by the essence of the Naam  -  their minds and bodies are drenched
        with the Naam. While standing up, sitting down and sleeping, the
        Naam, says Nanak, is forever the occupation of God's humble
        servant.  || 6 ||   Chant His Praises with your tongue, day and
        night. God Himself has given this gift to His servants. Performing
        devotional worship with heart-felt love, they remain absorbed
        in God Himself. They know the past and the present. They recognize
        God's Own Command. Who can describe His Glory? I cannot describe
        even one of His virtuous qualities. Those who dwell in God's
        Presence, twenty-four hours a day  -  says Nanak, they are
        the perfect persons.  || 7 ||   O my mind, seek their protection;
        give your mind and body to those humble beings. Those humble beings
        who recognizes God are the givers of all things. In His Sanctuary,
        all comforts are obtained. By the Blessing of His Darshan, all
        sins are erased. So renounce all other clever devices, and enjoin
        yourself to the service of those servants. Your comings and goings
        shall be ended. O Nanak, worship the feet of God's humble
        servants forever.  || 8 || 17 ||   SHALOK:  The one who knows
        the True Lord God, is called the True Guru. In His Company, the
        Sikh is saved, O Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  The True Guru cherishes His Sikh. The
        Guru is always merciful to His servant. The Guru washes away the
        filth of the evil intellect of His Sikh. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, he chants the Lord's Name. The True Guru cuts
        away the bonds of His Sikh. The Sikh of the Guru abstains from
        evil deeds. The True Guru gives His Sikh the wealth of the Naam.
        The Sikh of the Guru is very fortunate. The True Guru arranges
        this world and the next for His Sikh. O Nanak, with the fullness
        of His heart, the True Guru mends His Sikh.  || 1 ||   That selfless
        servant, who lives in the Guru's household, is to obey the
        Guru's Commands with all his mind. He is not to call attention
        to himself in any way. He is to meditate constantly within his
        heart on the Name of the Lord. One who sells his mind to the True
        Guru  -  that humble servant's affairs are resolved. One
        who performs selfless service, without thought of reward, shall
        attain his Lord and Master. </p>

      <p> He Himself grants His Grace; O Nanak, that selfless servant lives
        the Guru's Teachings.  || 2 ||   One who obeys the Guru's
        Teachings one hundred per cent  -  that selfless servant comes
        to know the state of the Transcendent Lord. The True Guru's
        Heart is filled with the Name of the Lord. So many times, I am
        a sacrifice to the Guru. He is the treasure of everything, the
        Giver of life. Twenty-four hours a day, He is imbued with the
        Love of the Supreme Lord God. The servant is in God, and God is
        in the servant. He Himself is One  -  there is no doubt about
        this. By thousands of clever tricks, He is not found. O Nanak,
        such a Guru is obtained by the greatest good fortune.  || 3 ||
        Blessed is His Darshan; receiving it, one is purified. Touching
        His Feet, one's conduct and lifestyle become pure. Abiding
        in His Company, one chants the Lord's Praise, and reaches
        the Court of the Supreme Lord God. Listening to His Teachings,
        one's ears are satisfied. The mind is contented, and the
        soul is fulfilled. The Guru is perfect; His Teachings are everlasting.
        Beholding His Ambrosial Glance, one becomes saintly. Endless are
        His virtuous qualities; His worth cannot be appraised. O Nanak,
        one who pleases Him is united with Him.  || 4 ||   The tongue
        is one, but His Praises are many. The True Lord, of perfect perfection
        -  no speech can take the mortal to Him. God is Inaccessible,
        Incomprehensible, balanced in the state of Nirvaanaa. He is not
        sustained by food; He has no hatred or vengeance; He is the Giver
        of peace. No one can estimate His worth. Countless devotees continually
        bow in reverence to Him. In their hearts, they meditate on His
        Lotus Feet. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the True Guru; by
        His Grace, he meditates on God.  || 5 ||   Only a few obtain this
        ambrosial essence of the Lord's Name. Drinking in this Nectar,
        one becomes immortal. That person whose mind is illuminated by
        the treasure of excellence, never dies. Twenty-four hours a day,
        he takes the Name of the Lord. The Lord gives true instruction
        to His servant. He is not polluted by emotional attachment to
        Maya. In his mind, he cherishes the One Lord, Har, Har. In the
        pitch darkness, a lamp shines forth. O Nanak, doubt, emotional
        attachment and pain are erased.  || 6 ||   In the burning heat,
        a soothing coolness prevails. Happiness ensues and pain departs,
        O Siblings of Destiny. The fear of birth and death is dispelled,
        by the perfect Teachings of the Holy Saint. Fear is lifted, and
        one abides in fearlessness. All evils are dispelled from the mind.
        He takes us into His favor as His own. In the Company of the Holy,
        chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Stability is attained; doubt
        and wandering cease, O Nanak, listening with one's ears to
        the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 7 ||   He Himself is absolute
        and unrelated; He Himself is also involved and related. Manifesting
        His power, He fascinates the entire world. God Himself sets His
        play in motion. Only He Himself can estimate His worth. There
        is none, other than the Lord. Permeating all, He is the One. Through
        and through, He pervades in form and color. </p>

      <p> He is revealed in the Company of the Holy. Having created the
        creation, He infuses His own power into it. So many times, Nanak
        is a sacrifice to Him.  || 8 || 18 ||   SHALOK:  Nothing shall
        go along with you, except your devotion. All corruption is like
        ashes. Practice the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. O Nanak, this
        is the most excellent wealth.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  Joining
        the Company of the Saints, practice deep meditation. Remember
        the One, and take the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        Forget all other efforts, O my friend  -  enshrine the Lord's
        Lotus Feet within your heart. God is All-powerful; He is the Cause
        of causes. Grasp firmly the object of the Lord's Name. Gather
        this wealth, and become very fortunate. Pure are the instructions
        of the humble Saints. Keep faith in the One Lord within your mind.
        All disease, O Nanak, shall then be dispelled.  || 1 ||   The
        wealth which you chase after in the four directions  -  you
        shall obtain that wealth by serving the Lord. The peace, which
        you always yearn for, O friend  -  that peace comes by the
        love of the Company of the Holy. The glory, for which you perform
        good deeds  -  you shall obtain that glory by seeking the Lord's
        Sanctuary. All sorts of remedies have not cured the disease  - 
        the disease is cured only by giving the medicine of the Lord's
        Name. Of all treasures, the Lord's Name is the supreme treasure.
        Chant it, O Nanak, and be accepted in the Court of the Lord. 
        || 2 ||   Enlighten your mind with the Name of the Lord. Having
        wandered around in the ten directions, it comes to its place of
        rest. No obstacle stands in the way of one whose heart is filled
        with the Lord. The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is so hot; the Lord's
        Name is soothing and cool. Remember, remember it in meditation,
        and obtain everlasting peace. Your fear shall be dispelled, and
        your hopes shall be fulfilled. By devotional worship and loving
        adoration, your soul shall be enlightened. You shall go to that
        home, and live forever. Says Nanak, the noose of death is cut
        away.  || 3 ||   One who contemplates the essence of reality,
        is said to be the true person. Birth and death are the lot of
        the false and the insincere. Coming and going in reincarnation
        is ended by serving God. Give up your selfishness and conceit,
        and seek the Sanctuary of the Divine Guru. Thus the jewel of this
        human life is saved. Remember the Lord, Har, Har, the Support
        of the breath of life. By all sorts of efforts, people are not
        saved  -  not by studying the Simritees, the Shaastras or the
        Vedas. Worship the Lord with whole-hearted devotion. O Nanak,
        you shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desire.  || 4
        ||   Your wealth shall not go with you; why do you cling to it,
        you fool? Children, friends, family and spouse  -  who of these
        shall accompany you? Power, pleasure, and the vast expanse of
        Maya  -  who has ever escaped from these? Horses, elephants,
        chariots and pageantry  -  false shows and false displays.
        The fool does not acknowledge the One who gave this; forgetting
        the Naam, O Nanak, he will repent in the end.  || 5 ||   Take
        the Guru's advice, you ignorant fool; without devotion, even
        the clever have drowned. Worship the Lord with heart-felt devotion,
        my friend; your consciousness shall become pure. Enshrine the
        Lord's Lotus Feet in your mind; the sinful residues of countless
        lifetimes shall depart. </p>

      <p> Chant the Naam yourself, and inspire others to chant it as well.
        Hearing, speaking and living it, emancipation is obtained. The
        essential reality is the True Name of the Lord. With intuitive
        ease, O Nanak, sing His Glorious Praises.  || 6 ||   Chanting
        His Glories, your filth shall be washed off. The all-consuming
        poison of ego will be gone. You shall become carefree, and you
        shall dwell in peace. With every breath and every morsel of food,
        cherish the Lord's Name. Renounce all clever tricks, O mind.
        In the Company of the Holy, you shall obtain the true wealth.
        So gather the Lord's Name as your capital, and trade in it.
        In this world you shall be at peace, and in the Court of the Lord,
        you shall be acclaimed. See the One permeating all; says Nanak,
        your destiny is pre-ordained.  || 7 ||   Meditate on the One,
        and worship the One. Remember the One, and yearn for the One in
        your mind. Sing the endless Glorious Praises of the One. With
        mind and body, meditate on the One Lord God. The One Lord Himself
        is the One and Only. The Pervading Lord God is totally permeating
        all. The many expanses of the creation have all come from the
        One. Adoring the One, past sins are removed. Mind and body within
        are imbued with the One God. By Guru's Grace, O Nanak, the
        One is known.  || 8 || 19 ||   SHALOK:  After wandering and wandering,
        O God, I have come, and entered Your Sanctuary. This is Nanak's
        prayer, O God: please, attach me to Your devotional service. 
        || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  I am a beggar; I beg for this gift from
        You: please, by Your Mercy, Lord, give me Your Name. I ask for
        the dust of the feet of the Holy. O Supreme Lord God, please fulfill
        my yearning; may I sing the Glorious Praises of God forever and
        ever. With each and every breath, may I meditate on You, O God.
        May I enshrine affection for Your Lotus Feet. May I perform devotional
        worship to God each and every day. You are my only Shelter, my
        only Support. Nanak asks for the most sublime, the Naam, the Name
        of God.  || 1 ||   By God's Gracious Glance, there is great
        peace. Rare are those who obtain the juice of the Lord's
        essence. Those who taste it are satisfied. They are fulfilled
        and realized beings  -  they do not waver. They are totally
        filled to over-flowing with the sweet delight of His Love. Spiritual
        delight wells up within, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy. Taking to His Sanctuary, they forsake all others. Deep within,
        they are enlightened, and they center themselves on Him, day and
        night. Most fortunate are those who meditate on God. O Nanak,
        attuned to the Naam, they are at peace.  || 2 ||   The wishes
        of the Lord's servant are fulfilled. From the True Guru,
        the pure teachings are obtained. Unto His humble servant, God
        has shown His kindness. He has made His servant eternally happy.
        The bonds of His humble servant are cut away, and he is liberated.
        The pains of birth and death, and doubt are gone. Desires are
        satisfied, and faith is fully rewarded, imbued forever with His
        all-pervading peace. He is His  -  he merges in Union with
        Him. Nanak is absorbed in devotional worship of the Naam.  ||
        3 ||   Why forget Him, who does not overlook our efforts? </p>

      <p> Why forget Him, who acknowledges what we do? Why forget Him, who
        has given us everything? Why forget Him, who is the Life of the
        living beings? Why forget Him, who preserves us in the fire of
        the womb? By Guru's Grace, rare is the one who realizes this.
        Why forget Him, who lifts us up out of corruption? Those separated
        from Him for countless lifetimes, are re-united with Him once
        again. Through the Perfect Guru, this essential reality is understood.
        O Nanak, God's humble servants meditate on Him.  || 4 ||
        O friends, O Saints, make this your work. Renounce everything
        else, and chant the Name of the Lord. Meditate, meditate, meditate
        in remembrance of Him, and find peace. Chant the Naam yourself,
        and inspire others to chant it. By loving devotional worship,
        you shall cross over the world-ocean. Without devotional meditation,
        the body will be just ashes. All joys and comforts are in the
        treasure of the Naam. Even the drowning can reach the place of
        rest and safety. All sorrows shall vanish. O Nanak, chant the
        Naam, the treasure of excellence.  || 5 ||   Love and affection,
        and the taste of yearning, have welled up within; within my mind
        and body, this is my purpose: beholding with my eyes His Blessed
        Vision, I am at peace. My mind blossoms forth in ecstasy, washing
        the feet of the Holy. The minds and bodies of His devotees are
        infused with His Love. Rare is the one who obtains their company.
        Show Your mercy  -  please, grant me this one request: by Guru's
        Grace, may I chant the Naam. His Praises cannot be spoken; O Nanak,
        He is contained among all.  || 6 ||   God, the Forgiving Lord,
        is kind to the poor. He loves His devotees, and He is always merciful
        to them. The Patron of the patronless, the Lord of the Universe,
        the Sustainer of the world, the Nourisher of all beings. The Primal
        Being, the Creator of the Creation. The Support of the breath
        of life of His devotees. Whoever meditates on Him is sanctified,
        focusing the mind in loving devotional worship. I am unworthy,
        lowly and ignorant. Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, O Supreme
        Lord God.  || 7 ||   Everything is obtained: the heavens, liberation
        and deliverance, if one sings the Lord's Glories, even for
        an instant. So many realms of power, pleasures and great glories,
        come to one whose mind is pleased with the Sermon of the Lord's
        Name. Abundant foods, clothes and music come to one whose tongue
        continually chants the Lord's Name, Har, Har. His actions
        are good, he is glorious and wealthy; the Mantra of the Perfect
        Guru dwells within his heart. O God, grant me a home in the Company
        of the Holy. All pleasures, O Nanak, are so revealed.  || 8 ||
        20 ||   SHALOK:  He possesses all qualities; He transcends all
        qualities; He is the Formless Lord. He Himself is in Primal Samaadhi.
        Through His Creation, O Nanak, He meditates on Himself.  || 1
        ||   ASHTAPADEE:  When this world had not yet appeared in any
        form, who then committed sins and performed good deeds? When the
        Lord Himself was in Profound Samaadhi, then against whom were
        hate and jealousy directed? When there was no color or shape to
        be seen, then who experienced joy and sorrow? When the Supreme
        Lord Himself was Himself All-in-all, then where was emotional
        attachment, and who had doubts? </p>

      <p> He Himself has staged His own drama; O Nanak, there is no other
        Creator.  || 1 ||   When there was only God the Master, then who
        was called bound or liberated? When there was only the Lord, Unfathomable
        and Infinite, then who entered hell, and who entered heaven? When
        God was without attributes, in absolute poise, then where was
        mind and where was matter  -  where was Shiva and Shakti? When
        He held His Own Light unto Himself, then who was fearless, and
        who was afraid? He Himself is the Performer in His own plays;
        O Nanak, the Lord Master is Unfathomable and Infinite.  || 2 ||
        When the Immortal Lord was seated at ease, then where was birth,
        death and dissolution? When there was only God, the Perfect Creator,
        then who was afraid of death? When there was only the One Lord,
        unmanifest and incomprehensible, then who was called to account
        by the recording scribes of the conscious and the subconscious?
        When there was only the Immaculate, Incomprehensible, Unfathomable
        Master, then who was emancipated, and who was held in bondage?
        He Himself, in and of Himself, is the most wonderful. O Nanak,
        He Himself created His Own Form.  || 3 ||   When there was only
        the Immaculate Being, the Lord of beings, there was no filth,
        so what was there to be washed clean? When there was only the
        Pure, Formless Lord in Nirvaanaa, then who was honored, and who
        was dishonored? When there was only the Form of the Lord of the
        Universe, then who was tainted by fraud and sin? When the Embodiment
        of Light was immersed in His Own Light, then who was hungry, and
        who was satisfied? He is the Cause of causes, the Creator Lord.
        O Nanak, the Creator is beyond calculation.  || 4 ||   When His
        Glory was contained within Himself, then who was mother, father,
        friend, child or sibling? When all power and wisdom was latent
        within Him, then where were the Vedas and the scriptures, and
        who was there to read them? When He kept Himself, All-in-all,
        unto His Own Heart, then who considered omens to be good or bad?
        When He Himself was lofty, and He Himself was near at hand, then
        who was called master, and who was called disciple? We are wonder-struck
        at the wondrous wonder of the Lord. O Nanak, He alone knows His
        own state.  || 5 ||   When the Undeceiveable, Impenetrable, Inscrutable
        One was self-absorbed, then who was swayed by Maya? When He paid
        homage to Himself, then the three qualities were not prevailing.
        When there was only the One, the One and Only Lord God, then who
        was not anxious, and who felt anxiety? When He Himself was satisfied
        with Himself, then who spoke and who listened? He is vast and
        infinite, the highest of the high. O Nanak, He alone can reach
        Himself.  || 6 ||   When He Himself fashioned the visible world
        of the creation, he made the world subject to the three dispositions. </p>

      <p> Sin and virtue then began to be spoken of. Some have gone to hell,
        and some yearn for paradise. Worldly snares and entanglements
        of Maya, egotism, attachment, doubt and loads of fear; pain and
        pleasure, honor and dishonor  -  these came to be described
        in various ways. He Himself creates and beholds His own drama.
        He winds up the drama, and then, O Nanak, He alone remains.  ||
        7 ||   Wherever the Eternal Lord's devotee is, He Himself
        is there. He unfolds the expanse of His creation for the glory
        of His Saint. He Himself is the Master of both worlds. His Praise
        is to Himself alone. He Himself performs and plays His amusements
        and games. He Himself enjoys pleasures, and yet He is unaffected
        and untouched. He attaches whomever He pleases to His Name. He
        causes whomever He pleases to play in His play. He is beyond calculation,
        beyond measure, uncountable and unfathomable. As You inspire him
        to speak, O Lord, so does servant Nanak speak.  || 8 || 21 ||
        SHALOK:  O Lord and Master of all beings and creatures, You
        Yourself are prevailing everywhere. O Nanak, The One is All-pervading;
        where is any other to be seen?  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  He Himself
        is the speaker, and He Himself is the listener. He Himself is
        the One, and He Himself is the many. When it pleases Him, He creates
        the world. As He pleases, He absorbs it back into Himself. Without
        You, nothing can be done. Upon Your thread, You have strung the
        whole world. One whom God Himself inspires to understand  - 
        that person obtains the True Name. He looks impartially upon all,
        and he knows the essential reality. O Nanak, he conquers the whole
        world.  || 1 ||   All beings and creatures are in His Hands. He
        is Merciful to the meek, the Patron of the patronless. No one
        can kill those who are protected by Him. One who is forgotten
        by God, is already dead. Leaving Him, where else could anyone
        go? Over the heads of all is the One, the Immaculate King. The
        ways and means of all beings are in His Hands. Inwardly and outwardly,
        know that He is with you. He is the Ocean of excellence, infinite
        and endless. Slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him.  || 2
        ||   The Perfect, Merciful Lord is pervading everywhere. His kindness
        extends to all. He Himself knows His own ways. The Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts, is present everywhere. He cherishes His
        living beings in so many ways. That which He has created meditates
        on Him. Whoever pleases Him, He blends into Himself. They perform
        His devotional service and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        With heart-felt faith, they believe in Him. O Nanak, they realize
        the One, the Creator Lord.  || 3 ||   The Lord's humble servant
        is committed to His Name. His hopes do not go in vain. The servant's
        purpose is to serve; obeying the Lord's Command, the supreme
        status is obtained. Beyond this, he has no other thought. Within
        his mind, the Formless Lord abides. His bonds are cut away, and
        he becomes free of hatred. Night and day, he worships the Feet
        of the Guru. He is at peace in this world, and happy in the next. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, the Lord God unites him with Himself.  || 4 ||   Join
        the Company of the Holy, and be happy. Sing the Glories of God,
        the embodiment of supreme bliss. Contemplate the essence of the
        Lord's Name. Redeem this human body, so difficult to obtain.
        Sing the Ambrosial Words of the Lord's Glorious Praises;
        this is the way to save your mortal soul. Behold God near at hand,
        twenty-four hours a day. Ignorance shall depart, and darkness
        shall be dispelled. Listen to the Teachings, and enshrine them
        in your heart. O Nanak, you shall obtain the fruits of your mind's
        desires.  || 5 ||   Embellish both this world and the next; enshrine
        the Lord's Name deep within your heart. Perfect are the Teachings
        of the Perfect Guru. That person, within whose mind it abides,
        realizes the Truth. With your mind and body, chant the Naam; lovingly
        attune yourself to it. Sorrow, pain and fear shall depart from
        your mind. Deal in the true trade, O trader, and your merchandise
        shall be safe in the Court of the Lord. Keep the Support of the
        One in your mind. O Nanak, you shall not have to come and go in
        reincarnation again.  || 6 ||   Where can anyone go, to get away
        from Him? Meditating on the Protector Lord, you shall be saved.
        Meditating on the Fearless Lord, all fear departs. By God's
        Grace, mortals are released. One who is protected by God never
        suffers in pain. Chanting the Naam, the mind becomes peaceful.
        Anxiety departs, and ego is eliminated. No one can equal that
        humble servant. The Brave and Powerful Guru stands over his head.
        O Nanak, his efforts are fulfilled.  || 7 ||   His wisdom is perfect,
        and His Glance is Ambrosial. Beholding His Vision, the universe
        is saved. His Lotus Feet are incomparably beautiful. The Blessed
        Vision of His Darshan is fruitful and rewarding; His Lordly Form
        is beautiful. Blessed is His service; His servant is famous. The
        Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is the most exalted Supreme
        Being. That one, within whose mind He abides, is blissfully happy.
        Death does not draw near him. One becomes immortal, and obtains
        the immortal status, meditating on the Lord, O Nanak, in the Company
        of the Holy.  || 8 || 22 ||   SHALOK:  The Guru has given the
        healing ointment of spiritual wisdom, and dispelled the darkness
        of ignorance. By the Lord's Grace, I have met the Saint;
        O Nanak, my mind is enlightened.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  In the
        Society of the Saints, I see God deep within my being. God's
        Name is sweet to me. All things are contained in the Heart of
        the One, although they appear in so many various colors. The nine
        treasures are in the Ambrosial Name of God. Within the human body
        is its place of rest. The Deepest Samaadhi, and the unstruck sound
        current of the Naad are there. The wonder and marvel of it cannot
        be described. He alone sees it, unto whom God Himself reveals
        it. O Nanak, that humble being understands.  || 1 ||   The Infinite
        Lord is inside, and outside as well. Deep within each and every
        heart, the Lord God is pervading. In the earth, in the Akaashic
        ethers, and in the nether regions of the underworld  -  in
        all worlds, He is the Perfect Cherisher. <br>
