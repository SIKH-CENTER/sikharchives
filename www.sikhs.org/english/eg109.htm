      <p> <font color="#000000">Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        so many silent sages have been saved; Indra and Brahma have also
        been saved. Sanak, Sanandan and many humble men of austerity,
        by Guru's Grace, have been carried across to the other
        side.  || 1 ||   Without the Word of the Shabad, how can anyone
        cross over the terrifying world-ocean? Without the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, the world is entangled in the disease of duality,
        and is drowned, drowned, and dies.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru
        is Divine; the Guru is Inscrutable and Mysterious. Serving the
        Guru, the three worlds are known and understood. The Guru, the
        Giver, has Himself given me the Gift; I have obtained the Inscrutable,
        Mysterious Lord.  || 2 ||   The mind is the king; the mind is
        appeased and satisfied through the mind itself, and desire is
        stilled in the mind. The mind is the Yogi, the mind wastes away
        in separation from the Lord; singing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord, the mind is instructed and reformed.  || 3 ||   How very
        rare are those in this world who, through the Guru, subdue their
        minds, and contemplate the Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, our Lord
        and Master is All-pervading; through the True Word of the Shabad,
        we are emancipated.  || 4 || 1 || 2 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIRST MEHL:
        The eyes lose their sight, and the body withers away; old age
        overtakes the mortal, and death hangs over his head. Beauty, loving
        attachment and the pleasures of life are not permanent. How can
        anyone escape from the noose of death?  || 1 ||   O mortal, meditate
        on the Lord - your life is passing away! <br>
      </font> </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Without the True Word of the Shabad, you shall never be released,
        and your life shall be totally useless.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        Within the body are sexual desire, anger, egotism and attachment.
        This pain is so great, and so difficult to endure. As Gurmukh,
        chant the Lord's Name, and savor it with your tongue; in
        this way, you shall cross over to the other side.  || 2 ||   Your
        ears are deaf, and your intellect is worthless, and still, you
        do not intuitively understand the Word of the Shabad. The self-willed
        manmukh wastes this priceless human life and loses it. Without
        the Guru, the blind person cannot see.  || 3 ||   Whoever remains
        detached and free of desire in the midst of desire - and
        whoever, unattached, intuitively meditates on the Celestial Lord
        - prays Nanak, as Gurmukh, he is released. He is lovingly
        attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 ||  || 2 || 3
        ||   BHAIRAO,  FIRST MEHL:  His walk becomes weak and clumsy,
        his feet and hands shake, and the skin of his body is withered
        and wrinkled. His eyes are dim, his ears are deaf, and yet, the
        self-willed manmukh does not know the Naam.  || 1 ||   O blind
        man, what have you obtained by coming into the world? The Lord
        is not in your heart, and you do not serve the Guru. After wasting
        your capital, you shall have to depart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        Your tongue is not imbued with the Love of the Lord; whatever
        you say is tasteless and insipid. You indulge in slander of the
        Saints; becoming a beast, you shall never be noble.  || 2 || 
        Only a few obtain the sublime essence of the Ambrosial Amrit,
        united in Union with the True Guru. As long as the mortal does
        not come to understand the mystery of the Shabad, the Word of
        God, he shall continue to be tormented by death.  || 3 ||   Whoever
        finds the door of the One True Lord, does not know any other house
        or door. By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status;
        so says poor Nanak.  || 4 || 3 || 4 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIRST MEHL:
        He spends the entire night in sleep; the noose is tied around
        his neck. His day is wasted in worldly entanglements. He does
        not know God, who created this world, for a moment, for even an
        instant.  || 1 ||   O mortal, how will you escape this terrible
        disaster? What did you bring with you, and what will you take
        away? Meditate on the Lord, the Most Worthy and Generous Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The heart-lotus of the self-willed manmukh
        is upside-down; his intellect is shallow; his mind is blind, and
        his head is entangled in worldly affairs. Death and re-birth constantly
        hang over your head; without the Name, your neck shall be caught
        in the noose.  || 2 ||   Your steps are unsteady, and your eyes
        are blind; you are not aware of the Word of the Shabad, O Sibling
        of Destiny. The Shaastras and the Vedas keep the mortal bound
        to the three modes of Maya, and so he performs his deeds blindly.
        || 3 ||   He loses his capital - how can he earn any profit?
        The evil-minded person has no spiritual wisdom at all. Contemplating
        the Shabad, he drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord; O Nanak,
        his faith is confirmed in the Truth.  || 4 || 4 || 5 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIRST MEHL:  He remains with the Guru, day and night, and his
        tongue savors the savory taste of the Lord's Love. He does
        not know any other; he realizes the Word of the Shabad. He knows
        and realizes the Lord deep within his own being.  || 1 ||   Such
        a humble person is pleasing to my mind. He conquers his self-conceit,
        and is imbued with the Infinite Lord. He serves the Guru.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Deep within my being, and outside as well, is
        the Immaculate Lord God. I bow humbly before that Primal Lord
        God.<br>

      </p>
      <p> Deep within each and every heart, and amidst all, the Embodiment
        of Truth is permeating and pervading.  || 2 ||   Those who are
        imbued with Truth - their tongues are tinged with Truth;
        they do not have even an iota of the filth of falsehood. They
        taste the sweet Ambrosial Nectar of the Immaculate Naam, the Name
        of the Lord; imbued with the Shabad, they are blessed with honor.
        || 3 ||   The virtuous meet with the virtuous, and earn the profit;
        as Gurmukh, they obtain the glorious greatness of the Naam. All
        sorrows are erased, by serving the Guru; O Nanak, the Naam is
        our only Friend and Companion.  || 4 || 5 || 6 ||   BHAIRAO, 
        FIRST MEHL:  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the wealth and
        support of all; It is enshrined in the heart, by Guru's
        Grace. One who gathers this imperishable wealth is fulfilled,
        and through intuitive meditation, is lovingly focused on the Lord.
        || 1 ||   O mortal, focus your consciousness on devotional worship
        of the Lord. As Gurmukh, meditate on the Name of the Lord in your
        heart, and you shall return to your home with intuitive ease.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Doubt, separation and fear are never eradicated,
        and the mortal continues coming and going in reincarnation, as
        long as he does not know the Lord. Without the Name of the Lord,
        no one is liberated; they drown and die without water.  || 2 ||
        Busy with his worldly affairs, all honor is lost; the ignorant
        one is not rid of his doubts. Without the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, the mortal is never liberated; he remains blindly entangled
        in the expanse of worldly affairs.  || 3 ||   My mind is pleased
        and appeased with the Immaculate Lord, who has no ancestry. Through
        the mind itself, the mind is subdued. Deep within my being, and
        outside as well, I know only the One Lord. O Nanak, there is no
        other at all.  || 4 || 6 || 7 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIRST MEHL:  You
        may give feasts, make burnt offerings, donate to charity, perform
        austere penance and worship, and endure pain and suffering in
        the body. But without the Lord's Name, liberation is not
        obtained. As Gurmukh, obtain the Naam and liberation.  || 1 ||
        Without the Lord's Name, birth into the world is useless.
        Without the Name, the mortal eats poison and speaks poisonous
        words; he dies fruitlessly, and wanders in reincarnation.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The mortal may read scriptures, study grammar
        and say his prayers three times a day. Without the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, where is liberation, O mortal? Without the
        Lord's Name, the mortal is entangled and dies.  || 2 ||
        Walking sticks, begging bowls, hair tufts, sacred threads, loin
        cloths, pilgrimages to sacred shrines and wandering all around
        - without the Lord's Name, peace and tranquility
        are not obtained. One who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        crosses over to the other side.  || 3 ||   The mortal's
        hair may be matted and tangled upon his head, and he may smear
        his body with ashes; he may take off his clothes and go naked.
        But without the Lord's Name, he is not satisfied; he wears
        religious robes, but he is bound by the karma of the actions he
        committed in past lives.  || 4 ||   As many beings and creatures
        as there are in the water, on the land and in the sky -
        wherever they are, You are with them all, O Lord. By Guru's
        Grace, please preserve Your humble servant; O Lord, Nanak stirs
        up this juice, and drinks it in.  || 5 || 7 || 8 || </p>

      <p> So much sin and corruption comes from this pride.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Everyone says that there are four castes, four social classes.
        They all emanate from the drop of God's Seed.  || 2 ||
        The entire universe is made of the same clay. The Potter has
        shaped it into all sorts of vessels.  || 3 ||   The five elements
        join together, to make up the form of the human body. Who can
        say which is less, and which is more?  || 4 ||   Says Nanak, this
        soul is bound by its actions. Without meeting the True Guru, it
        is not liberated.  || 5 || 1 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  The Yogis,
        the householders, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the
        beggars in religious robes - they are all asleep in egotism.
        || 1 ||   They are asleep, intoxicated with the wine of Maya
        Only those who remain awake and aware are not robbed.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   One who has met the True Guru, remains awake and
        aware. Such a person overpowers the five thieves.  || 2 ||   One
        who contemplates the essence of reality remains awake and aware.
        He kills his self-conceit, and does not kill anyone else.  ||
        3 ||   One who knows the One Lord remains awake and aware. He
        abandons the service of others, and realizes the essence of reality.
        || 4 ||   Of the four castes, whoever remains awake and aware
        is released from birth and death.  || 5 ||   Says Nanak, that
        humble being remains awake and aware, who applies the ointment
        of spiritual wisdom to his eyes.  || 6 || 2 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Whoever the Lord keeps in His Sanctuary, is attached to
        the Truth, and receives the fruit of Truth.  || 1 ||   O mortal,
        unto whom will you complain? The Hukam of the Lord's Command
        is pervasive; by the Hukam of His Command, all things happen.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This Creation was established by You. In
        an instant You destroy it, and You create it again without a moment's
        delay.  || 2 ||   By His Grace, He has staged this Play. By the
        Guru's Merciful Grace, I have obtained the supreme status.
        || 3 ||   Says Nanak, He alone kills and revives. Understand
        this well - do not be confused by doubt.  || 4 || 3 ||
        BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  I am the bride; the Creator is my Husband
        Lord. As He inspires me, I adorn myself.  || 1 ||   When it pleases
        Him, He enjoys me. I am joined, body and mind, to my True Lord
        and Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   How can anyone praise or slander
        anyone else? The One Lord Himself is pervading and permeating
        all.  || 2 ||   By Guru's Grace, I am attracted by His
        Love. I shall meet with my Merciful Lord, and vibrate the Panch
        Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds.  || 3 ||   Prays Nanak, what can
        anyone do? He alone meets with the Lord, whom the Lord Himself
        meets.  || 4 || 4 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  He alone is a silent
        sage, who subdues his mind's duality. Subduing his duality,
        he contemplates God.  || 1 ||   Let each person examine his own
        mind, O Siblings of Destiny. Examine your mind, and you shall
        obtain the nine treasures of the Naam.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        Creator created the world, upon the foundation of worldly love
        and attachment. Attaching it to possessiveness, He has led it
        into confusion with doubt.  || 2 ||   From this Mind come all
        bodies, and the breath of life. By mental contemplation, the mortal
        realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, and merges in
        Him.  || 3 || <br>

      <p> When the mortal has good karma, the Guru grants His Grace. Then
        this mind is awakened, and the duality of this mind is subdued.
        || 4 ||   It is the innate nature of the mind to remain forever
        detached. The Detached, Dispassionate Lord dwells within all.
        || 5 ||   Says Nanak, one who understands this mystery, becomes
        the embodiment of the Primal, Immaculate, Divine Lord God.  ||
        6 || 5 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  The world is saved through
        Name of the Lord. It carries the mortal across the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 1 ||   By Guru's Grace, dwell upon the
        Lord's Name. It shall stand by you forever.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The foolish self-willed manmukhs do not remember the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Without the Name, how will they cross over?
        || 2 ||   The Lord, the Great Giver, Himself gives His Gifts.
        Celebrate and praise the Great Giver!  || 3 ||   Granting His
        Grace, the Lord unites the mortals with the True Guru. O Nanak,
        the Naam is enshrined within the heart.  || 4 || 6 ||   BHAIRAO,
        THIRD MEHL:  All people are saved through the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. Those who become Gurmukh are blessed to receive It.
        || 1 ||   When the Dear Lord showers His Mercy, He blesses the
        Gurmukh with the glorious greatness of the Naam.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Those who love the Beloved Name of the Lord save themselves,
        and save all their ancestors.  || 2 ||   Without the Name, the
        self-willed manmukhs go to the City of Death. They suffer in pain
        and endure beatings.  || 3 ||   When the Creator Himself gives,
        O Nanak, then the mortals receive the Naam.  || 4 || 7 ||   BHAIRAO,
        THIRD MEHL:  Love of the Lord of the Universe saved Sanak and
        his brother, the sons of Brahma. They contemplated the Word of
        the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord,
        please shower me with Your Mercy, that as Gurmukh, I may embrace
        love for Your Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whoever has true loving
        devotional worship deep within his being meets the Lord, through
        the Perfect Guru.  || 2 ||   He naturally, intuitively dwells
        within the home of his own inner being. The Naam abides within
        the mind of the Gurmukh.  || 3 ||   The Lord, the Seer, Himself
        sees. O Nanak, enshrine the Naam within your heart.  || 4 || 8
        ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, enshrine
        the Lord's Name within your heart. Without the Name, ashes
        will be blown in your face.  || 1 ||   The Lord's Name
        is so difficult to obtain, O Siblings of Destiny. By Guru's
        Grace, it comes to dwell in the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That
        humble being who seeks the Lord's Name, receives it from
        the Perfect Guru.  || 2 ||   Those humble beings who accept the
        Will of the Lord, are approved and accepted. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, they bear the insignia of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||   So serve the One, whose power
        supports the Universe. O Nanak, the Gurmukh loves the Naam.  ||
        4 || 9 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,
        many rituals are performed. But it is not the time for them, and
        so they are of no use.  || 1 ||   In Kali Yuga, the Lord's
        Name is the most sublime. As Gurmukh, be lovingly attached to
        Truth.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Searching my body and mind, I found
        Him within the home of my own heart. The Gurmukh centers his consciousness
        on the Lord's Name.<br>

        || 3 ||   In Kali Yuga, it is the time for the One Dear Lord;
        it is not the time for anything else. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, let

      <p> <font color="#000000">The self-willed manmukhs are afflicted with
        the disease of duality; they are burnt by the intense fire of
        desire. They die and die again, and are reborn; they find no place
        of rest. They waste their lives uselessly.  || 1 ||   O my Beloved,
        grant Your Grace, and give me understanding. The world was created
        in the disease of egotism; without the Word of the Shabad, the
        disease is not cured.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There are so many
        silent sages, who read the Simritees and the Shaastras; without
        the Shabad, they have no clear awareness. All those under the
        influence of the three qualities are afflicted with the disease;
        through possessiveness, they lose their awareness.  || 2 ||  
        O God, you save some, and you enjoin others to serve the Guru.
        They obtain the treasure of the Name of the Lord; peace comes
        to abide within their minds.  || 3 ||   The Gurmukhs dwell in
        the fourth state; they obtain a dwelling in the home of their
        own inner being. The Perfect True Guru shows His Mercy to them;
        they eradicate their self-conceit from within.  || 4 ||   Everyone
        must serve the One Lord, who created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
        O Nanak, the One True Lord is permanent and stable. He does not
        die, and He is not born.  || 5 || 1 || 11 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD
        MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh is afflicted with the disease of
        duality forever; the entire universe is diseased. The Gurmukh
        understands, and is cured of the disease, contemplating the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, please let
        me join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. O Nanak, the Lord
        blesses with glorious greatness, those who focus their consciousness
        on the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Death takes all
        those who are afflicted with the disease of possessiveness. They
        are subject to the Messenger of Death. The Messenger of Death
        does not even approach that mortal who, as Gurmukh, enshrines
        the Lord within his heart.  || 2 ||   One who does not know the
        Lord's Name, and who does not become Gurmukh - why
        did he even come into the world? He never serves the Guru; he
        wastes his life uselessly.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, those whom the
        True Guru enjoins to His service, have perfect good fortune. They
        obtain the fruits of their desires, and find peace in the Word
        of the Guru's Bani.  || 4 || 2 || 12 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD
        MEHL:  In pain he is born, in pain he dies, and in pain he does
        his deeds. He is never released from the womb of reincarnation;
        he rots away in manure.  || 1 ||   Cursed, cursed is the self-willed
        manmukh, who wastes his life away. He does not serve the Perfect
        Guru; he does not love the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   The Word of the Guru's Shabad cures all diseases;
        he alone is attached to it, whom the Dear Lord attaches. <br>

      <p> Through the Naam, glorious greatness is obtained; he alone obtains
        it, whose mind is filled with the Lord.  || 2 ||   Meeting the
        True Guru, the fruitful rewards are obtained. This true lifestyle
        beings sublime peace. Those humble beings who are attached to
        the Lord are immaculate; they enshrine love for the Lord's
        Name.  || 3 ||   If I obtain the dust of their feet, I apply it
        to my forehead. They meditate on the Perfect True Guru. O Nanak,
        this dust is obtained only by perfect destiny. They focus their
        consciousness on the Lord's Name.  || 4 || 3 || 13 || 
        BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  That humble being who contemplates the
        Word of the Shabad is true; the True Lord is within his heart.
        If someone performs true devotional worship day and night, then
        his body will not feel pain.  || 1 ||   Everyone calls him, &quot;Devotee,
        devotee.&quot; But without serving the True Guru, devotional
        worship is not obtained. Only through perfect destiny does one
        meet God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukhs lose
        their capital, and still, they demand profits. How can they earn
        any profit? The Messenger of Death is always hovering above their
        heads. In the love of duality, they lose their honor.  || 2 ||
        Trying on all sorts of religious robes, they wander around day
        and night, but the disease of their egotism is not cured. Reading
        and studying, they argue and debate; attached to Maya, they lose
        their awareness.  || 3 ||   Those who serve the True Guru are
        blessed with the supreme status; through the Naam, they are blessed
        with glorious greatness. O Nanak, those whose minds are filled
        with the Naam, are honored in the Court of the True Lord.  ||
        4 || 4 || 14 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh
        cannot escape false hope. In the love of duality, he is ruined.
        His belly is like a river - it is never filled up. He is
        consumed by the fire of desire.  || 1 ||   Eternally blissful
        are those who are imbued with the sublime essence of the Lord.
        The Naam, the Name of the Lord, fills their hearts, and duality
        runs away from their minds. Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar of
        the Lord, Har, Har, they are satisfied.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        The Supreme Lord God Himself created the Universe; He links each
        and every person to their tasks. He Himself created love and attachment
        to Maya; He Himself attaches the mortals to duality.  || 2 ||
        If there were any other, then I would speak to him; all will
        be merged in You. The Gurmukh contemplates the essence of spiritual
        wisdom; his light merges into the Light.  || 3 ||   God is True,
        Forever True, and all His Creation is True. O Nanak, the True
        Guru has given me this understanding; the True Name brings emancipation.
        || 4 || 5 || 15 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  In this Dark Age
        of Kali Yuga, those who do not realize the Lord are goblins. In
        the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, the supreme soul-swans contemplated
        the Lord. In the Silver Age of Dwaapur Yuga, and the Brass Age
        of Traytaa Yuga, mankind prevailed, but only a rare few subdued
        their egos.  || 1 ||   In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, glorious
        greatness is obtained through the Lord's Name. In each
        and every age, the Gurmukhs know the One Lord; without the Name,
        liberation is not attained.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, is revealed in the heart of the True Lord's
        humble servant. It dwells in the mind of the Gurmukh. Those who
        are lovingly focused on the Lord's Name save themselves;
        they save all their ancestors as well.  || 2 ||   My Lord God
        is the Giver of virtue. <br>

      <p> The Word of the Shabad burns away all faults and demerits. Those
        whose minds are filled with the Naam are beautiful; they enshrine
        the Naam within their hearts.  || 3 ||   The True Guru has revealed
        to me the Lord's Home and His Court, and the Mansion of
        His Presence. I joyfully enjoy His Love. Whatever He says, I accept
        as good; Nanak chants the Naam.  || 4 || 6 || 16 ||   BHAIRAO,
        THIRD MEHL:  The desires of the mind are absorbed in the mind,
        contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Understanding
        is obtained from the Perfect Guru, and then the mortal does not
        die over and over again.  || 1 ||   My mind takes the Support
        of the Lord's Name. By Guru's Grace, I have obtained
        the supreme status; the Lord is the Fulfiller of all desires.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One Lord is permeating and pervading
        amongst all; without the Guru, this understanding is not obtained.
        My Lord God has been revealed to me, and I have become Gurmukh.
        Night and day, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 2
        ||   The One Lord is the Giver of peace; peace is not found anywhere
        else. Those who do not serve the Giver, the True Guru, depart
        regretfully in the end.  || 3 ||   Serving the True Guru, lasting
        peace is obtained, and the mortal does not suffer in pain any
        longer. Nanak has been blessed with devotional worship of the
        Lord; his light has merged into the Light.  || 4 || 7 || 17 ||
        BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  Without the Guru, the world is insane;
        confused and deluded, it is beaten, and it suffers. It dies and
        dies again, and is reborn, always in pain, but it is unaware of
        the Lord's Gate.  || 1 ||   O my mind, remain always in
        the Protection of the True Guru's Sanctuary. Those people,
        to whose hearts the Lord's Name seems sweet, are carried
        across the terrifying world-ocean by the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The mortal wears various religious
        robes, but his consciousness is unsteady; deep within, he is filled
        with sexual desire, anger and egotism. Deep within is the great
        thirst and immense hunger; he wanders from door to door.  || 2
        ||   Those who die in the Word of the Guru's Shabad are
        reborn; they find the door of liberation. With constant peace
        and tranquility deep within, they enshrine the Lord within their
        hearts.  || 3 ||   As it pleases Him, He inspires us to act. Nothing
        else can be done. O Nanak, the Gurmukh contemplates the Word of
        the Shabad, and is blessed with the glorious greatness of the
        Lord's Name.  || 4 || 8 || 18 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:
        Lost in egotism, Maya and attachment, the mortal earns pain,
        and eats pain. The great disease, the rabid disease of greed,
        is deep within him; he wanders around indiscriminately.  || 1
        ||   The life of the self-willed manmukh in this world is cursed.
        He does not remember the Lord's Name, even in his dreams.
        He is never in love with the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   He acts like a beast, and does not understand anything.
        Practicing falsehood, he becomes false. But when the mortal meets
        the True Guru, his way of looking at the world changes. How rare
        are those humble beings who seek and find the Lord.  || 2 || 
        That person, whose heart is forever filled with the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, obtains the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue. By Guru's
        Grace, he finds the Perfect Lord; the egotistical pride of his
        mind is eradicated.  || 3 ||   The Creator Himself acts, and causes
        all to act. He Himself places us on the path. <br>

      <p> He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness; O Nanak,
        he merges in the Naam.  || 4 || 9 || 19 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:
        Upon my writing tablet, I write the Name of the Lord, the Lord
        of the Universe, the Lord of the World. In the love of duality,
        the mortals are caught in the noose of the Messenger of Death.
        The True Guru nurtures and sustains me. The Lord, the Giver of
        peace, is always with me.  || 1 ||   Following his Guru's
        instructions, Prahlaad chanted the Lord's Name; he was
        a child, but he was not afraid when his teacher yelled at him.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Prahlaad's mother gave her beloved
        son some advice: &quot;My son, you must abandon the Lord's
        Name, and save your life!&quot; Prahlaad said: &quot;Listen,
        O my mother; I shall never give up the Lord's Name. My
        Guru has taught me this.&quot;  || 2 ||   Sandaa and Markaa,
        his teachers, went to his father the king, and complained: &quot;Prahlaad
        himself has gone astray, and he leads all the other pupils astray.&quot;
        In the court of the wicked king, a plan was hatched. God is the
        Savior of Prahlaad.  || 3 ||   With sword in hand, and with great
        egotistical pride, Prahlaad's father ran up to him. &quot;Where
        is your Lord, who will save you?&quot; In an instant, the Lord
        appeared in a dreadful form, and shattered the pillar. Harnaakhash
        was torn apart by His claws, and Prahlaad was saved.  || 4 ||
        The Dear Lord completes the tasks of the Saints. He saved twenty-one
        generations of Prahlaad's descendents. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, the poison of egotism is neutralized.
        O Nanak, through the Name of the Lord, the Saints are emancipated.
        || 5 || 10 || 20 ||   BHAIRAO,  THIRD MEHL:  The Lord Himself
        makes demons pursue the Saints, and He Himself saves them. Those
        who remain forever in Your Sanctuary, O Lord - their minds
        are never touched by sorrow.  || 1 ||   In each and every age,
        the Lord saves the honor of His devotees. Prahlaad, the demon's
        son, knew nothing of the Hindu morning prayer, the Gayatri, and
        nothing about ceremonial water-offerings to his ancestors; but
        through the Word of the Shabad, he was united in the Lord's
        Union.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Night and day, he performed devotional
        worship service, day and night, and through the Shabad, his duality
        was eradicated. Those who are imbued with Truth are immaculate
        and pure; the True Lord abides within their minds.  || 2 ||  
        The fools in duality read, but they do not understand anything;
        they waste their lives uselessly. The wicked demon slandered the
        Saint, and stirred up trouble.  || 3 ||   Prahlaad did not read
        in duality, and he did not abaodon the Lord's Name; he
        was not afraid of any fear. The Dear Lord became the Savior of
        the Saint, and the demonic Death could not even approach him.
        || 4 ||   The Lord Himself saved his honor, and blessed his devotee
        with glorious greatness. O Nanak, Harnaakhash was torn apart by
        the Lord with His claws; the blind demon knew nothing of the Lord's
        Court.  || 5 || 11 || 21 || 8 || 21 || 29 || <br>

        the Company of the Holy, sing of the Lord. Follow the Guru's
        Teachings, and you shall obtain the Lord, the Source of Nectar.
        || 2 ||   Bathe in the pool of ambrosial nectar, the spiritual
        wisdom of the Holy Guru. All sins and residues of past mistakes
        will be eliminated and eradicated.  || 3 ||   You Yourself are
        the Creator, the Support of the Universe. Please unite servant
        Nanak with Yourself; he is the slave of Your slaves.  || 4 ||
        1 ||   BHAIRAO,  FOURTH MEHL:  Fruitful is that moment when the
        Lord's Name is spoken. Following the Guru's Teachings,
        all pains are taken away.  || 1 ||   O my mind, vibrate the Name
        of the Lord. O Lord, be merciful, and unite me with the Perfect
        Guru. Joining with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I shall
        cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate
        on the Life of the World; remember the Lord in your mind. Millions
        upon millions of your sins shall be taken away.  || 2 ||   In
        the Sat Sangat, apply the dust of the feet of the holy to your
        face; this is how to bathe in the sixty-eight sacred shrines,
        and the Ganges.  || 3 ||   I am a fool; the Lord has shown mercy
        to me. The Savior Lord has saved servant Nanak.  || 4 || 2 ||
        BHAIRAO,  FOURTH MEHL:  To do good deeds is the best rosary.
        Chant on the beads within your heart, and it shall go along with
        you.  || 1 ||   Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the Lord
        of the forest. Have mercy on me, Lord, and unite me with the Sat
        Sangat, the True Congregation, so that I may be released from
        Maya's noose of death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whoever, as
        Gurmukh, serves and works hard, is molded and shaped in the true
        mint of the Shabad, the Word of God.  || 2 ||   The Guru has revealed
        to me the Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord. Searching within
        the body-village, I have found the Lord.  || 3 ||   I am just
        a child; the Lord is my Father, who nurtures and cherishes me.
        Please save servant Nanak, Lord; bless him with Your Glance of
        Grace.  || 4 || 3 ||   BHAIRAO,  FOURTH MEHL:  All hearts are
        Yours, Lord; You are in all. There is nothing at all except You.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate on the Lord, the Giver of peace.
        I praise You, O Lord God, You are my Father.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Wherever I look, I see only the Lord God. All are under Your
        control; there is no other at all.  || 2 ||   O Lord, when it
        is Your Will to save someone, then nothing can threaten him. 
        || 3 ||   You are totally pervading and permeating the waters,
        the lands, the skies and all places. Servant Nanak meditates on
        the Ever-present Lord.  || 4 || 4 || <br>

      <p> One who has such destiny inscribed on his forehead, follows the
        Guru's Teachings, and contemplates the Name of the Lord
        within his heart.  || 1 ||   Enshrine Him in your heart, and meditate
        on the Lord. The five plundering thieves are in the body-village;
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord has beaten
        them and driven them out.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those whose minds
        are satisfied with the Lord - the Lord Himself resolves
        their affairs. Their subservience and their dependence on other
        people is ended; the Creator Lord is on their side.  || 2 || 
        If something were beyond the realm of the Lord's Power,
        only then would we have recourse to consult someone else. Whatever
        the Lord does is good. Meditate on the Name of the Lord, night
        and day.  || 3 ||   Whatever the Lord does, He does by Himself.
        He does not ask or consult anyone else. O Nanak, meditate forever
        on God; granting His Grace, He unites us with the True Guru. 
        || 4 || 1 || 5 ||   BHAIRAO,  FOURTH MEHL:  O my Lord and Master,
        please unite me with the Holy people; meditating on You, I am
        saved. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, my mind
        blossoms forth. Each and every moment, I am a sacrifice to them.
        || 1 ||   Meditate within your heart on the Name of the Lord.
        Show Mercy, Mercy to me, O Father of the World, O my Lord and
        Master; make me the water-carrier of the slave of Your slaves.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Their intellect is sublime and exalted,
        and so is their honor; the Lord, the Lord of the forest, abides
        within their hearts. O my Lord and Master, please link me to the
        service of those who meditate in remembrance on You, and are saved.
        || 2 ||   Those who do not find such a Holy True Guru are beaten,
        and driven out of the Court of the Lord. These slanderous people
        have no honor or reputation; their noses are cut by the Creator
        Lord.  || 3 ||   The Lord Himself speaks, and the Lord Himself
        inspires all to speak; He is Immaculate and Formless, and needs
        no sustenance. O Lord, he alone meets You, whom You cause to meet.
        Says servant Nanak, I am a wretched creature. What can I do? 
        || 4 || 2 || 6 ||   BHAIRAO,  FOURTH MEHL:  That is Your True
        Congregation, Lord, where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises
        are heard. The minds of those who listen to the Lord's
        Name are drenched with bliss; I worship their feet continually.
        || 1 ||   Meditating on the Lord, the Life of the World, the
        mortals cross over. Your Names are so many, they are countless,
        O Lord. This tongue of mine cannot even count them.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   O Gursikhs, chant the Lord's Name, and sing
        the Praises of the Lord. Take the Guru's Teachings, and
        meditate on the Lord. Whoever listens to the Guru's Teachings
        - that humble being receives countless comforts and pleasures
        from the Lord.  || 2 ||   Blessed is the ancestry, blessed is
        the father, and blessed is that mother who gave birth to this
        humble servant. Those who meditate on my Lord, Har, Har, with
        every breath and morsel of food - those humble servants
        of the Lord look beautiful in the True Court of the Lord.  ||
        3 ||   O Lord, Har, Har, Your Names are profound and infinite;
        Your devotees cherish them deep within. Servant Nanak has obained
        the wisdom of the Guru's Teachings; meditating on the Lord,
        Har, Har, he crosses over to the other side.  || 4 || 3 || 7 ||
