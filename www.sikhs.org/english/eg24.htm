      <p> In this world, no one accomplishes anything by himself. O Nanak,
        everything is done by God.  || 51 ||   SHALOK:  Because of the
        balance due on his account, he can never be released; he makes
        mistakes each and every moment. O Forgiving Lord, please forgive
        me, and carry Nanak across.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  The sinner is
        unfaithful to himself; he is ignorant, with shallow understanding.
        He does not know the essence of all, the One who gave him body,
        soul and peace. For the sake of personal profit and Maya, he goes
        out, searching in the ten directions. He does not enshrine the
        Generous Lord God, the Great Giver, in his mind, even for an instant.
        Greed, falsehood, corruption and emotional attachment  -  these
        are what he collects within his mind. The worst perverts, thieves
        and slanderers  -  he passes his time with them. But if it
        pleases You, Lord, then You forgive the counterfeit along with
        the genuine. O Nanak, if it pleases the Supreme Lord God, then
        even a stone will float on water.  || 52 ||   SHALOK:  Eating,
        drinking, playing and laughing, I have wandered through countless
        incarnations. Please, God, lift me up and out of the terrifying
        world-ocean. Nanak seeks Your Support.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  Playing,
        playing, I have been reincarnated countless times, but this has
        only brought pain. Troubles are removed, when one meets with the
        Holy; immerse yourself in the Word of the True Guru. Adopting
        an attitude of tolerance, and gathering truth, partake of the
        Ambrosial Nectar of the Name. When my Lord and Master showed His
        Great Mercy, I found peace, happiness and bliss. My merchandise
        has arrived safely, and I have made a great profit; I have returned
        home with honor. The Guru has given me great consolation, and
        the Lord God has come to meet me. He Himself has acted, and He
        Himself acts. He was in the past, and He shall be in the future.
        O Nanak, praise the One, who is contained in each and every heart.
        || 53 ||   SHALOK:  O God, I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Merciful
        Lord, Ocean of compassion. One whose mind is filled with the One
        Word of the Lord, O Nanak, becomes totally blissful.  || 1 ||
        PAUREE:  In the Word, God established the three worlds. Created
        from the Word, the Vedas are contemplated. From the Word, came
        the Shaastras, Simritees and Puraanas. From the Word, came the
        sound current of the Naad, speeches and explanations. From the
        Word, comes the way of liberation from fear and doubt. From the
        Word, come religious rituals, karma, sacredness and Dharma. In
        the visible universe, the Word is seen. O Nanak, the Supreme Lord
        God remains unattached and untouched.  || 54 ||   SHALOK:  With
        pen in hand, the Inaccessible Lord writes man's destiny on
        his forehead. The Lord of Incomparable Beauty is involved with
        all. I cannot describe Your Praises with my mouth, O Lord. Nanak
        is fascinated, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan;
        he is a sacrifice to You.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  O Immovable Lord,
        O Supreme Lord God, Imperishable, Destroyer of sins: O Perfect,
        All-pervading Lord, Destroyer of pain, Treasure of virtue: O Companion,
        Formless, Absolute Lord, Support of all: O Lord of the Universe,
        Treasure of excellence, with clear eternal understanding: Most
        Remote of the Remote, Lord God: You are, You were, and You shall
        always be. O Constant Companion of the Saints, You are the Support
        of the unsupported. O my Lord and Master, I am Your slave. I am
        worthless, I have no worth at all. </p>

      <p> Nanak: grant me the Gift of Your Name, Lord, that I may string
        it and keep it within my heart.  || 55 ||   SHALOK:  The Divine
        Guru is our mother, the Divine Guru is our father; the Divine
        Guru is our Lord and Master, the Transcendent Lord. The Divine
        Guru is my companion, the Destroyer of ignorance; the Divine Guru
        is my relative and brother. The Divine Guru is the Giver, the
        Teacher of the Lord's Name. The Divine Guru is the Mantra
        which never fails. The Divine Guru is the image of peace, truth
        and wisdom. The Divine Guru is the Philosopher's Stone  - 
        touching it, one is transformed. The Divine Guru is the sacred
        shrine of pilgrimage, and the pool of divine nectar; bathing in
        the Guru's wisdom, one experiences the Infinite. The Divine
        Guru is the Creator, and the Destroyer of all sins; the Divine
        Guru is the Purifier of sinners. The Divine Guru existed in the
        very beginning, throughout the ages, in each and every age. The
        Divine Guru is the Mantra of the Lord's Name; chanting it,
        one is saved. O God, please be merciful to me, that I may be with
        the Divine Guru; I am a foolish sinner, but holding onto Him,
        I will be carried across. The Divine Guru is the True Guru, the
        Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord; Nanak bows in humble
        reverence to the Lord, the Divine Guru.  || 1 ||   Read this Shalok
        at the beginning, and at the end.  || </p>

      </center>
      <p> I bow to the Primal Guru. I bow to the Guru of the ages. I bow
        to the True Guru. I bow to the Great, Divine Guru.  || 1 ||  
        ASHTAPADEE:  Meditate, meditate, meditate in remembrance of Him,
        and find peace. Worry and anguish shall be dispelled from your
        body. Remember in praise the One who pervades the whole Universe.
        His Name is chanted by countless people, in so many ways. The
        Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees, the purest of utterances,
        were created from the One Word of the Name of the Lord. That one,
        in whose soul the One Lord dwells  -  the praises of his glory
        cannot be recounted. Those who yearn only for the blessing of
        Your Darshan  -  Nanak: save me along with them!  || 1 || 
        Sukhmani: Peace of Mind, the Nectar of the Name of God. The minds
        of the devotees abide in a joyful peace.  || Pause ||   Remembering
        God, one does not have to enter into the womb again. Remembering
        God, the pain of death is dispelled. Remembering God, death is
        eliminated. Remembering God, one's enemies are repelled.
        Remembering God, no obstacles are met. Remembering God, one remains
        awake and aware, night and day. Remembering God, one is not touched
        by fear. Remembering God, one does not suffer sorrow. The meditative
        remembrance of God is in the Company of the Holy. All treasures,
        O Nanak, are in the Love of the Lord.  || 2 ||   In the remembrance
        of God are wealth, miraculous spiritual powers and the nine treasures.
        In the remembrance of God are knowledge, meditation and the essence
        of wisdom. In the remembrance of God are chanting, intense meditation
        and devotional worship. In the remembrance of God, duality is
        removed. In the remembrance of God are purifying baths at sacred
        shrines of pilgrimage. In the remembrance of God, one attains
        honor in the Court of the Lord. In the remembrance of God, one
        becomes good. In the remembrance of God, one flowers in fruition. </p>

      <p> They alone remember Him in meditation, whom He inspires to meditate.
        Nanak grasps the feet of those humble beings.  || 3 ||   The remembrance
        of God is the highest and most exalted of all. In the remembrance
        of God, many are saved. In the remembrance of God, thirst is quenched.
        In the remembrance of God, all things are known. In the remembrance
        of God, there is no fear of death. In the remembrance of God,
        hopes are fulfilled. In the remembrance of God, the filth of the
        mind is removed. The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is
        absorbed into the heart. God abides upon the tongues of His Saints.
        Nanak is the servant of the slave of His slaves.  || 4 ||   Those
        who remember God are wealthy. Those who remember God are honorable.
        Those who remember God are approved. Those who remember God are
        the most distinguished persons. Those who remember God are not
        lacking. Those who remember God are the rulers of all. Those who
        remember God dwell in peace. Those who remember God are immortal
        and eternal. They alone hold to the remembrance of Him, unto whom
        He Himself shows His Mercy. Nanak begs for the dust of their feet.
        || 5 ||   Those who remember God generously help others. Those
        who remember God  -  to them, I am forever a sacrifice. Those
        who remember God  -  their faces are beautiful. Those who remember
        God abide in peace. Those who remember God conquer their souls.
        Those who remember God have a pure and spotless lifestyle. Those
        who remember God experience all sorts of joys. Those who remember
        God abide near the Lord. By the Grace of the Saints, one remains
        awake and aware, night and day. O Nanak, this meditative remembrance
        comes only by perfect destiny.  || 6 ||   Remembering God, one's
        works are accomplished. Remembering God, one never grieves. Remembering
        God, one speaks the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Remembering
        God, one is absorbed into the state of intuitive ease. Remembering
        God, one attains the unchanging position. Remembering God, the
        heart-lotus blossoms forth. Remembering God, the unstruck melody
        vibrates. The peace of the meditative remembrance of God has no
        end or limitation. They alone remember Him, upon whom God bestows
        His Grace. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of those humble beings. 
        || 7 ||   Remembering the Lord, His devotees are famous and radiant.
        Remembering the Lord, the Vedas were composed. Remembering the
        Lord, we become Siddhas, celibates and givers. Remembering the
        Lord, the lowly become known in all four directions. For the remembrance
        of the Lord, the whole world was established. Remember, remember
        in meditation the Lord, the Creator, the Cause of causes. For
        the remembrance of the Lord, He created the whole creation. In
        the remembrance of the Lord, He Himself is Formless. By His Grace,
        He Himself bestows understanding. O Nanak, the Gurmukh attains
        the remembrance of the Lord.  || 8 || 1 ||   SHALOK:  O Destroyer
        of the pains and the suffering of the poor, O Master of each and
        every heart, O Masterless One: I have come seeking Your Sanctuary. </p>

      <p> O God, please be with Nanak!  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  Where there
        is no mother, father, children, friends or siblings  -  O my
        mind, there, only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, shall be with
        you as your help and support. Where the great and terrible Messenger
        of Death shall try to crush you, there, only the Naam shall go
        along with you. Where the obstacles are so very heavy, the Name
        of the Lord shall rescue you in an instant. By performing countless
        religious rituals, you shall not be saved. The Name of the Lord
        washes off millions of sins. As Gurmukh, chant the Naam, O my
        mind. O Nanak, you shall obtain countless joys.  || 1 ||   The
        rulers of the all the world are unhappy; one who chants the Name
        of the Lord becomes happy. Acquiring hundreds of thousands and
        millions, your desires shall not be contained. Chanting the Name
        of the Lord, you shall find release. By the countless pleasures
        of Maya, your thirst shall not be quenched. Chanting the Name
        of the Lord, you shall be satisfied. Upon that path where you
        must go all alone, there, only the Lord's Name shall go with
        you to sustain you. On such a Name, O my mind, meditate forever.
        O Nanak, as Gurmukh, you shall obtain the state of supreme dignity.
        || 2 ||   You shall not be saved by hundreds of thousands and
        millions of helping hands. Chanting the Naam, you shall be lifted
        up and carried across. Where countless misfortunes threaten to
        destroy you, the Name of the Lord shall rescue you in an instant.
        Through countless incarnations, people are born and die. Chanting
        the Name of the Lord, you shall come to rest in peace. The ego
        is polluted by a filth which can never be washed off. The Name
        of the Lord erases millions of sins. Chant such a Name with love,
        O my mind. O Nanak, it is obtained in the Company of the Holy.
        || 3 ||   On that path where the miles cannot be counted, there,
        the Name of the Lord shall be your sustenance. On that journey
        of total, pitch-black darkness, the Name of the Lord shall be
        the Light with you. On that journey where no one knows you, with
        the Name of the Lord, you shall be recognized. Where there is
        awesome and terrible heat and blazing sunshine, there, the Name
        of the Lord will give you shade. Where thirst, O my mind, torments
        you to cry out, there, O Nanak, the Ambrosial Name, Har, Har,
        shall rain down upon you.  || 4 ||   Unto the devotee, the Naam
        is an article of daily use. The minds of the humble Saints are
        at peace. The Name of the Lord is the Support of His servants.
        By the Name of the Lord, millions have been saved. The Saints
        chant the Praises of the Lord, day and night. Har, Har  - 
        the Lord's Name  -  the Holy use it as their healing medicine.
        The Lord's Name is the treasure of the Lord's servant.
        The Supreme Lord God has blessed His humble servant with this
        gift. Mind and body are imbued with ecstasy in the Love of the
        One Lord. O Nanak, careful and discerning understanding is the
        way of the Lord's humble servant.  || 5 ||   The Name of
        the Lord is the path of liberation for His humble servants. With
        the food of the Name of the Lord, His servants are satisfied.
        The Name of the Lord is the beauty and delight of His servants.
        Chanting the Lord's Name, one is never blocked by obstacles.
        The Name of the Lord is the glorious greatness of His servants.
        Through the Name of the Lord, His servants obtain honor. </p>

        Chanting the Lord's Name, there is no separation from Him.
        His servants are imbued with the service of the Lord's Name.
        O Nanak, worship the Lord, the Lord Divine, Har, Har.  || 6 ||
        The Lord's Name, Har, Har, is the treasure of wealth of
        His servants. The treasure of the Lord has been bestowed on His
        servants by God Himself. The Lord, Har, Har is the All-powerful
        Protection of His servants. His servants know no other than the
        Lord's Magnificence. Through and through, His servants are
        imbued with the Lord's Love. In deepest Samaadhi, they are
        intoxicated with the essence of the Naam. Twenty-four hours a
        day, His servants chant Har, Har. The devotees of the Lord are
        known and respected; they do not hide in secrecy. Through devotion
        to the Lord, many have been liberated. O Nanak, along with His
        servants, many others are saved.  || 7 ||   This Elysian Tree
        of miraculous powers is the Name of the Lord. The Khaamadhayn,
        the cow of miraculous powers, is the singing of the Glory of the
        Lord's Name, Har, Har. Highest of all is the Lord's
        Speech. Hearing the Naam, pain and sorrow are removed. The Glory
        of the Naam abides in the hearts of His Saints. By the Saint's
        kind intervention, all guilt is dispelled. The Society of the
        Saints is obtained by great good fortune. Serving the Saint, one
        meditates on the Naam. There is nothing equal to the Naam. O Nanak,
        rare are those, who, as Gurmukh, obtain the Naam.  || 8 || 2 ||
        SHALOK:  The many Shaastras and the many Simritees  -  I
        have seen and searched through them all. They are not equal to
        Har, Haray  -  O Nanak, the Lord's Invaluable Name.  ||
        1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  Chanting, intense meditation, spiritual wisdom
        and all meditations; the six schools of philosophy and sermons
        on the scriptures; the practice of Yoga and righteous conduct;
        the renunciation of everything and wandering around in the wilderness;
        the performance of all sorts of works; donations to charities
        and offerings of jewels to fire; cutting the body apart and making
        the pieces into ceremonial fire offerings; keeping fasts and making
        vows of all sorts  -  none of these are equal to the contemplation
        of the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, if, as Gurmukh, one chants the
        Naam, even once.  || 1 ||   You may roam over the nine continents
        of the world and live a very long life; you may become a great
        ascetic and a master of disciplined meditation and burn yourself
        in fire; you may give away gold, horses, elephants and land; you
        may practice techniques of inner cleansing and all sorts of Yogic
        postures; you may adopt the self-mortifying ways of the Jains
        and great spiritual disciplines; piece by piece, you may cut your
        body apart; but even so, the filth of your ego shall not depart.
        There is nothing equal to the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, as Gurmukh,
        chant the Naam, and obtain salvation.  || 2 ||   With your mind
        filled with desire, you may give up your body at a sacred shrine
        of pilgrimage; but even so, egotistical pride shall not be removed
        from your mind. You may practice cleansing day and night, but
        the filth of your mind shall not leave your body. You may subject
        your body to all sorts of disciplines, but your mind will never
        be rid of its corruption. You may wash this transitory body with
        loads of water, but how can a wall of mud be washed clean? O my
        mind, the Glorious Praise of the Name of the Lord is the highest;
        O Nanak, the Naam has saved so many of the worst sinners.  ||
        3 ||   Even with great cleverness, the fear of death clings to
        you. </p>

      <p> You try all sorts of things, but your thirst is still not satisfied.
        Wearing various religious robes, the fire is not extinguished.
        Even making millions of efforts, you shall not be accepted in
        the Court of the Lord. You cannot escape to the heavens, or to
        the nether regions, if you are entangled in emotional attachment
        and the net of Maya. All other efforts are punished by the Messenger
        of Death, which accepts nothing at all, except meditation on the
        Lord of the Universe. Chanting the Name of the Lord, sorrow is
        dispelled. O Nanak, chant it with intuitive ease.  || 4 ||   One
        who prays for the four cardinal blessings should commit himself
        to the service of the Saints. If you wish to erase your sorrows,
        sing the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within your heart. If you
        long for honor for yourself, then renounce your ego in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy. If you fear the cycle of birth
        and death, then seek the Sanctuary of the Holy. Those who thirst
        for the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan  -  Nanak is a
        sacrifice, a sacrifice to them.  || 5 ||   Among all persons,
        the supreme person is the one who gives up his egotistical pride
        in the Company of the Holy. One who sees himself as lowly, shall
        be accounted as the highest of all. One whose mind is the dust
        of all, recognizes the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in each and
        every heart. One who eradicates cruelty from within his own mind,
        looks upon all the world as his friend. One who looks upon pleasure
        and pain as one and the same, O Nanak, is not affected by sin
        or virtue.  || 6 ||   To the poor, Your Name is wealth. To the
        homeless, Your Name is home. To the dishonored, You, O God, are
        honor. To all, You are the Giver of gifts. O Creator Lord, Cause
        of causes, O Lord and Master, Inner-knower, Searcher of all hearts:
        You alone know Your own condition and state. You Yourself, God,
        are imbued with Yourself. You alone can celebrate Your Praises.
        O Nanak, no one else knows.  || 7 ||   Of all religions, the best
        religion is to chant the Name of the Lord and maintain pure conduct.
        Of all religious rituals, the most sublime ritual is to erase
        the filth of the dirty mind in the Company of the Holy. Of all
        efforts, the best effort is to chant the Name of the Lord in the
        heart, forever. Of all speech, the most ambrosial speech is to
        hear the Lord's Praise and chant it with the tongue. Of all
        places, the most sublime place, O Nanak, is that heart in which
        the Name of the Lord abides.  || 8 || 3 ||   SHALOK:  You worthless,
        ignorant fool  -  dwell upon God forever. Cherish in your consciousness
        the One who created you; O Nanak, He alone shall go along with
        you.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  Think of the Glory of the All-pervading
        Lord, O mortal; what is your origin, and what is your appearance?
        He who fashioned, adorned and decorated you  -  in the fire
        of the womb, He preserved you. In your infancy, He gave you milk
        to drink. In the flower of your youth, He gave you food, pleasure
        and understanding. As you grow old, family and friends are there
        to feed you as you rest. </p>

      <p> This worthless person has not appreciated in the least, all the
        good deeds done for him. If you bless him with forgiveness, O
        Nanak, only then will he be saved.  || 1 ||   By His Grace, you
        abide in comfort upon the earth. With your children, siblings,
        friends and spouse, you laugh. By His Grace, you drink in cool
        water. You have peaceful breezes and priceless fire. By His Grace,
        you enjoy all sorts of pleasures. You are provided with all the
        necessities of life. He gave you hands, feet, ears, eyes and tongue,
        and yet, you forsake Him and attach yourself to others. Such sinful
        mistakes cling to the blind fools; Nanak: uplift and save them,
        God!  || 2 ||   From beginning to end, He is our Protector, and
        yet, the ignorant do not give their love to Him. Serving Him,
        the nine treasures are obtained, and yet, the foolish do not link
        their minds with Him. Our Lord and Master is Ever-present, forever
        and ever, and yet, the spiritually blind believe that He is far
        away. In His service, one obtains honor in the Court of the Lord,
        and yet, the ignorant fool forgets Him. Forever and ever, this
        person makes mistakes; O Nanak, the Infinite Lord is our Saving
        Grace.  || 3 ||   Forsaking the jewel, they are engrossed with
        a shell. They renounce Truth and embrace falsehood. That which
        passes away, they believe to be permanent. That which is immanent,
        they believe to be far off. They struggle for what they must eventually
        leave. They turn away from the Lord, their Help and Support, who
        is always with them. They wash off the sandalwood paste; like
        donkeys, they are in love with the mud. They have fallen into
        the deep, dark pit. Nanak: lift them up and save them, O Merciful
        Lord God!  || 4 ||   They belong to the human species, but they
        act like animals. They curse others day and night. Outwardly,
        they wear religious robes, but within is the filth of Maya. They
        cannot conceal this, no matter how hard they try. Outwardly, they
        display knowledge, meditation and purification, but within clings
        the dog of greed. The fire of desire rages within; outwardly they
        apply ashes to their bodies. There is a stone around their neck
        -  how can they cross the unfathomable ocean? Those, within
        whom God Himself abides  -  O Nanak, those humble beings are
        intuitively absorbed in the Lord.  || 5 ||   By listening, how
        can the blind find the path? Take hold of his hand, and then he
        can reach his destination. How can a riddle be understood by the
        deaf? Say 'night', and he thinks you said 'day'.
        How can the mute sing the Songs of the Lord? He may try, but his
        voice will fail him. How can the cripple climb up the mountain?
        He simply cannot go there. O Creator, Lord of Mercy  -  Your
        humble servant prays; Nanak: by Your Grace, please save me.  ||
        6 ||   The Lord, our Help and Support, is always with us, but
        the mortal does not remember Him. He shows love to his enemies.
        He lives in a castle of sand. He enjoys the games of pleasure
        and the tastes of Maya. He believes them to be permanent  - 
        this is the belief of his mind. Death does not even come to mind
        for the fool. Hate, conflict, sexual desire, anger, emotional
        attachment, falsehood, corruption, immense greed and deceit: </p>

      <p> So many lifetimes are wasted in these ways. Nanak: uplift them,
        and redeem them, O Lord  -  show Your Mercy!  || 7 ||   You
        are our Lord and Master; to You, I offer this prayer. This body
        and soul are all Your property. You are our mother and father;
        we are Your children. In Your Grace, there are so many joys! No
        one knows Your limits. O Highest of the High, Most Generous God,
        the whole creation is strung on Your thread. That which has come
        from You is under Your Command. You alone know Your state and
        extent. Nanak, Your slave, is forever a sacrifice.  || 8 || 4
        ||   SHALOK:  One who renounces God the Giver, and attaches himself
        to other affairs  -  O Nanak, he shall never succeed. Without
        the Name, he shall lose his honor.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  He
        obtains ten things, and puts them behind him; for the sake of
        one thing withheld, he forfeits his faith. But what if that one
        thing were not given, and the ten were taken away? Then, what
        could the fool say or do? Our Lord and Master cannot be moved
        by force. Unto Him, bow forever in adoration. That one, unto whose
        mind God seems sweet  -  all pleasures come to abide in his
        mind. One who abides by the Lord's Will, O Nanak, obtains
        all things.  || 1 ||   God the Banker gives endless capital to
        the mortal, who eats, drinks and expends it with pleasure and
        joy. If some of this capital is later taken back by the Banker,
        the ignorant person shows his anger. He himself destroys his own
        credibility, and he shall not again be trusted. When one offers
        to the Lord, that which belongs to the Lord, and willingly abides
        by the Will of God's Order, the Lord will make him happy
        four times over. O Nanak, our Lord and Master is merciful forever.
        || 2 ||   The many forms of attachment to Maya shall surely pass
        away  -  know that they are transitory. People fall in love
        with the shade of the tree, and when it passes away, they feel
        regret in their minds. Whatever is seen, shall pass away; and
        yet, the blindest of the blind cling to it. One who gives her
        love to a passing traveler  -  nothing shall come into her
        hands in this way. O mind, the love of the Name of the Lord bestows
        peace. O Nanak, the Lord, in His Mercy, unites us with Himself.
        || 3 ||   False are body, wealth, and all relations. False are
        ego, possessiveness and Maya. False are power, youth, wealth and
        property. False are sexual desire and wild anger. False are chariots,
        elephants, horses and expensive clothes. False is the love of
        gathering wealth, and reveling in the sight of it. False are deception,
        emotional attachment and egotistical pride. False are pride and
        self-conceit. Only devotional worship is permanent, and the Sanctuary
        of the Holy. Nanak lives by meditating, meditating on the Lotus
        Feet of the Lord.  || 4 ||   False are the ears which listen to
        the slander of others. False are the hands which steal the wealth
        of others. </p>

      <p> False are the eyes which gaze upon the beauty of another's
        wife. False is the tongue which enjoys delicacies and external
        tastes. False are the feet which run to do evil to others. False
        is the mind which covets the wealth of others. False is the body
        which does not do good to others. False is the nose which inhales
        corruption. Without understanding, everything is false. Fruitful
        is the body, O Nanak, which takes to the Lord's Name.  ||
        5 ||   The life of the faithless cynic is totally useless. Without
        the Truth, how can anyone be pure? Useless is the body of the
        spiritually blind, without the Name of the Lord. From his mouth,
        a foul smell issues forth. Without the remembrance of the Lord,
        day and night pass in vain, like the crop which withers without
        rain. Without meditation on the Lord of the Universe, all works
        are in vain, like the wealth of a miser, which lies useless. Blessed,
        blessed are those, whose hearts are filled with the Name of the
        Lord. Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to them.  || 6 ||   He
        says one thing, and does something else. There is no love in his
        heart, and yet with his mouth he talks tall. The Omniscient Lord
        God is the Knower of all. He is not impressed by outward display.
        One who does not practice what he preaches to others, shall come
        and go in reincarnation, through birth and death. One whose inner
        being is filled with the Formless Lord  -  by his teachings,
        the world is saved. Those who are pleasing to You, God, know You.
        Nanak falls at their feet.  || 7 ||   Offer your prayers to the
        Supreme Lord God, who knows everything. He Himself values His
        own creatures. He Himself, by Himself, makes the decisions. To
        some, He appears far away, while others perceive Him near at hand.
        He is beyond all efforts and clever tricks. He knows all the ways
        and means of the soul. Those with whom He is pleased are attached
        to the hem of His robe. He is pervading all places and interspaces.
        Those upon whom He bestows His favor, become His servants. Each
        and every moment, O Nanak, meditate on the Lord.  || 8 || 5 ||
        SHALOK:  Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment
        -  may these be gone, and egotism as well. Nanak seeks the
        Sanctuary of God; please bless me with Your Grace, O Divine Guru.
        || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  By His Grace, you partake of the thirty-six
        delicacies; enshrine that Lord and Master within your mind. By
        His Grace, you apply scented oils to your body; remembering Him,
        the supreme status is obtained. By His Grace, you dwell in the
        palace of peace; meditate forever on Him within your mind. By
        His Grace, you abide with your family in peace; keep His remembrance
        upon your tongue, twenty-four hours a day. By His Grace, you enjoy
        tastes and pleasures; O Nanak, meditate forever on the One, who
        is worthy of meditation.  || 1 ||   By His Grace, you wear silks
        and satins; why abandon Him, to attach yourself to another? By
        His Grace, you sleep in a cozy bed; O my mind, sing His Praises,
        twenty-four hours a day. </p>

        with your tongue, chant His Praises. By His Grace, you remain
        in the Dharma; O mind, meditate continually on the Supreme Lord
        God. Meditating on God, you shall be honored in His Court; O Nanak,
        you shall return to your true home with honor.  || 2 ||   By His
        Grace, you have a healthy, golden body; attune yourself to that
        Loving Lord. By His Grace, your honor is preserved; O mind, chant
        the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, and find peace. By His Grace,
        all your deficits are covered; O mind, seek the Sanctuary of God,
        our Lord and Master. By His Grace, no one can rival you; O mind,
        with each and every breath, remember God on High. By His Grace,
        you obtained this precious human body; O Nanak, worship Him with
        devotion.  || 3 ||   By His Grace, you wear decorations; O mind,
        why are you so lazy? Why don't you remember Him in meditation?
        By His Grace, you have horses and elephants to ride; O mind, never
        forget that God. By His Grace, you have land, gardens and wealth;
        keep God enshrined in your heart. O mind, the One who formed your
        form  -  standing up and sitting down, meditate always on Him.
        Meditate on Him  -  the One Invisible Lord; here and hereafter,
        O Nanak, He shall save you.  || 4 ||   By His Grace, you give
        donations in abundance to charities; O mind, meditate on Him,
        twenty-four hours a day. By His Grace, you perform religious rituals
        and worldly duties; think of God with each and every breath. By
        His Grace, your form is so beautiful; constantly remember God,
        the Incomparably Beautiful One. By His Grace, you have such high
        social status; remember God always, day and night. By His Grace,
        your honor is preserved; by Guru's Grace, O Nanak, chant
        His Praises.  || 5 ||   By His Grace, you listen to the sound
        current of the Naad. By His Grace, you behold amazing wonders.
        By His Grace, you speak ambrosial words with your tongue. By His
        Grace, you abide in peace and ease. By His Grace, your hands move
        and work. By His Grace, you are completely fulfilled. By His Grace,
        you obtain the supreme status. By His Grace, you are absorbed
        into celestial peace. Why forsake God, and attach yourself to
        another? By Guru's Grace, O Nanak, awaken your mind!  ||
        6 ||   By His Grace, you are famous all over the world; never
        forget God from your mind. By His Grace, you have prestige; O
        foolish mind, meditate on Him! By His Grace, your works are completed;
        O mind, know Him to be close at hand. By His Grace, you find the
        Truth; O my mind, merge yourself into Him. By His Grace, everyone
        is saved; O Nanak, meditate, and chant His Chant.  || 7 ||   Those,
        whom He inspires to chant, chant His Name. Those, whom He inspires
        to sing, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. </p>

        the heart-lotus blossoms forth. When God is totally pleased, He
        comes to dwell in the mind. By God's Kind Mercy, the intellect
        is exalted. All treasures, O Lord, come by Your Kind Mercy. No
        one obtains anything by himself. As You have delegated, so do

        Holy.  || 1 ||   ASHTAPADEE:  In the Company of the Holy, one's

        Company of the Holy, one meets the Incomprehensible Lord. In the
        Company of the Holy, one flourishes forever. In the Company of
        the Holy, the five passions are brought to rest. In the Company

        friends. In the Company of the Holy, there is great purity. In
        the Company of the Holy, no one is hated. In the Company of the

        wanders. In the Company of the Holy, one obtains everlasting peace.
        In the Company of the Holy, one grasps the Incomprehensible. In
        the Company of the Holy, one can endure the unendurable. In the
