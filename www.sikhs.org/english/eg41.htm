      <p> The Lord created the Gopis and Krishna.  || 3 ||   The Lord ushered
        in the Dark Age, the Iron Age of Kali Yuga; three legs of religion
        were lost, and only the fourth leg remained intact. Acting in
        accordance with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the medicine
        of the Lord's Name is obtained. Singing the Kirtan of the
        Lord's Praises, divine peace is obtained. The season of singing
        the Lord's Praise has arrived; the Lord's Name is glorified,
        and the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, grows in the field of the
        body. In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, if one plants any other seed
        than the Name, all profit and capital is lost. Servant Nanak has
        found the Perfect Guru, who has revealed to him the Naam within
        his heart and mind. The Lord ushered in the Dark Age, the Iron
        Age of Kali Yuga; three legs of religion were lost, and only the
        fourth leg remained intact.  || 4 || 4 || 11 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  One whose mind is pleased with the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises, attains the supreme status; the Lord seems so sweet to
        her mind and body. She obtains the sublime essence of the Lord,
        Har, Har; through the Guru's Teachings, she meditates on
        the Lord, and the destiny written on her forehead is fulfilled.
        By that high destiny written on her forehead, she chants the Name
        of the Lord, her Husband, and through the Name of the Lord, she
        sings the Lord's Glorious Praises. the jewel of immense love
        sparkles on her forehead, and she is adorned with the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har. Her light blends with the Supreme Light, and
        she obtains God; meeting the True Guru, her mind is satisfied.
        One whose mind is pleased with the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises,
        attains the supreme status; the Lord seems sweet to her mind and
        body.  || 1 ||   Those who sing the Praises of the Lord, Har,
        Har, obtain the supreme status; they are the most exalted and
        acclaimed people. I bow at their feet; each and every moment,
        I wash the feet of those, unto whom the Lord seems sweet. The
        Lord seems sweet to them, and they obtain the supreme status;
        their faces are radiant and beautiful with good fortune. Under
        Guru's Instruction, they sing the Lord's Name, and wear
        the garland of the Lord's Name around their necks; they keep
        the Lord's Name in their throats. They look upon all with
        equality, and recognize the Supreme Soul, the Lord, pervading
        among all. Those who sing the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, obtain
        the supreme status; they are the most exalted and acclaimed people.
        || 2 ||   One whose mind is pleased with the Sat Sangat, the
        True Congregation, savors the sublime essence of the Lord; in
        the Sangat, is this essence of the Lord. He meditates in adoration
        upon the Lord, Har, Har, and through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, he blossoms forth. He plants no other seed. There is no
        Nectar, other than the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar. One who drinks
        it in, knows the way. Hail, hail to the Perfect Guru; through
        Him, God is found. Joining the Sangat, the Naam is understood.
        I serve the Naam, and I meditate on the Naam. Without the Naam,
        there is no other at all. One whose mind is pleased with the Sat
        Sangat, savors the sublime essence of the Lord; in the Sangat,
        is this essence of the Lord.  || 3 ||   O Lord God, shower Your
        Mercy upon me; I am just a stone. Please, carry me across, and
        lift me up with ease, through the Word of the Shabad. I am stuck
        in the swamp of emotional attachment, and I am sinking. O Lord
        God, please, take me by the arm. God took me by the arm, and I
        obtained the highest understanding; as His slave, I grasped the
        Guru's feet. </p>

      <p> I chant and meditate in adoration upon the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, according to the good destiny written upon my forehead. The
        Lord has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak, and the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, seems so sweet to his mind. O Lord God, shower
        Your Mercy upon me; I am just a stone. Please, carry me across,
        and lift me up with ease, through the Word of the Shabad.  ||
        4 || 5 || 12 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  One who chants the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har in his mind  -  the Lord is
        pleasing to his mind. In the mind of the devotees there is a great
        yearning for the Lord. Those humble beings who remain dead while
        yet alive, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar; through the Guru's Teachings,
        their minds embrace love for the Lord. Their minds love the Lord,
        Har, Har, and the Guru is Merciful to them. They are Jivan Mukta
        -  liberated while yet alive, and they are at peace. Their
        birth and death, through the Name of the Lord, are illustrious,
        and in their hearts and minds, the Lord, Har, Har, abides. The
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, abides in their minds, and through
        the Guru's Teachings, they savor the Lord, Har, Har; they drink
        in the sublime essence of the Lord with abandon. One who chants
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in his mind  -  the
        Lord is pleasing to his mind. In the mind of the devotees there
        is such a great yearning for the Lord.  || 1 ||   The people of
        the world do not like death; they try to hide from it. They are
        afraid that the Messenger of Death may catch them and take them
        away. Inwardly and outwardly, the Lord God is the One and Only;
        this soul cannot be concealed from Him. How can one keep one's
        soul, when the Lord wishes to have it? All things belong to Him,
        and He shall take them away. The self-willed manmukhs wander around
        in pathetic lamentation, trying all medicines and remedies. God,
        the Master, unto whom all things belong, shall take them away;
        the Lord's servant is redeemed by living the Word of the
        Shabad. The people of the world do not like death; they try to
        hide from it. They are afraid that the Messenger of Death may
        catch them and take them away.  || 2 ||   Death is pre-ordained;
        the Gurmukhs look beauteous, and the humble beings are saved,
        meditating on the Lord, Har, Har. Through the Lord they obtain
        honor, and through the Lord's Name, glorious greatness. In
        the Court of the Lord, they are robed in honor. Robed in honor
        in the Court of the Lord, in the perfection of the Lord's
        Name, they obtain peace through the Lord's Name. The pains
        of both birth and death are eliminated, and they merge into the
        Name of the Lord. The Lord's servants meet with God and merge
        into Oneness. The Lord's servant and God are one and the
        same. Death is pre-ordained; the Gurmukhs look beauteous, and
        the humble beings are saved, meditating on the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 3 ||   The people of the world are born, only to perish, and
        perish, and perish again. Only by attaching oneself to the Lord
        as Gurmukh, does one become permanent. The Guru implants His Mantra
        within the heart, and one savors the sublime essence of the Lord;
        the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord trickles into his mouth. Obtaining
        the Ambrosial Essence of the Lord, the dead are restored to life,
        and do not die again. Through the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        one obtains the immortal status, and merges into the Lord's
        Name. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the only Support and
        Anchor of servant Nanak; without the Naam, there is nothing else
        at all. The people of the world are born, only to perish, and
        perish, and perish again. Only by attaching oneself to the Lord
        as Gurmukh, does one become permanent.  || 4 || 6 || 13 || </p>

      <p> AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL,  CHHANT:  My Lord of the Universe is great,
        unapproachable, unfathomable, primal, immaculate and formless.
        His condition cannot be described; His Glorious Greatness is immeasurable.
        My Lord of the Universe is invisible and infinite. The Lord of
        the Universe is invisible, infinite and unlimited. He Himself
        knows Himself. What should these poor creatures say? How can they
        speak of and describe You? That Gurmukh who is blessed by Your
        Glance of Grace contemplates You. My Lord of the Universe is great,
        unapproachable, unfathomable, primal, immaculate and formless.
        || 1 ||   You, O Lord, O Primal Being, are the Limitless Creator;
        Your limits cannot be found. You are pervading and permeating
        each and every heart, everywhere, You are contained in all. Within
        the heart is the Transcendent, Supreme Lord God, whose limits
        cannot be found. He has no form or shape; He is unseen and unknown.
        The Gurmukh sees the unseen Lord. He remains in continual ecstasy,
        day and night, and is spontaneously absorbed into the Naam. You,
        O Lord, O Primal Being, are the Limitless Creator; Your limits
        cannot be found.  || 2 ||   You are the True, Transcendent Lord,
        forever imperishable. The Lord, Har, Har, is the treasure of virtue.
        The Lord God, Har, Har, is the One and only; there is no other
        at all. You Yourself are the all-knowing Lord. You are the all-knowing
        Lord, the most exalted and auspicious; there is no other as great
        as You. The Word of Your Shabad is pervading in all; whatever
        You do, comes to pass. The One Lord God is permeating all; the
        Gurmukh comes to understand the Lord's Name. You are the
        True, Transcendent Lord, forever imperishable. The Lord, Har,
        Har, is the treasure of virtue.  || 3 ||   You are the Creator
        of all, and all greatness is Yours. As it pleases Your Will, so
        do we act. As it pleases Your Will, so do we act. All are merged
        into Your Shabad. When it pleases Your Will, we obtain greatness
        through Your Shabad. The Gurmukh obtains wisdom, and eliminates
        his self-conceit, and remains absorbed in the Shabad. The Gurmukh
        obtains Your incomprehensible Shabad; O Nanak, he remains merged
        in the Naam. You are the Creator of all, and all greatness is
        Yours. As it pleases Your Will, so do we act.  || 4 || 7 || 14

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:

      </center>
      <p> My eyes are wet with the Nectar of the Lord, and my mind is imbued
        with His Love, O Lord King. The Lord applied His touch-stone to
        my mind, and found it one hundred per cent gold. As Gurmukh, I
        am dyed in the deep red of the poppy, and my mind and body are
        drenched with His Love. </p>

      <p> Servant Nanak is drenched with His Fragrance; blessed, blessed
        is his entire life.  || 1 ||   The Bani of the Lord's Love
        is the pointed arrow, which has pierced my mind, O Lord King.
        Only those who feel the pain of this love, know how to endure
        it. Those who die, and remain dead while yet alive, are said to
        be Jivan Mukta, liberated while yet alive. O Lord, unite servant
        Nanak with the True Guru, that he may cross over the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 2 ||   I am foolish and ignorant, but I have
        taken to His Sanctuary; may I merge in the Love of the Lord of
        the Universe, O Lord King. Through the Perfect Guru, I have obtained
        the Lord, and I beg for the one blessing of devotion to the Lord.
        My mind and body blossom forth through the Word of the Shabad;
        I meditate on the Lord of infinite waves. Meeting with the humble
        Saints, Nanak finds the Lord, in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
        || 3 ||   O Merciful to the meek, hear my prayer, O Lord God;
        You are my Master, O Lord King. I beg for the Sanctuary of the
        Lord's Name, Har, Har; please, place it in my mouth. It is
        the Lord's natural way to love His devotees; O Lord, please
        preserve my honor! Servant Nanak has entered His Sanctuary, and
        has been saved by the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 8 || 15 ||  
        AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  As Gurmukh, I searched and searched, and
        found the Lord, my Friend, my Sovereign Lord King. Within the
        walled fortress of my golden body, the Lord, Har, Har, is revealed.
        The Lord, Har, Har, is a jewel, a diamond; my mind and body are
        pierced through. By the great good fortune of pre-ordained destiny,
        I have found the Lord. Nanak is permeated with His sublime essence.
        || 1 ||   I stand by the roadside, and ask the way; I am just
        a youthful bride of the Lord King. The Guru has caused me to remember
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; I follow the Path to Him. The
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Support of my mind and body;
        I have burnt away the poison of ego. O True Guru, unite me with
        the Lord, unite me with the Lord, adorned with garlands of flowers.
        || 2 ||   O my Love, come and meet me as Gurmukh; I have been
        separated from You for so long, Lord King. My mind and body are
        sad; my eyes are wet with the Lord's sublime essence. Show
        me my Lord God, my Love, O Guru; meeting the Lord, my mind is
        pleased. I am just a fool, O Nanak, but the Lord has appointed
        me to perform His service.  || 3 ||   The Guru's body is
        drenched with Ambrosial Nectar; He sprinkles it upon me, O Lord
        King. Those whose minds are pleased with the Word of the Guru's
        Bani, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar again and again. As the Guru
        is pleased, the Lord is obtained, and you shall not be pushed
        around any more. The Lord's humble servant becomes the Lord,
        Har, Har; O Nanak, the Lord and His servant are one and the same.
        || 4 || 9 || 16 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  The treasure of Ambrosial
        Nectar, the Lord's devotional service, is found through the
        Guru, the True Guru, O Lord King. The Guru, the True Guru, is
        the True Banker, who gives to His Sikh the capital of the Lord.
        Blessed, blessed is the trader and the trade; how wonderful is
        the Banker, the Guru! O servant Nanak, they alone obtain the Guru,
        who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their foreheads.
        || 1 ||   You are my True Banker, O Lord; the whole world is
        Your trader, O Lord King. You fashioned all vessels, O Lord, and
        that which dwells within is also Yours. Whatever You place in
        that vessel, that alone comes out again. </p>

      <p> What can the poor creatures do? The Lord has given the treasure
        of His devotional worship to servant Nanak.  || 2 ||   What Glorious
        Virtues of Yours can I describe, O Lord and Master? You are the
        most infinite of the infinite, O Lord King. I praise the Lord's
        Name, day and night; this alone is my hope and support. I am a
        fool, and I know nothing. How can I find Your limits? Servant
        Nanak is the slave of the Lord, the water-carrier of the slaves
        of the Lord.  || 3 ||   As it pleases You, You save me; I have
        come seeking Your Sanctuary, O God, O Lord King. I am wandering
        around, ruining myself day and night; O Lord, please save my honor!
        I am just a child; You, O Guru, are my father. Please give me
        understanding and instruction. Servant Nanak is known as the Lord's
        slave; O Lord, please preserve his honor!  || 4 || 10 || 17 ||
        AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  Those who have the blessed pre-ordained
        destiny of the Lord written on their foreheads, meet the True
        Guru, the Lord King. The Guru removes the darkness of ignorance,
        and spiritual wisdom illuminates their hearts. They find the wealth
        of the jewel of the Lord, and then, they do not wander any longer.
        Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and
        in meditation, he meets the Lord.  || 1 ||   Those who have not
        kept the Lord's Name in their consciousness  -  why did
        they bother to come into the world, O Lord King? It is so difficult
        to obtain this human incarnation, and without the Naam, it is
        all futile and useless. Now, in this most fortunate season, he
        does not plant the seed of the Lord's Name; what will the
        hungry soul eat, in the world hereafter? The self-willed manmukhs
        are born again and again. O Nanak, such is the Lord's Will.
        || 2 ||   You, O Lord, belong to all, and all belong to You.
        You created all, O Lord King. Nothing is in anyone's hands;
        all walk as You cause them to walk. They alone are united with
        You, O Beloved, whom You cause to be so united; they alone are
        pleasing to Your Mind. Servant Nanak has met the True Guru, and
        through the Lord's Name, he has been carried across.  ||
        3 ||   Some sing of the Lord, through musical Ragas and the sound
        current of the Naad, through the Vedas, and in so many ways. But
        the Lord, Har, Har, is not pleased by these, O Lord King. Those
        who are filled with fraud and corruption within  -  what good
        does it do for them to cry out? The Creator Lord knows everything,
        although they may try to hide their sins and the causes of their
        diseases. O Nanak, those Gurmukhs whose hearts are pure, obtain
        the Lord, Har, Har, by devotional worship.  || 4 || 11 || 18 ||
        AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  Those whose hearts are filled with the
        love of the Lord, Har, Har, are the wisest and most clever people,
        O Lord King. Even if they misspeak outwardly, they are still very
        pleasing to the Lord. The Lord's Saints have no other place.
        The Lord is the honor of the dishonored. The Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, is the Royal Court for servant Nanak; the Lord's
        power is his only power.  || 1 ||   Wherever my True Guru goes
        and sits, that place is beautiful, O Lord King. The Guru's
        Sikhs seek out that place; they take the dust and apply it to
        their faces. The works of the Guru's Sikhs, who meditate
        on the Lord's Name, are approved. Those who worship the True
        Guru, O Nanak  -  the Lord causes them to be worshipped in
        turn.  || 2 ||   The Guru's Sikh keeps the Love of the Lord,
        and the Name of the Lord, in his mind. </p>

      <p> He loves You, O Lord, O Lord King. He serves the Perfect True
        Guru, and his hunger and self-conceit are eliminated. The hunger
        of the Gursikh is totally eliminated; indeed, many others are
        satisfied through them. Servant Nanak has planted the Seed of
        the Lord's Goodness; this Goodness of the Lord shall never
        be exhausted.  || 3 ||   The minds of the Gursikhs rejoice, because
        they have seen my True Guru, O Lord King. If someone recites to
        them the story of the Lord's Name, it seems so sweet to the
        mind of those Gursikhs. The Gursikhs are robed in honor in the
        Court of the Lord; my True Guru is very pleased with them. Servant
        Nanak has become the Lord, Har, Har; the Lord, Har, Har, abides
        within his mind.  || 4 || 12 || 19 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL: 
        Those who meet my Perfect True Guru  -  He implants within
        them the Name of the Lord, the Lord King. Those who meditate on
        the Lord's Name have all of their desire and hunger removed.
        Those who meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har  -  the
        Messenger of Death cannot even approach them. O Lord, shower Your
        Mercy upon servant Nanak, that he may ever chant the Name of the
        Lord; through the Name of the Lord, he is saved.  || 1 ||   Those
        who, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Naam, meet no obstacles in their
        path, O Lord King. Those who are pleasing to the almighty True
        Guru are worshipped by everyone. Those who serve their Beloved
        True Guru obtain eternal peace. Those who meet the True Guru,
        O Nanak  -  the Lord Himself meets them.  || 2 ||   Those Gurmukhs,
        who are filled with His Love, have the Lord as their Saving Grace,
        O Lord King. How can anyone slander them? The Lord's Name
        is dear to them. Those whose minds are in harmony with the Lord
        -  all their enemies attack them in vain. Servant Nanak meditates
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Lord Protector.  || 3 ||
        In each and every age, He creates His devotees and preserves
        their honor, O Lord King. The Lord killed the wicked Harnaakhash,
        and saved Prahlaad. He turned his back on the egotists and slanderers,
        and showed His Face to Naam Dayv. Servant Nanak has so served
        the Lord, that He will deliver him in the end.  || 4 || 13 ||

        I have tasted the sweet essence of the Lord. The sweet essence
        of the Lord has rained down in my mind; by the pleasure of the
        True Guru, I have attained peaceful ease. I have come to dwell
        in the home of my own self, and I sing the songs of joy; the five
        villains have fled. I am soothed and satisfied with the Ambrosial
        Bani of His Word; the friendly Saint is my advocate. Says Nanak,
        my mind is in harmony with the Lord; I have seen God with my eyes.
        || 1 ||   Adorned  -  adorned are my beauteous gates, O Lord.
        Guests  -  my guests are the Beloved Saints, O Lord. The Beloved
        Saints have resolved my affairs; I humbly bowed to them, and committed
        myself to their service. He Himself is the groom's party,
        and He Himself the bride's party; He Himself is the Lord
        and Master; He Himself is the Divine Lord. He Himself resolves
        His own affairs; He Himself sustains the Universe. Says Nanak,
        my Bridegroom is sitting in my home; the gates of my body are
        beautifully adorned.  || 2 ||   The nine treasures  -  the
        nine treasures come into my home, Lord. Everything  -  I obtain
        everything, meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Meditating
        on the Naam, the Lord of the Universe becomes the one's eternal
        companion, and he dwells in peaceful ease. His calculations are
        ended, his wanderings cease, and his mind is no longer afflicted
        with anxiety. When the Lord of the Universe reveals Himself, and
        the unstruck melody of the sound current vibrates, the drama of
        wondrous splendor is enacted. Says Nanak, when my Husband Lord

        Har, Har, the walls of the fortress of doubt have been destroyed.
        I have obtained the wealth of so many treasures; the Lord Himself
        has stood by my side. He is the man of spiritual wisdom, and he
        is the leader, whom God has made His own. Says Nanak, when the

        emotional attachment, corruption and duality, their light merges

        -  the Lord's Saints are my friends, my best friends
        and helpers. By great good fortune, by great good fortune, I have
        obtained the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. By great good
        fortune, I obtained it, and I meditate on the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord; my pains and sufferings have been taken away. I have
        grasped the Guru's Feet, and my doubts and fears are gone.
        He Himself has erased my self-conceit. Granting His Grace, God
        has united me with Himself; no longer do I suffer the pains of
        separation, and I shall not have to go anywhere. Prays Nanak,
        I am forever Your slave, Lord; I seek Your Sanctuary.  || 2 ||

        humbly bow to them; meeting them, I know God. The Perfect and
        All-powerful Lord, the Architect of Destiny, is contained in each
        and every heart, everywhere. Meeting the Perfect Guru, we meditate
        on the Naam, and do not lose this life in the gamble. Prays Nanak,
        I seek Your Sanctuary; please, shower Your Mercy upon me, and
        protect me.  || 3 ||   Innumerable  -  innumerable are Your
        Glorious Virtues; how many of them can I sing? The dust of Your

        the Transcendent Lord God is ever-present, always with us. Suffering
        departs, and there is peace; singing the Kirtan of the Lord's

        treasure, children, siblings and friends. The absolute Lord, the
        Primal Being, is more beloved than all; His condition cannot be
        known. I shall never forget the Lord, for an instant, for a single
        breath; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I enjoy His
        Love. The Primal Lord God is the Life of the Universe; His Saints
        drink in the Lord's sublime essence. Meditating on Him, doubts,

        like this, give your heart to the Beloved Lord. Give your heart
        to your Beloved Lord, and enjoy His bed, and enjoy all pleasure

        deep crimson color of His Love; after such a long time, I have
        met my Friend. When the Guru became my advocate, then I saw the
        Lord with my eyes. No one else looks like my Beloved Husband Lord.

        the Saints is the way to salvation. Prays Nanak, I meditate on
        the Lord's lotus feet, and grasp the protection of the Lord
        of the Universe, the merciful, the ocean of kindness.  || 3 ||
        The Lord is the Lover of His devotees; this is His natural way.
        Wherever the Saints worship the Lord in adoration, there He is
        revealed. God blends Himself with His devotees in His natural
        way, and resolves their affairs. <br>
