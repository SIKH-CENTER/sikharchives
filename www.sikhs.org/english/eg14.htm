        RAAG GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIRST MEHL,  CHAU-PADAS &amp; DU-PADAS:
        <p> <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD. </b> </p>
        <p> <b>TRUTH IS THE NAME. </b> </p>
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  NO FEAR.  NO HATRED. </p>
        <p> IMAGE OF THE UNDYING.  BEYOND BIRTH.  SELF-EXISTENT. </p>
        <p> BY GURU'S GRACE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The Fear of God is overpowering, and so very heavy, while the
        intellect is lightweight, as is the speech one speaks. So place
        the Fear of God upon your head, and bear that weight; by the Grace
        of the Merciful Lord, contemplate the Guru.  || 1 ||   Without
        the Fear of God, no one crosses over the world-ocean. This Fear
        of God adorns the Love of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        fire of fear within the body is burnt away by the Fear of God.
        Through this Fear of God, we are adorned with the Word of the
        Shabad. Without the Fear of God, all that is fashioned is false.
        Useless is the mold, and useless are the hammer-strokes on the
        mold.  || 2 ||   The desire for the worldly drama arises in the
        intellect, but even with thousands of clever mental tricks, the
        heat of the Fear of God does not come into play. O Nanak, the
        speech of the self-willed manmukh is just wind. His words are
        worthless and empty, like the wind.  || 3 || 1 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  Place the Fear of God within the home of your heart; with
        this Fear of God in your heart, all other fears shall be frightened
        away. What sort of fear is that, which frightens other fears?
        Without You, I have other place of rest at all. Whatever happens
        is all according to Your Will.  || 1 ||   Be afraid, if you have
        any fear, other than the Fear of God. Afraid of fear, and living
        in fear, the mind is held in tumult.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        soul does not die; it does not drown, and it does not swim across.
        The One who created everything does everything. By the Hukam of
        His Command we come, and by the Hukam of His Command we go. Before
        and after, His Command is pervading.  || 2 ||   Cruelty, attachment,
        desire and egotism  -  there is great hunger in these, like
        the raging torrent of a wild stream. Let the Fear of God be your
        food, drink and support. Without doing this, the fools simply
        die.  || 3 ||   If anyone really has anyone else  -  how rare
        is that person! All are Yours  -  You are the Lord of all.
        All beings and creatures, wealth and property belong to Him. O
        Nanak, it is so difficult to describe and contemplate Him.  ||
        4 || 2 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST MEHL:  Let wisdom be your mother, and
        contentment your father. Let Truth be your brother  -  these
        are your best relatives.  || 1 ||   He has been described, but
        He cannot be described at all. </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Your All-pervading creative nature cannot be estimated.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Modesty, humility and intuitive understanding
        are my mother-in-law and father-in-law; I have made good deeds
        my spouse.  || 2 ||   Union with the Holy is my wedding date,
        and separation from the world is my marriage. Says Nanak, Truth
        is the child born of this Union.  || 3 || 3 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  The union of air, water and fire  -  the body is the
        play-thing of the fickle and unsteady intellect. It has nine doors,
        and then there is the Tenth Gate. Reflect upon this and understand
        it, O wise one.  || 1 ||   The Lord is the One who speaks, teaches
        and listens. One who contemplates his own self is truly wise.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The body is dust; the wind speaks through
        it. Understand, O wise one, who has died. Awareness, conflict
        and ego have died, but the One who sees does not die.  || 2 ||
        For the sake of it, you journey to sacred shrines and holy rivers;
        but this priceless jewel is within your own heart. The Pandits,
        the religious scholars, read and read endlessly; they stir up
        arguments and controversies, but they do not know the secret deep
        within.  || 3 ||   I have not died  -  that evil nature within
        me has died. The One who is pervading everywhere does not die.
        Says Nanak, the Guru has revealed God to me, and now I see that
        there is no such thing as birth or death.  || 4 || 4 ||   GAUREE,
        FIRST MEHL,  DAKHANEE:  I am forever a sacrifice to the one who
        listens and hears, who understands and believes in the Name. When
        the Lord Himself leads us astray, there is no other place of rest
        for us to find. You impart understanding, and You unite us in
        Your Union.  || 1 ||   I obtain the Naam, which shall go along
        with me in the end. Without the Name, all are held in the grip
        of Death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My farming and my trading are
        by the Support of the Name. The seeds of sin and virtue are bound
        together. Sexual desire and anger are the wounds of the soul.
        The evil-minded ones forget the Naam, and then depart.  || 2 ||
        True are the Teachings of the True Guru. The body and mind are
        cooled and soothed, by the touchstone of Truth. This is the true
        mark of wisdom: that one remains detached, like the water-lily,
        or the lotus upon the water. Attuned to the Word of the Shabad,
        one becomes sweet, like the juice of the sugar cane.  || 3 ||
        By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, the castle of the body
        has ten gates. The five passions dwell there, together with the
        Divine Light of the Infinite. The Lord Himself is the merchandise,
        and He Himself is the trader. O Nanak, through the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, we are adorned and rejuvenated.  || 4 || 5 ||   GAUREE,
        FIRST MEHL:  How can we know where we came from? Where did we
        originate, and where will we go and merge? How are we bound, and
        how do we obtain liberation? How do we merge with intuitive ease
        into the Eternal, Imperishable Lord?  || 1 ||   With the Naam
        in the heart and the Ambrosial Naam on our lips, through the Name
        of the Lord, we rise above desire, like the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   With intuitive ease we come, and with intuitive ease we
        depart. From the mind we originate, and into the mind we are absorbed.
        As Gurmukh, we are liberated, and are not bound. Contemplating
        the Word of the Shabad, we are emancipated through the Name of
        the Lord.  || 2 ||   At night, lots of birds settle on the tree.
        Some are happy, and some are sad. Caught in the desires of the
        mind, they perish. And when the life-night comes to its end, then
        they look to the sky. They fly away in all ten directions, according
        to their pre-ordained destiny. </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>
          <b><a name="p153" id="p153">Page 153</a></b>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> || 3 ||   Those who are committed to the Naam, see the world as
        merely a temporary pasture. Sexual desire and anger are broken,
        like a jar of poison. Without the merchandise of the Name, the
        house of the body and the store of the mind are empty. Meeting
        the Guru, the hard and heavy doors are opened.  || 4 ||   One
        meets the Holy Saint only through perfect destiny. The Lord's
        perfect people rejoice in the Truth. Surrendering their minds
        and bodies, they find the Lord with intuitive ease. Nanak falls
        at their feet.  || 5 || 6 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST MEHL:  The conscious
        mind is engrossed in sexual desire, anger and Maya. The conscious
        mind is awake only to falsehood, corruption and attachment. It
        gathers in the assets of sin and greed. So swim across the river
        of life, O my mind, with the Sacred Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   Waaho! Waaho!  -  Great! Great is my True Lord!
        I seek Your All-powerful Support. I am a sinner  -  You alone
        are pure.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Fire and water join together,
        and the breath roars in its fury! The tongue and the sex organs
        each seek to taste. The eyes which look upon corruption do not
        know the Love and the Fear of God. Conquering self-conceit, one
        obtains the Name.  || 2 ||   One who dies in the Word of the Shabad,
        shall never again have to die. Without such a death, how can one
        attain perfection? The mind is engrossed in deception, treachery
        and duality. Whatever the Immortal Lord does, comes to pass. 
        || 3 ||   So get aboard that boat when your turn comes. Those
        who fail to embark upon that boat shall be beaten in the Court
        of the Lord. Blessed is that Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, where
        the Praises of the True Lord are sung. O Nanak, the One Creator
        Lord is pervading hearth and home.  || 4 || 7 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  The inverted heart-lotus has been turned upright, through
        reflective meditation on God. From the Sky of the Tenth Gate,
        the Ambrosial Nectar trickles down. The Lord Himself is pervading
        the three worlds.  || 1 ||   O my mind, do not give in to doubt.
        When the mind surrenders to the Name, it drinks in the essence
        of Ambrosial Nectar.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So win the game of
        life; let your mind surrender and accept death. When the self
        dies, the individual mind comes to know the Supreme Mind. As the
        inner vision is awakened, one comes to know one's own home,
        deep within the self.  || 2 ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is austerity, chastity and cleansing baths at sacred shrines of
        pilgrimage. What good are ostentatious displays? The All-pervading
        Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.  || 3 ||   If
        I had faith in someone else, then I would go to that one's
        house. But where should I go, to beg? There is no other place
        for me. O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, I am intuitively
        absorbed in the Lord.  || 4 || 8 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST MEHL:  Meeting
        the True Guru, we are shown the way to die. Remaining alive in
        this death brings joy deep within. Overcoming egotistical pride,
        the Tenth Gate is found.  || 1 ||   Death is pre-ordained  - 
        no one who comes can remain here. So chant and meditate on the
        Lord, and remain in the Sanctuary of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Meeting the True Guru, duality is dispelled. The heart-lotus
        blossoms forth, and the mind is attached to the Lord God. One
        who remains dead while yet alive obtains the greatest happiness
        hereafter.  || 2 ||   Meeting the True Guru, one becomes truthful,
        chaste and pure. Climbing up the steps of the Guru's Path,
        one becomes the highest of the high. When the Lord grants His
        Mercy, the fear of death is conquered.  || 3 ||   Uniting in Guru's
        Union, we are absorbed in His Loving Embrace. Granting His Grace,
        He reveals the Mansion of His Presence, within the home of the
        self. O Nanak, conquering egotism, we are absorbed into the Lord.

      <p> GAUREE,  FIRST MEHL:  Past actions cannot be erased. What do we
        know of what will happen hereafter? Whatever pleases Him shall
        come to pass. There is no other Doer except Him.  || 1 ||   I
        do not know about karma, or how great Your gifts are. The karma
        of actions, the Dharma of righteousness, social class and status,
        are contained within Your Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are
        So Great, O Giver, O Great Giver! The treasure of Your devotional
        worship is never exhausted. One who takes pride in himself shall
        never be right. The soul and body are all at Your disposal.  ||
        2 ||   You kill and rejuvenate. You forgive and merge us into
        Yourself. As it pleases You, You inspire us to chant Your Name.
        You are All-knowing, All-seeing and True, O my Supreme Lord. Please,
        bless me with the Guru's Teachings; my faith is in You alone.
        || 3 ||   One whose mind is attuned to the Lord, has no pollution
        in his body. Through the Guru's Word, the True Shabad is
        realized. All Power is Yours, through the greatness of Your Name.
        Nanak abides in the Sanctuary of Your devotees.  || 4 || 10 ||
        GAUREE,  FIRST MEHL: Those who speak the Unspoken, drink in
        the Nectar. Other fears are forgotten, and they are absorbed into
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Why should we fear,
        when fear is dispelled by the Fear of God? Through the Shabad,
        the Word of the Perfect Guru, I recognize God.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord's essence
        are blessed and acclaimed, and intuitively absorbed into the Lord.
        || 2 ||   Those whom the Lord puts to sleep, evening and morning
        -  those self-willed manmukhs are bound and gagged by Death,
        here and hereafter.  || 3 ||   Those whose hearts are filled with
        the Lord, day and night, are perfect. O Nanak, they merge into
        the Lord, and their doubts are cast away.  || 4 || 11 ||   GAUREE,
        FIRST MEHL:  One who loves the three qualities is subject to
        birth and death. The four Vedas speak only of the visible forms.
        They describe and explain the three states of mind, but the fourth
        state, union with the Lord, is known only through the True Guru.
        || 1 ||   Through devotional worship of the Lord, and service
        to the Guru, one swims across. Then, one is not born again, and
        is not subject to death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Everyone speaks
        of the four great blessings; the Simritees, the Shaastras and
        the Pandits speak of them as well. But without the Guru, they
        do not understand their true significance. The treasure of liberation
        is obtained through devotional worship of the Lord.  || 2 || 
        Those, within whose hearts the Lord dwells, become Gurmukh; they
        receive the blessings of devotional worship. Through devotional
        worship of the Lord, liberation and bliss are obtained. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, supreme ecstasy is obtained.  || 3
        ||   One who meets the Guru, beholds Him, and inspires others
        to behold Him as well. In the midst of hope, the Guru teaches
        us to live above hope and desire. He is the Master of the meek,
        the Giver of peace to all. Nanak's mind is imbued with the
        Lotus Feet of the Lord.  || 4 || 12 ||   GAUREE CHAYTEE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  With your nectar-like body, you live in comfort, but this
        world is just a passing drama. You practice greed, avarice and
        great falsehood, and you carry such a heavy burden. O body, I
        have seen you blowing away like dust on the earth.  || 1 ||  
        Listen  -  listen to my advice! Only the good deeds which you
        have done shall remain with you, O my soul. </p>
      <p>
        <center>

          <b><a name="p155" id="p155">Page 155</a></b>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> This opportunity shall not come again!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I
        say to you, O my body: listen to my advice! You slander, and then
        praise others; you indulge in lies and gossip. You gaze upon the
        wives of others, O my soul; you steal and commit evil deeds. But
        when the swan departs, you shall remain behind, like an abandoned
        woman.  || 2 ||   O body, you are living in a dream! What good
        deeds have you done? When I stole something by deception, then
        my mind was pleased. I have no honor in this world, and I shall
        find no shelter in the world hereafter. My life has been lost,
        wasted in vain!  || 3 ||   I am totally miserable! O Baba Nanak,
        no one cares for me at all!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Turkish horses,
        gold, silver and loads of gorgeous clothes  -  none of these
        shall go with you, O Nanak. They are lost and left behind, you
        fool! I have tasted all the sugar candy and sweets, but Your Name
        alone is Ambrosial Nectar.  || 4 ||   Digging deep foundations,
        the walls are constructed, but in the end, the buildings return
        to heaps of dust. People gather and hoard their possessions, and
        give nothing to anyone else  -  the poor fools think that everything
        is theirs. Riches do not remain with anyone  -  not even the
        golden palaces of Sri Lanka.  || 5 ||   Listen, you foolish and
        ignorant mind  -  only His Will prevails.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   My Banker is the Great Lord and Master. I am only His petty
        merchant. This soul and body all are His. He Himself kills, and
        brings back to life.  || 6 || 1 || 13 ||   GAUREE CHAYTEE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  There are five of them, but I am all alone. How can I protect
        my hearth and home, O my mind? They are beating and plundering
        me over and over again; unto whom can I complain?  || 1 ||   Chant
        the Name of the Supreme Lord, O my mind. Otherwise, in the world
        hereafter, you will have to face the awesome and cruel army of
        Death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God has erected the temple of the
        body; He has placed the nine doors, and the soul-bride sits within.
        She enjoys the sweet play again and again, while the five demons
        are plundering her.  || 2 ||   In this way, the temple is being
        demolished; the body is being plundered, and the soul-bride, left
        all alone, is captured. Death strikes her down with his rod, the
        shackles are placed around her neck, and now the five have left.
        || 3 ||   The wife yearns for gold and silver, and her friends,
        the senses, yearn for good food. O Nanak, she commits sins for
        their sake; she shall go, bound and gagged, to the City of Death.
        || 4 || 2 || 14 ||   GAUREE CHAYTEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Let your ear-rings
        be those ear-rings which pierce deep within your heart. Let your
        body be your patched coat. Let the five passions be disciples
        under your control, O begging Yogi, and make this mind your walking
        stick.  || 1 ||   Thus you shall find the Way of Yoga. There is
        only the One Word of the Shabad; everything else shall pass away.
        Let this be the fruits and roots of your mind's diet.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Some try to find the Guru by shaving their heads
        at the Ganges, but I have made the Guru my Ganges. The Saving
        Grace of the three worlds is the One Lord and Master, but those
        in darkness do not remember Him.  || 2 ||   Practicing hypocrisy
        and attaching your mind to worldly objects, your doubt shall never
        depart. </p>

        reason would you have to chase after greed?  || 3 ||   Meditate
        on the Immaculate Lord, and saturate your mind with Him. Why,
        O Yogi, do you make so many false and deceptive claims?  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The body is wild, and the mind is foolish. Practicing
        egotism, selfishness and conceit, your life is passing away. Prays
        Nanak, when the naked body is cremated, then you will come to
        regret and repent.  || 4 || 3 || 15 ||   GAUREE CHAYTEE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  O mind, there is only the One medicine, mantra and healing
        herb  -  center your consciousness firmly on the One Lord.
        Take to the Lord, the Destroyer of the sins and karma of past
        incarnations.  || 1 ||   The One Lord and Master is pleasing to
        my mind. In Your three qualities, the world is engrossed; the
        Unknowable cannot be known.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Maya is so sweet
        to the body, like sugar or molasses. We all carry loads of it.
        In the dark of the night, nothing can be seen. The mouse of death
        is gnawing away at the rope of life, O Siblings of Destiny!  ||
        2 ||   As the self-willed manmukhs act, they suffer in pain. The
        Gurmukh obtains honor and greatness. Whatever He does, that alone
        happens; past actions cannot be erased.  || 3 ||   Those who are
        imbued with, and committed to the Lord's Love, are filled
        to overflowing; they never lack anything. If Nanak could be the
        dust of their feet, then he, the ignorant one, might also obtain
        some.  || 4 || 4 || 16 ||   GAUREE CHAYTEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Who
        is our mother, and who is our father? Where did we come from?
        We are formed from the fire of the womb within, and the bubble
        of water of the sperm. For what purpose are we created?  || 1
        ||   O my Master, who can know Your Glorious Virtues? My own demerits
        cannot be counted.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I took the form of so
        many plants and trees, and so many animals. Many times I entered
        the families of snakes and flying birds.  || 2 ||   I broke into
        the shops of the city and well-guarded palaces; stealing from
        them, I snuck home again. I looked in front of me, and I looked
        behind me, but where could I hide from You?  || 3 ||   I saw the
        banks of sacred rivers, the nine continents, the shops and bazaars
        of the cities. Taking the scale, the merchant begins to weigh
        his actions within his own heart.  || 4 ||   As the seas and the
        oceans are overflowing with water, so vast are my own sins. Please,
        shower me with Your Mercy, and take pity upon me. I am a sinking
        stone  -  please carry me across!  || 5 ||   My soul is burning
        like fire, and the knife is cutting deep. Prays Nanak, recognizing
        the Lord's Command, I am at peace, day and night.  || 6 ||
        5 || 17 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FIRST MEHL:  The nights are wasted
        sleeping, and the days are wasted eating. Human life is such a
        precious jewel, but it is being lost in exchange for a mere shell.
        || 1 ||   You do not know the Name of the Lord. You fool  - 
        you shall regret and repent in the end!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        You bury your temporary wealth in the ground, but how can you
        love that which is temporary? Those who have departed, after craving
        for temporary wealth, have returned home without this temporary
        wealth.  || 2 ||   If people could gather it in by their own efforts,
        then everyone would be so lucky. </p>

      <p> According to the karma of past actions, one's destiny unfolds,
        even though everyone wants to be so lucky.  || 3 ||   O Nanak,
        the One who created the creation  -  He alone takes care of
        it. The Hukam of our Lord and Master's Command cannot be
        known; He Himself blesses us with greatness.  || 4 || 1 || 18
        ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FIRST MEHL:  What if I were to become
        a deer, and live in the forest, picking and eating fruits and
        roots  -  by Guru's Grace, I am a sacrifice to my Master.
        Again and again, I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice.  || 1 ||   I am
        the shop-keeper of the Lord. Your Name is my merchandise and trade.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If I were to become a cuckoo, living in
        a mango tree, I would still contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
        I would still meet my Lord and Master, with intuitive ease; the
        Darshan, the Blessed Vision of His Form, is incomparably beautiful.
        || 2 ||   If I were to become a fish, living in the water, I
        would still remember the Lord, who watches over all beings and
        creatures. My Husband Lord dwells on this shore, and on the shore
        beyond; I would still meet Him, and hug Him close in my embrace.
        || 3 ||   If I were to become a snake, living in the ground,
        the Shabad would still dwell in my mind, and my fears would be
        dispelled. O Nanak, they are forever the happy soul-brides, whose
        light merges into His Light.  || 4 || 2 || 19 || </p>

      <p> In that house where the Praises of the Creator are chanted  - 
        in that house, sing the Songs of Praise, and meditate in remembrance
        on the Creator Lord.  || 1 ||   Sing the Songs of Praise of my
        Fearless Lord. I am a sacrifice to that Song of Praise which brings
        eternal peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Day after day, He cares for
        His beings; the Great Giver watches over all. Your gifts cannot
        be appraised; how can anyone compare to the Giver?  || 2 ||  
        The day of my wedding is pre-ordained. Come  -  let's
        gather together and pour the oil over the threshold. My friends,
        give me your blessings, that I may merge with my Lord and Master.
        || 3 ||   Unto each and every home, into each and every heart,
        this summons is sent out; the call comes each and every day. Remember
        in meditation the One who summons us; O Nanak, that day is drawing

        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Meeting the Guru, we meet the Lord. He Himself unites us in His
        Union. My God knows all His Own Ways. By the Hukam of His Command,
        He unites those who recognize the Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||
        By the Fear of the True Guru, doubt and fear are dispelled.
        Imbued with His Fear, we are absorbed in the Love of the True
        One.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meeting the Guru, the Lord naturally
        dwells within the mind. My God is Great and Almighty; His value
        cannot be estimated. Through the Shabad, I praise Him; He has
        no end or limitations. My God is the Forgiver. I pray that He
        may forgive me.  || 2 || </p>

      </p>
      <p> Meeting the Guru, all wisdom and understanding are obtained. The
        mind becomes pure, when the True Lord dwells within. When one
        dwells in Truth, all actions become true. The ultimate action
        is to contemplate the Word of the Shabad.  || 3 ||   Through the
        Guru, true service is performed. How rare is that Gurmukh who
        recognizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Giver, the Great
        Giver, lives forever. Nanak enshrines love for the Name of the
        Lord.  || 4 || 1 || 21 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  THIRD MEHL:  Those
        who obtain spiritual wisdom from the Guru are very rare. Those
        who obtain this understanding from the Guru become acceptable.
        Through the Guru, we intuitively contemplate the True One. Through
        the Guru, the Gate of Liberation is found.  || 1 ||   Through
        perfect good destiny, we come to meet the Guru. The true ones
        are intuitively absorbed in the True Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Meeting the Guru, the fire of desire is quenched. Through the
        Guru, peace and tranquility come to dwell within the mind. Through
        the Guru, we become pure, holy and true. Through the Guru, we
        are absorbed in the Word of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   Without the
        Guru, everyone wanders in doubt. Without the Name, they suffer
        in terrible pain. Those who meditate on the Naam become Gurmukh.
        True honor is obtained through the Darshan, the Blessed Vision
        of the True Lord.  || 3 ||   Why speak of any other? He alone
        is the Giver. When He grants His Grace, union with the Shabad
        is obtained. Meeting with my Beloved, I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the True Lord. O Nanak, becoming true, I am absorbed in the
        True One.  || 4 || 2 || 22 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  THIRD MEHL:
        True is that place, where the mind becomes pure. True is the
        one who abides in Truth. The True Bani of the Word is known throughout
        the four ages. The True One Himself is everything.  || 1 ||  
        Through the karma of good actions, one joins the Sat Sangat, the
        True Congregation. Sing the Glories of the Lord, sitting in that
        place.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Burn this tongue, which loves duality,
        which does not taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and which
        utters insipid words. Without understanding, the body and mind
        become tasteless and insipid. Without the Name, the miserable
        ones depart crying out in pain.  || 2 ||   One whose tongue naturally
        and intuitively tastes the Lord's sublime essence, by Guru's
        Grace, is absorbed in the True Lord. Imbued with Truth, one contemplates
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and drinks in the Ambrosial
        Nectar, from the immaculate stream within.  || 3 ||   The Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, is collected in the vessel of the mind.
        Nothing is collected if the vessel is upside-down. Through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Naam abides within the mind.
        O Nanak, True is that vessel of the mind, which thirsts for the
        Shabad.  || 4 || 3 || 23 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  THIRD MEHL:
        Some sing on and on, but their minds do not find happiness. In
        egotism, they sing, but it is wasted uselessly. Those who love
        the Naam, sing the song. They contemplate the True Bani of the
        Word, and the Shabad.  || 1 ||   They sing on and on, if it pleases
        the True Guru. Their minds and bodies are embellished and adorned,
        attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Some sing, and some perform devotional worship. Without heart-felt
        love, the Naam is not obtained. True devotional worship consists
        of love for the Word of the Guru's Shabad. </p>

      <p> The devotee keeps his Beloved clasped tightly to his heart.  ||
        2 ||   The fools perform devotional worship by showing off; they
        dance and dance and jump all around, but they only suffer in terrible
        pain. By dancing and jumping, devotional worship is not performed.
        But one who dies in the Word of the Shabad, obtains devotional
        worship.  || 3 ||   The Lord is the Lover of His devotees; He
        inspires them to perform devotional worship. True devotional worship
        consists of eliminating selfishness and conceit from within. My
        True God knows all ways and means. O Nanak, He forgives those
        who recognize the Naam.  || 4 || 4 || 24 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,
        THIRD MEHL:  When someone kills and subdues his own mind, his
        wandering nature is also subdued. Without such a death, how can
        one find the Lord? Only a few know the medicine to kill the mind.
        One whose mind dies in the Word of the Shabad, understands Him.
        || 1 ||   He grants greatness to those whom He forgives. By Guru's
        Grace, the Lord comes to dwell within the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Gurmukh practices doing good deeds; thus he comes to
        understand this mind. The mind is like an elephant, drunk with
        wine. The Guru is the rod which controls it, and shows it the
        way.  || 2 ||   The mind is uncontrollable; how rare are those
        who subdue it. Those who move the immovable become pure. The Gurmukhs
        embellish and beautify this mind. They eradicate egotism and corruption
        from within.  || 3 ||   Those who, by pre-ordained destiny, are
        united in the Lord's Union, are never separated from Him
        again; they are absorbed in the Shabad. He Himself knows His Own
        Almighty Power. O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 4 || 5 || 25 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  THIRD MEHL:
        The entire world has gone insane in egotism. In the love of duality,
        it wanders deluded by doubt. The mind is distracted by great anxiety;
        no one recognizes one's own self. Occupied with their own
        affairs, their nights and days are passing away.  || 1 ||   Meditate
        on the Lord in your hearts, O my Siblings of Destiny. The Gurmukh's
        tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Gurmukhs recognize the Lord in their own hearts; they
        serve the Lord, the Life of the World. They are famous throughout
        the four ages. They subdue egotism, and realize the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad. God, the Architect of Destiny, showers His
        Mercy upon them.  || 2 ||   True are those who merge into the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad; they restrain their wandering
        mind and keep it steady. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the
        nine treasures. It is obtained from the Guru. By the Lord's
        Grace, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind.  || 3 ||   Chanting
        the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, the body becomes peaceful and
        tranquil. He dwells deep within  -  the pain of death does
        not touch Him. He Himself is our Lord and Master; He is His Own
        Advisor. O Nanak, serve the Lord forever; He is the treasure of
        glorious virtue.  || 4 || 6 || 26 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Why forget Him, unto whom the soul and the breath of life
        belong? Why forget Him, who is all-pervading? Serving Him, one
        is honored and accepted in the Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||   I
        am a sacrifice to the Name of the Lord. If I were to forget You,
        at that very instant, I would die.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those
        whom You Yourself have led astray, forget You. </p>

        manmukhs are consigned to reincarnation.  || 2 ||   Those who
        are pleasing to the One Lord enshrine the Lord within their minds.
        Through the Guru's Teachings, they are absorbed in the Lord's
        Name.  || 3 ||   Those who have virtue as their treasure, contemplate
        spiritual wisdom. Those who have virtue as their treasure, subdue
        egotism. Nanak is a sacrifice to those who are attuned to the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 7 || 27 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,
        THIRD MEHL:  You are Indescribable; how can I describe You? Those
        who subdue their minds, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        are absorbed in You. Your Glorious Virtues are countless; their
        value cannot be estimated.  || 1 ||   The Word of His Bani belongs
        to Him; in Him, it is diffused. Your Speech cannot be spoken;
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is chanted.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Where the True Guru is  -  there is the Sat
        Sangat, the True Congregation. Where the True Guru is  -  there,
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord are intuitively sung. Where the
        True Guru is  -  there egotism is burnt away, through the Word
        of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukhs serve Him; they obtain
        a place in the Mansion of His Presence. The Gurmukhs enshrine
        the Naam within the mind. The Gurmukhs worship the Lord, and are
        absorbed in the Naam.  || 3 ||   The Giver Himself gives His Gifts,
        as we enshrine love for the True Guru. Nanak celebrates those
        who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 8
        || 28 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  THIRD MEHL:  All forms and colors
        come from the One Lord. Air, water and fire are all kept together.
        The Lord God beholds the many and various colors.  || 1 ||   The
        One Lord is wondrous and amazing! He is the One, the One and Only.
        How rare is that Gurmukh who meditates on the Lord.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   God is naturally pervading all places. Sometimes He
        is hidden, and sometimes He is revealed; thus God has made the
        world of His making. He Himself wakes us from sleep.  || 2 ||
        No one can estimate His value, although everyone has tried,
        over and over again, to describe Him. Those who merge in the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, come to understand the Lord.  || 3
        ||   They listen to the Shabad continually; beholding Him, they
        merge into Him. They obtain glorious greatness by serving the
        Guru. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Name are absorbed
        in the Lord's Name.  || 4 || 9 || 29 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,
        THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukhs are asleep, in love and
        attachment to Maya. The Gurmukhs are awake, contemplating spiritual
        wisdom and the Glory of God. Those humble beings who love the
        Naam, are awake and aware.  || 1 ||   One who is awake to this
        intuitive wisdom does not fall asleep. How rare are those humble
        beings who understand this through the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The unsaintly blockhead shall never understand. He
        babbles on and on, but he is infatuated with Maya. Blind and ignorant,
        he shall never be reformed.  || 2 ||   In this age, salvation
        comes only from the Lord's Name. How rare are those who contemplate
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. They save themselves, and
        save all their family and ancestors as well.  || 3 || </p>

      <p> In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, no one is interested in good karma,
        or Dharmic faith. This Dark Age was born in the house of evil.
        O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one is liberated.
        || 4 || 10 || 30 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD MEHL,  GWAARAYREE:  True
        is the Lord King, True is His Royal Command. Those whose minds
        are attuned to the True, Carefree Lord enter the True Mansion
        of His Presence, and merge in the True Name.  || 1 ||   Listen,
        O my mind: contemplate the Word of the Shabad. Chant the Lord's
        Name, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   In doubt he comes, and in doubt he goes. This world is born
        out of the love of duality. The self-willed manmukh does not remember
        the Lord; he continues coming and going in reincarnation.  ||
        2 ||   Does he himself go astray, or does God lead him astray?
        This soul is enjoined to the service of someone else. It earns
        only terrible pain, and this life is lost in vain.  || 3 ||  
        Granting His Grace, He leads us to meet the True Guru. Remembering
        the One Name, doubt is cast out from within. O Nanak, chanting
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the nine treasures of the Name
        are obtained.  || 4 || 11 || 31 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Go and ask the Gurmukhs, who meditate on the Lord. Serving
        the Guru, the mind is satisfied. Those who earn the Lord's
        Name are wealthy. Through the Perfect Guru, understanding is obtained.
        || 1 ||   Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my Siblings
        of Destiny. The Gurmukhs serve the Lord, and so they are accepted.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who recognize the self  -  their
        minds become pure. They become Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet
        alive, and they find the Lord. Singing the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord, the intellect becomes pure and sublime, and they are
        easily and intuitively absorbed in the Lord.  || 2 ||   In the
        love of duality, no one can serve the Lord. In egotism and Maya,
        they are eating toxic poison. They are emotionally attached to
        their children, family and home. The blind, self-willed manmukhs
        come and go in reincarnation.  || 3 ||   Those, unto whom the
        Lord bestows His Name, worship Him night and day, through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad. How rare are those who understand
        the Guru's Teachings! O Nanak, they are absorbed in the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 12 || 32 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,
        THIRD MEHL:  The Guru's service has been performed throughout
        the four ages. Very few are those perfect ones who do this good
        deed. The wealth of the Lord's Name is inexhaustible; it
        shall never be exhausted. In this world, it brings a constant
        peace, and at the Lord's Gate, it brings honor.  || 1 ||
        O my mind, have no doubt about this. Those Gurmukhs who serve,
        drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who
        serve the True Guru are the greatest people of the world. They
        save themselves, and they redeem all their generations as well.
        They keep the Name of the Lord clasped tightly to their hearts.
        Attuned to the Naam, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
        || 2 ||   Serving the True Guru, the mind becomes humble forever.
        Egotism is subdued, and the heart-lotus blossoms forth. The Unstruck
        Melody vibrates, as they dwell within the home of the self. Attuned
        to the Naam, they remain detached within their own home.  || 3
        ||   Serving the True Guru, their words are true. Throughout the
        ages, the devotees chant and repeat these words. <br>
