      <p> Your servant is not afraid of anything; the Messenger of Death
        cannot even approach him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who are
        attuned to Your Love, O my Lord and Master, are released from
        the pains of birth and death. No one can erase Your Blessings;
        the True Guru has given me this assurance.  || 2 ||   Those who
        meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, obtain the fruits
        of peace. Twenty-four hours a day, they worship and adore You.
        In Your Sanctuary, with Your Support, they subdue the five villains.
        || 3 ||   I know nothing about wisdom, meditation and good deeds;
        I know nothing about Your excellence. Guru Nanak is the greatest
        of all; He saved my honor in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.  || 4
        || 10 || 57 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Renouncing everything,
        I have come to the Guru's Sanctuary; save me, O my Savior
        Lord! Whatever You link me to, to that I am linked; what can this
        poor creature do?  || 1 ||   O my Dear Lord God, You are the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts. Be Merciful to me, O Divine, Compassionate
        Guru, that I may constantly sing the Glorious Praises of my Lord
        and Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate
        on my God; by Guru's Grace, I cross over the terrifying
        world-ocean. Renouncing self-conceit, I have become the dust of
        all men's feet; in this way, I die, while I am still alive.
        || 2 ||   How fruitful is the life of that being in this world,
        who chants the Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
        All desires are fulfilled, for the one who is blessed with God's
        Kindness and Mercy.  || 3 ||   O Merciful to the meek, Kind and
        Compassionate Lord God, I seek Your Sanctuary. Take pity upon
        me, and bless me with Your Name. Nanak is the dust of the feet
        of the Holy.  || 4 || 11 || 58 || <br>

        for only a few days. Without the Name, the false woman is deluded
        by doubt and plundered by thieves. But those who are attuned to
        the True Lord, are not reincarnated again.  || 1 ||   How can
        one who is already dyed in the color of the Lord's Love,
        be colored any other color? So serve God the Dyer, and focus your
        consciousness on the True Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You wander
        around in the four directions, but without the good fortune of
        destiny, you shall never obtain wealth. If you are plundered by
        corruption and vice, you shall wander around, but like a fugitive,
        you shall find no place of rest. Only those who are protected
        by the Guru are saved; their minds are attuned to the Word of
        the Shabad.  || 2 ||   Those who wear white clothes, but have
        filthy and stone-hearted minds, may chant the Lord's Name
        with their mouths, but they are engrossed in duality; they are
        thieves. They do not understand their own roots; they are beasts.
        They are just animals!  || 3 ||   Constantly, continually, the
        mortal seeks pleasures. Constantly, continually, he begs for peace.
        But he does not think of the Creator Lord, and so he is overtaken
        by pain, again and again. But one, within whose mind the Giver
        of pleasure and pain dwells - how can his body feel any
        need?  || 4 ||   One who has a karmic debt to pay off is summoned,
        and the Messenger of Death smashes his head. When his account
        is called for, it has to be given. After it is reviewed, payment
        is demanded. Only love for the True One will save you; the Forgiver
        forgives.  || 5 ||   If you make any friend other than God, you
        shall die and mingle with the dust. Gazing upon the many games
        of love, you are beguiled and bewildered; you come and go in reincarnation.
        Only by God's Grace can you be saved. By His Grace, He
        unites in His Union.  || 6 ||   O careless one, you are totally
        lacking any wisdom; do not seek wisdom without the Guru. By indecision
        and inner conflict, you shall come to ruin. Good and bad both
        pull at you. Without being attuned to the Word of the Shabad and
        the Fear of God, all come under the gaze of the Messenger of Death.
        || 7 ||   He who created the creation and sustains it, gives
        sustenance to all. How can you forget Him from your mind? He is
        the Great Giver, forever and ever. Nanak shall never forget the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Support of the unsupported.  ||

      <p> One who praises the True Lord with his mind and body, pleases
        the Mind of the True Lord. Attuned to the Beloved Lord, the mind
        is appeased, and finds the Perfect Guru.  || 2 ||   I live, by
        cherishing Your Glorious Virtues; You dwell deep within me. You
        dwell within my mind, and so it naturally celebrates in joyful
        delight.  || 3 ||   O my foolish mind, how can I teach and instruct
        you? As Gurmukh, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and so
        become attuned to His Love.  || 4 ||   Continually, continuously,
        remember and cherish your Beloved Lord in your heart. For if you
        depart with virtue, then pain shall never afflict you.  || 5 ||
        The self-willed manmukh wanders around, deluded by doubt; he
        does not enshrine love for the Lord. He dies as a stranger to
        his own self, and his mind and body are spoiled.  || 6 ||   Performing
        service to the Guru, you shall go home with the profit. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Bani, and the Shabad, the Word of
        God, the state of Nirvaanaa is attained.  || 7 ||   Nanak makes
        this one prayer: if it pleases Your Will, bless me with a home
        in Your Name, Lord, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises.  ||
        8 || 1 || 3 ||   SOOHEE,  FIRST MEHL:  As iron is melted in the
        forge and re-shaped, so is the godless materialist reincarnated,
        and forced to wander aimlessly.  || 1 ||   Without understanding,
        everything is suffering, earning only more suffering. In his ego,
        he comes and goes, wandering in confusion, deluded by doubt. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You save those who are Gurmukh, O Lord, through
        meditation on Your Naam. You blend with Yourself, by Your Will,
        those who practice the Word of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   You created
        the Creation, and You Yourself gaze upon it; whatever You give,
        is received. You watch, establish and disestablish; You keep all
        in Your vision at Your Door.  || 3 ||   The body shall turn to
        dust, and the soul shall fly away. So where are their homes and
        resting places now? They do not find the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, either.  || 4 ||   In the pitch darkness of broad daylight,
        their wealth is being plundered. Pride is looting their homes
        like a thief; where can they file their complaint?  || 5 ||  
        The thief does not break into the home of the Gurmukh; he is awake
        in the Name of the Lord. The Word of the Shabad puts out the fire
        of desire; God's Light illuminates and enlightens.  ||
        6 ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a jewel, a ruby; the
        Guru has taught me the Word of the Shabad. One who follows the
        Guru's Teachings remains forever free of desire.  || 7
        ||   Night and day, enshrine the Lord's Name within your
        mind. Please unite Nanak in Union, O Lord, if it is pleasing to
        Your Will.  || 8 || 2 || 4 ||   SOOHEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Never forget
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, from your mind; night and day,
        meditate on it. As You keep me, in Your Merciful Grace, so do
        I find peace.  || 1 ||   I am blind, and the Lord's Name
        is my cane. I remain under the Sheltering Support of my Lord and
        Master; I am not enticed by Maya the enticer.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Wherever I look, there the Guru has shown me that God is
        always with me. Searching inwardly and outwardly as well, I came
        to see Him, through the Word of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   So serve
        the True Guru with love, through the Immaculate Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. As it pleases You, so by Your Will, You destroy my
        doubts and fears.  || 3 ||   At the very moment of birth, he is
        afflicted with pain, and in the end, he comes only to die. Birth
        and death are validated and approved, singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 4 ||   When there is no ego, there You are; You
        fashioned all of this. <br>

        is permeating and pervading; this is wonderful and amazing!  ||
        6 ||   You are not far away, God; You know everything. The Gurmukh

      <p> <font color="#000000">Everything comes from the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord; without the True Guru, the Naam is not experienced.
        The Word of the Guru's Shabad is the sweetest and most
        sublime essence, but without tasting it, its flavor cannot be
        experienced. He wastes this human life in exchange for a mere
        shell; he does not understand his own self. But, if he becomes
        Gurmukh, then he comes to know the One Lord, and the disease of
        egotism does not afflict him.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to my
        Guru, who has lovingly attached me to the True Lord. Concentrating
        on the Word of the Shabad, the soul is illumined and enlightened.
        I remain absorbed in celestial ecstasy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        The Gurmukh sings the Praises of the Lord; the Gurmukh understands.
        The Gurmukh contemplates the Word of the Shabad. Body and soul
        are totally rejuvenated through the Guru; the Gurmukh's
        affairs are resolved in his favor. The blind self-willed manmukh
        acts blindly, and earns only poison in this world. Enticed by
        Maya, he suffers in constant pain, without the most Beloved Guru.
        || 2 ||   He alone is a selfless servant, who serves the True
        Guru, and walks in harmony with the True Guru's Will. The
        True Shabad, the Word of God, is the True Praise of God; enshrine
        the True Lord within your mind. The Gurmukh speaks the True Word
        of Gurbani, and egotism departs from within. He Himself is the
        Giver, and True are His actions. He proclaims the True Word of
        the Shabad.  || 3 ||   The Gurmukh works, and the Gurmukh earns;
        the Gurmukh inspires others to chant the Naam. He is forever unattached,
        imbued with the Love of the True Lord, intuitively in harmony
        with the Guru. The self-willed manmukh always tells lies; he plants
        the seeds of poison, and eats only poison. He is bound and gagged
        by the Messenger of Death, and burnt in the fire of desire; who
        can save him, except the Guru?  || 4 ||   True is that place of
        pilgrimage, where one bathes in the pool of Truth, and achieves
        self-realization as Gurmukh. The Gurmukh understands his own self.
        The Lord has shown that the Word of the Guru's Shabad is
        the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage; bathing in it, filth
        is washed away. True and Immaculate is the True Word of His Shabad;
        no filth touches or clings to Him. True Praise, True Devotional
        Praise, is obtained from the Perfect Guru.  || 5 ||   Body, mind,
        everything belongs to the Lord; but the evil-minded ones cannot
        even say this. If such is the Hukam of the Lord's Command,
        then one becomes pure and spotless, and the ego is taken away
        from within. I have intuitively tasted the Guru's Teachings,
        and the fire of my desire has been quenched. Attuned to the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, one is naturally intoxicated, merging
        imperceptibly into the Lord. <br>

        of the Beloved Guru. True Glorious Greatness is obtained from
        the Guru, through the Beloved True Name. The One True Lord is
        permeating and pervading among all; how rare is the one who contemplates
        this. The Lord Himself unites us in Union, and forgives us; He
        embellishes us with true devotional worship.  || 7 ||   All is
        Truth; Truth, and Truth alone is pervading; how rare is the Gurmukh
        who knows this. Birth and death occur by the Hukam of His Command;
        the Gurmukh understands his own self. He meditates on the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, and so pleases the True Guru. He receives
        whatever rewards he desires. O Nanak, one who eradicates self-conceit
        from within, has everything.  || 8 || 1 ||   SOOHEE,  THIRD MEHL:
        The body-bride is very beautiful; she dwells with her Husband
        Lord. She becomes the happy soul-bride of her True Husband Lord,
        contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The Lord's
        devotee is forever attuned to the Lord's Love; her ego
        is burnt away from within.  || 1 ||   Waaho! Waaho! Blessed, blessed
        is the Word of the Perfect Guru's Bani. It wells up and
        springs forth from the Perfect Guru, and merges into Truth.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Everything is within the Lord - the continents,
        worlds and nether regions. The Life of the World, the  Great Giver,
        dwells within the body; He is the Cherisher of all. The body-bride
        is eternally beautiful; the Gurmukh contemplates the Naam.  ||
        2 ||   The Lord Himself dwells within the body; He is invisible
        and cannot be seen. The foolish self-willed manmukh does not understand;
        he goes out searching for the Lord externally. One who serves
        the True Guru is always at peace; the True Guru has shown me the
        Invisible Lord.  || 3 ||   Within the body there are jewels and
        precious treasures, the over-flowing treasure of devotion. Within
        this body are the nine continents of the earth, its markets, cities
        and streets. Within this body are the nine treasures of the Naam;
        contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is obtained.
        || 4 ||   Within the body, the Lord estimates the weight; He
        Himself is the weigher. This mind is the jewel, the gem, the diamond;
        it is absolutely priceless. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, cannot
        be purchased at any price; the Naam is obtained by contemplating
        the Guru.  || 5 ||   One who becomes Gurmukh searches this body;
        all others just wander around in confusion. That humble being
        alone obtains it, unto whom the Lord bestows it. What other clever
        tricks can anyone try? Within the body, the Fear of God and Love
        for Him abides; by Guru's Grace, they are obtained.  ||
        6 ||   Within the body, are Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, from whom
        the whole world emanated. The True Lord has staged and contrived
        His own play; the expanse of the Universe comes and goes. The
        Perfect True Guru Himself has made it clear, that emancipation
        comes through the True Name.  || 7 ||   That body, which serves
        the True Guru, is embellished by the True Lord Himself. Without
        the Name, the mortal finds no place of rest in the Court of the
        Lord; he shall be tortured by the Messenger of Death. O Nanak,
        true glory is bestowed, when the Lord showers His Mercy.  || 8

      <p> <font color="#000000">Do not praise the world; it shall simply pass
        away. Do not praise other people; they shall die and turn to dust.
        || 1 ||   Waaho! Waaho! Hail, hail to my Lord and Master. As
        Gurmukh, forever praise the One who is forever True, Independent
        and Carefree.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Making worldly friendships,
        the self-willed manmukhs burn and die. In the City of Death, they
        are bound and gagged and beaten; this opportunity shall never
        come again.  || 2 ||   The lives of the Gurmukhs are fruitful
        and blessed; they are committed to the True Word of the Shabad.
        Their souls are illuminated by the Lord, and they dwell in peace
        and pleasure.  || 3 ||   Those who forget the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad are engrossed in the love of duality. Their hunger and
        thirst never leave them, and night and day, they wander around
        burning.  || 4 ||   Those who make friendships with the wicked,
        and harbor animosity to the Saints, shall drown with their families,
        and their entire lineage shall be obliterated.  || 5 ||   It is
        not good to slander anyone, but the foolish, self-willed manmukhs
        still do it. The faces of the slanderers turn black, and they
        fall into the most horrible hell.  || 6 ||   O mind, as you serve,
        so do you become, and so are the deeds that you do. Whatever you
        yourself plant, that is what you shall have to eat; nothing else
        can be said about this.  || 7 ||   The speech of the great spiritual
        beings has a higher purpose. They are filled to over-flowing with
        Ambrosial Nectar, and they have absolutely no greed at all.  ||
        8 ||   The virtuous accumulate virtue, and teach others. Those
        who meet with them are so very fortunate; night and day, they
        chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 9 ||   He who created
        the Universe, gives sustenance to it. The One Lord alone is the
        Great Giver. He Himself is the True Master.  || 10 ||   That True
        Lord is always with you; the Gurmukh is blessed with His Glance
        of Grace. He Himself shall forgive you, and merge you into Himself;
        forever cherish and contemplate God.  || 11 ||   The mind is impure;
        only the True Lord is pure.  So how can it merge into Him? God
        merges it into Himself, and then it remains merged; through the
        Word of His Shabad, the ego is burnt away.  || 12 ||   Cursed
        is the life in this world, of one who forgets her True Husband
        Lord. The Lord grants His Mercy, and she does not forget Him,
        if she contemplates the Guru's Teachings.  || 13 ||   The
        True Guru unites her, and so she remains united with Him, with
        the True Lord enshrined within her heart. And so united, she will
        not be separated again; she remains in the love and affection
        of the Guru.  || 14 ||   I praise my Husband Lord, contemplating
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Meeting with my Beloved,
        I have found peace; I am His most beautiful and happy soul-bride.
        || 15 ||   The mind of the self-willed manmukh is not softened;
        his consciousness is totally polluted and stone-hearted. Even
        if the venomous snake is fed on milk, it shall still be filled
        with poison.  || 16 ||   He Himself does - who else should
        I ask? He Himself is the Forgiving Lord. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, filth is washed away, and then, one is embellished
        with the ornament of Truth. <br>

      <p> || 17 ||   True is the Banker, and True are His traders. The false
        ones cannot remain there. They do not love the Truth -
        they are consumed by their pain.  || 18 ||   The world wanders
        around in the filth of egotism; it dies, and is re-born, over
        and again. He acts in accordance with the karma of his past actions,
        which no one can erase.  || 19 ||   But if he joins the Society
        of the Saints, then he comes to embrace love for the Truth. Praising
        the True Lord with a truthful mind, he becomes true in the Court
        of the True Lord.  || 20 ||   The Teachings of the Perfect Guru
        are perfect; meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, day and
        night. Egotism and self-conceit are terrible diseases; tranquility
        and stillness come from within.  || 21 ||   I praise my Guru;
        bowing down to Him again and again, I fall at His Feet. I place
        my body and mind in offering unto Him, eradicating self-conceit
        from within.  || 22 ||   Indecision leads to ruin; focus your
        attention on the One Lord. Renounce egotism and self-conceit,
        and remain merged in Truth.  || 23 ||   Those who meet with the
        True Guru are my Siblings of Destiny; they are committed to the
        True Word of the Shabad. Those who merge with the True Lord shall
        not be separated again; they are judged to be True in the Court
        of the Lord.  || 24 ||   They are my Siblings of Destiny, and
        they are my friends, who serve the True Lord. They sell off their
        sins and demerits like straw, and enter into the partnership of
        virtue.  || 25 ||   In the partnership of virtue, peace wells
        up, and they perform true devotional worship service. They deal
        in Truth, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and they
        earn the profit of the Naam.  || 26 ||   Gold and silver may be
        earned by committing sins, but they will not go with you when
        you die. Nothing will go with you in the end, except the Name;
        all are plundered by the Messenger of Death.  || 27 ||   The Lord's
        Name is the nourishment of the mind; cherish it, and preserve
        it carefully within your heart. This nourishment is inexhaustible;
        it is always with the Gurmukhs.  || 28 ||   O mind, if you forget
        the Primal Lord, you shall depart, having lost your honor. This
        world is engrossed in the love of duality; follow the Guru's
        Teachings, and meditate on the True Lord.  || 29 ||   The Lord's
        value cannot be estimated; the Lord's Praises cannot be
        written down. When one's mind and body are attuned to the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, one remains merged in the Lord.
        || 30 ||   My Husband Lord is playful; He has imbued me with
        His Love, with natural ease. The soul-bride is imbued with His
        Love, when her Husband Lord merges her into His Being.  || 31
        ||   Even those who have been separated for so very long, are
        reunited with Him, when they serve the True Guru. The nine treasures
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are deep within the nucleus
        of the self; consuming them, they are still never exhausted. Chant
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, with natural ease.  || 32 ||
        They are not born, and they do not die; they do not suffer in
        pain. Those who are protected by the Guru are saved. They celebrate
        with the Lord.  || 33 ||   Those who are united with the Lord,
        the True Friend, are not separated again; night and day, they
        remain blended with Him. In this world, only a rare few are known,
        O Nanak, to have obtained the True Lord.  || 34 || 1 || 3 || 
        SOOHEE,  THIRD MEHL:  The Dear Lord is subtle and inaccessible;
        how can we ever meet Him? Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, doubt is dispelled, and the Carefree Lord comes to abide
        in the mind.  || 1 ||   The Gurmukhs chant the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har. <br>

      <p> I am a sacrifice to those who chant the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord in their minds forever.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru is
        like the Mansarovar Lake; only the very fortunate beings find
        Him. The Gurmukhs, the selfless servants, seek out the Guru; the
        swan-souls feed there on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2
        ||   The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam, and remain linked to the
        Naam. Whatever is pre-ordained, accept it as the Will of the Guru.
        || 3 ||   By great good fortune, I searched my home, and found
        the treasure of the Naam. The Perfect Guru has shown God to me;
        I have realized the Lord, the Supreme Soul.  || 4 ||   There is
        One God of all; there is no other at all. By Guru's Grace,
        the Lord comes to abide in the mind; in the heart of such a one,
        He is revealed.  || 5 ||   God is the Inner-knower of all hearts;
        God dwells in every place. So who should we call evil? Behold
        the Word of the Shabad, and lovingly dwell upon it.  || 6 || 
        He calls others bad and good, as long as he is in duality. The
        Gurmukh understands the One and Only Lord; He is absorbed in the
        One Lord.  || 7 ||   That is selfless service, which pleases God,
        and which is approved by God. Servant Nanak worships the Lord
        in adoration; he focuses his consciousness on the Guru's
        Feet.  || 8 || 2 || 4 || 9 || <br>

        while you are up. If only I could meet such a Gurmukh; I would
        wash His Feet.  || 4 ||   I long for such a Friend, to unite me
        with my Beloved. Meeting the True Guru, I have found the Lord. <br>

      <p> He has met me, easily and effortlessly.  || 5 ||   The True Guru
        is the Ocean of Virtue of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I have
        such a yearning to see Him! Without Him, I cannot live, even for
        an instant. If I do not see Him, I die.  || 6 ||   As the fish
        cannot survive at all without water, the Saint cannot live without
        the Lord. Without the Lord's Name, he dies.  || 7 ||  
        I am so much in love with my True Guru! How could I even live
        without the Guru, O my mother? I have the Support of the Word
        of the Guru's Bani. Attached to Gurbani, I survive.  ||
        8 ||   The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is a jewel; by the Pleasure
        of His Will, the Guru has given it, O my mother. The True Name
        is my only Support. I remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord's
        Name.  || 9 ||   The wisdom of the Guru is the treasure of the
        Naam. The Guru implants and enshrines the Lord's Name.
        He alone receives it, he alone gets it, who comes and falls at
        the Guru's Feet.  || 10 ||   If only someone would come
        and tell me the Unspoken Speech of the Love of my Beloved. I would
        dedicate my mind to him; I would bow down in humble respect, and
        fall at his feet.  || 11 ||   You are my only Friend, O my All-knowing,
        All-powerful Creator Lord. You have brought me to meet with my
        True Guru. Forever and ever, You are my only strength.  || 12
        ||   My True Guru, forever and ever, does not come and go. He
        is the Imperishable Creator Lord; He is permeating and pervading
        among all.  || 13 ||   I have gathered in the wealth of the Lord's
        Name. My facilities and faculties are intact, safe and sound.
        O Nanak, I am approved and respected in the Court of the Lord;
        the Perfect Guru has blessed me!  || 14 || 1 || 2 || 11 || <br>

        remains entangled in the intoxication of worldly love. His excessive

        Come, and meet with me, O Saints, and good friends; let us chant

        Perfect Guru.  || 2 ||   By the Hukam of God's Will, they
        come into this world, and they leave upon receipt of His Hukam.
        By His Hukam, the Expanse of the Universe is expanded. By His
        Hukam, they enjoy pleasures. One who forgets the Creator Lord,
        suffers sorrow and separation.  || 3 ||   One who is pleasing
        to his God, goes to His Court dressed in robes of honor. One who
        meditates on the Naam, the One Name, finds peace in this world;
        his face is radiant and bright. The Supreme Lord confers honor
        and respect on those who serve the Guru with true love.  || 4

        He loves and cherishes all beings. I have accumulated the true
        treasure, the wealth and riches of the One Name. I shall never
        forget Him from my mind, since He has been so merciful to me. </font><br>
