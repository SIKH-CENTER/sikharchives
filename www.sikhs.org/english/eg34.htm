        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> RAAG AASAA,  EIGHTH HOUSE,  KAAFEE,  FOURTH MEHL:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Death is ordained from the very beginning, and yet ego makes us
        cry. Meditating on the Naam, as Gurmukh, one becomes stable and
        steady.  || 1 ||   Blessed is the Perfect Guru, through whom the
        way of Death is known. The sublime people earn the profit of the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord; they are absorbed in the Word of the
        Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The days of one's life are
        pre-ordained; they will come to their end, O mother. One must
        depart, today or tomorrow, according to the Lord's Primal
        Order.  || 2 ||   Useless are the lives of those, who have forgotten
        the Naam. They play the game of chance in this world, and lose
        their mind.  || 3 ||   Those who have found the Guru are at peace,
        in life and in death. O Nanak, the true ones are truly absorbed
        into the True Lord.  || 4 || 12 || 64 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:
        Having obtained the treasure of this human birth, I meditate
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. By Guru's Grace, I understand,
        and I am absorbed into the True Lord.  || 1 ||   Those who have
        such pre-ordained destiny practice the Naam. The True Lord summons
        the truthful to the Mansion of His Presence.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Deep within is the treasure of the Naam; it is obtained by
        the Gurmukh. Night and day, meditate on the Naam, and sing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 2 ||   Deep within are infinite
        substances, but the self-willed manmukh does not find them. In
        egotism and pride, the mortal's proud self consumes him.
        || 3 ||   O Nanak, his identity consumes his identical identity.
        Through the Guru's Teachings, the mind is illumined, and
        meets the True Lord.  || 4 || 13 || 65 || </p>

        RAAG AASAAVAREE,  SIXTEENTH HOUSE,  FOURTH MEHL,  SUDHANG:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Night and day, I sing the Kirtan, the Praises of the Name of the
        Lord. The True Guru has revealed to me the Name of the Lord; without
        the Lord, I cannot live, for a moment, even an instant.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   My ears hear the Lord's Kirtan, and I contemplate
        Him; without the Lord, I cannot live, even for an instant. As
        the swan cannot live without the lake, how can the Lord's
        slave live without serving Him?  || 1 ||   Some enshrine love
        for duality in their hearts, and some pledge love for worldly
        attachments and ego. The Lord's servant embraces love for
        the Lord and the state of Nirvaanaa; Nanak contemplates the Lord,
        the Lord God.  || 2 || 14 || 66 ||   AASAAVAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:
        O mother, my mother, tell me about my Beloved Lord. Without the
        Lord, I cannot live for a moment, even an instant; I love Him,
        like the camel loves the vine.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My mind has
        become sad and distant, longing for the Blessed Vision of the
        Lord's Darshan, my Friend. </p>

      <p> As the bumblebee cannot live without the lotus, I cannot live
        without the Lord.  || 1 ||   Keep me under Your Protection, O
        Beloved Master of the Universe; fulfill my faith, O Lord of the
        World. Servant Nanak's mind is filled with bliss, when he
        beholds the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, even for
        an instant.  || 2 || 39 || 13 || 15 || 67 || </p>

        RAAG AASAA,  SECOND HOUSE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> One who loves her, is ultimately devoured. One who seats her in
        comfort, is totally terrified by her. Siblings, friends and family,
        beholding her, argue. But she has come under my control, by Guru's
        Grace.  || 1 ||   Beholding her, all are bewitched: the strivers,
        the Siddhas, the demi-gods, angels and mortals. All, except the
        Saadhus, are deceived by her deception.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        Some wander around as renunciates, but they are engrossed in sexual
        desire. Some grow rich as householders, but she does not belong
        to them. Some call themselves men of charity, and she torments
        them terribly. The Lord has saved me, by attaching me to the Feet
        of the True Guru.  || 2 ||   She leads astray the penitents who
        practice penance. The scholarly Pandits are all seduced by greed.
        The world of the three qualities is enticed, and the heavens are
        enticed. The True Guru has saved me, by giving me His Hand.  ||
        3 ||   She is the slave of those who are spiritually wise. With
        her palms pressed together, she serves them and offers her prayer:
        &quot;Whatever you wish, that is what I shall do.&quot;  O servant
        Nanak, she does not draw near to the Gurmukh.  || 4 || 1 ||  
        AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have been separated from my Beloved by
        Maya (my mother-in-law). Hope and desire (my younger brother-in-law
        and sister-in-law) are dying of grief. I am no longer swayed by
        the fear of Death (my elder brother-in-law). I am protected by
        my All-knowing, Wise Husband Lord.  || 1 ||   Listen, O people:
        I have tasted the elixir of love. The evil ones are dead, and
        my enemies are destroyed. The True Guru has given me the Name
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   First, I renounced my egotistical
        love of myself. Second, I renounced the ways of the world. Renouncing
        the three qualities, I look alike upon friend and enemy. And then,
        the fourth state of bliss was revealed to me by the Holy One.
        || 2 ||   In the cave of celestial bliss, I have obtained a seat.
        The Lord of Light plays the unstruck melody of bliss. I am in
        ecstasy, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Imbued
        with my Beloved Husband Lord, I am the blessed, happy soul-bride.
        || 3 ||   Servant Nanak chants the wisdom of God; one who listens
        and practices it, is carried across and saved. He is not born,
        and he does not die; he does not come or go. He remains blended
        with the Lord.  || 4 || 2 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The bride
        shows such special devotion, and has such an agreeable disposition.
        Her beauty is incomparable, and her character is perfect. The
        house in which she dwells is such a praiseworthy house. But rare
        are those who, as Gurmukh, attain that state  || 1 || </p>

      </p>
      <p> As the soul-bride of pure actions, I have met with the Guru. In
        worship, marriage and in the next world, such a soul-bride looks
        beautiful.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As long as she lived with her
        father, her Husband wandered around in sadness. I served and surrendered
        to the Lord, the True Being; the Guru brought my bride to my home,
        and I obtained total happiness.  || 2 ||   She is blessed with
        all sublime attributes, and her generations are unblemished. Her
        Husband, her Lord and Master, fulfills her heart's desires.
        Hope and desire (my younger brother-in-law and sister-in-law)
        are now totally content.  || 3 ||   She is the most noble of all
        the family. She counsels and advises her hope and desire. How
        blessed is that household, in which she has appeared. O servant
        Nanak, she passes her time in perfect peace and comfort.  || 4
        || 3 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Whatever I resolve, she does not
        allow it to come to pass. She stands blocking the way of goodness
        and self-discipline. She wears many disguises, and assumes many
        forms, and she does not allow me to dwell in my own home. She
        forces me to wander around in different directions.  || 1 || 
        She has become the mistress of my home, and she does not allow
        me to live in it. If I try, she fights with me.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   In the beginning, she was sent as a helper, but she has
        overwhelmed the nine continents, all places and interspaces. She
        has not spared even the river banks, the sacred shrines of pilgrimage,
        the Yogis and Sannyaasees, or those who tirelessly read the Simritees
        and study the Vedas.  || 2 ||   Wherever I sit, she sits there
        with me. She has imposed her power upon the whole world. Seeking
        meager protection, I am not protected from her. Tell me, O my
        friend: unto whom should I turn for protection?  || 3 ||   I heard
        of His Teachings, and so I have come to the True Guru. The Guru
        has implanted the Mantra of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, within
        me. And now, I dwell in the home of my own inner self; I sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Infinite Lord. I have met God, O Nanak,
        and I have become care-free.  || 4 ||   My home is now my own,
        and she is now my mistress. She is now my servant, and the Guru
        has made me intimate with the Lord.  || 1 ||  Second Pause  ||
        4 || 4 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  First, they advised me to send
        a letter. Second, they advised me to send two men. Third, they
        advised me to make the effort and do something. But I have renounced
        everything, and I meditate only on You, God.  || 1 ||   Now, I
        am totally blissful, carefree and at ease. The enemies and evil-doers
        have perished, and I have obtained peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The True Guru has imparted the Teachings to me. My soul, body
        and everything belong to the Lord. Whatever I do, is by Your Almighty
        Power. You are my only Support, You are my only Court.  || 2 ||
        If I were to renounce You, God, unto whom could I turn? There
        is no other, comparable to You. Who else is Your servant to serve?
        The faithless cynics are deluded; they wander around in the wilderness.
        || 3 ||   Your Glorious Greatness cannot be described. Wherever
        I am, you save me, hugging me close in Your embrace. Nanak, Your
        slave, has entered Your Sanctuary. God has preserved his honor,
        and congratulations are pouring in.  || 4 || 5 || </p>

      <p> AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Having wandered through foreign lands, I
        have come here to do business. I heard of the incomparable and
        profitable merchandise. I have gathered in my pockets my capital
        of virtue, and I have brought it here with me. Beholding the jewel,
        this mind is fascinated.  || 1 ||   I have come to the door of
        the Trader. Please display the merchandise, so that the business
        may be transacted.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Trader has sent me
        to the Banker. The jewel is priceless, and the capital is priceless.
        O my gentle brother, mediator and friend  -  I have obtained
        the merchandise, and my consciousness is now steady and stable.
        || 2 ||   I have no fear of thieves, of wind or water. I have
        easily made my purchase, and I easily take it away. I have earned
        Truth, and I shall have no pain. I have brought this merchandise
        home, safe and sound.  || 3 ||   I have earned the profit, and
        I am happy. Blessed is the Banker, the Perfect Bestower. How rare
        is the Gurmukh who obtains this merchandise; Nanak has brought
        this profitable merchandise home.  || 4 || 6 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  He does not consider my merits or demerits. He does not
        look at my beauty, color or decorations. I do not know the ways
        of wisdom and good conduct. But taking me by the arm, my Husband
        Lord has led me to His Bed.  || 1 ||   Hear, O my companions,
        my Husband, my Lord Master, possesses me. Placing His Hand upon
        my forehead, He protects me as His Own. What do these ignorant
        people know?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My married life now appears
        so beauteous; my Husband Lord has met me, and He sees all my pains.
        Within the courtyard of my heart, the glory of the moon shines.
        Night and day, I have fun with my Beloved.  || 2 ||   My clothes
        are dyed the deep crimson color of the poppy. All the ornaments
        and garlands around my neck adorn me. Gazing upon my Beloved with
        my eyes, I have obtained all treasures; I have shaken off the
        power of the evil demons.  || 3 ||   I have obtained eternal bliss,
        and I constantly celebrate. With the nine treasures of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, I am satisfied in my own home. Says Nanak,
        when the happy soul-bride is adorned by her Beloved, she is forever
        happy with her Husband Lord.  || 4 || 7 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        They give you donations and worship you. You take from them,
        and then deny that they have given anything to you. That door,
        through which you must ultimately go, O Brahmin  -  at that
        door, you will come to regret and repent.  || 1 ||   Such Brahmins
        shall drown, O Siblings of Destiny; they think of doing evil to
        the innocent.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Within them is greed, and
        they wander around like mad dogs. They slander others and carry
        loads of sin upon their heads. Intoxicated by Maya, they do not
        think of the Lord. Deluded by doubt, they wander off on many paths.
        || 2 ||   Outwardly, they wear various religious robes, but within,
        they are enveloped by poison. They instruct others, but do not
        understand themselves. Such Brahmins will never be emancipated.
        || 3 ||   O foolish Brahmin, reflect upon God. He watches and
        hears, and is always with you. Says Nanak, if this is your destiny,
        renounce your pride, and grasp the Guru's Feet.  || 4 ||

      <p> Pain and disease have left my body, and my mind has become pure;
        I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. I am in bliss,
        meeting with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and now,
        my mind does not go wandering.  || 1 ||   My burning desires are
        quenched, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, O mother.
        The fever of doubt has been totally eliminated; meeting the Guru,
        I am cooled and soothed, with intuitive ease.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   My wandering has ended, since I have realized the One and
        Only Lord; now, I have come to dwell in the eternal place. Your
        Saints are the Saving Grace of the world; beholding the Blessed
        Vision of their Darshan, I remain satisfied.  || 2 ||   I have
        left behind the sins of countless incarnations, now that I have
        grasped the feet of the eternal Holy Guru. My mind sings the celestial
        melody of bliss, and death shall no longer consume it.  || 3 ||
        My Lord, the Cause of all causes, is All-powerful, the Giver
        of peace; He is my Lord, my Lord King. Nanak lives by chanting
        Your Name, O Lord; You are my helper, with me, through and through.
        || 4 || 9 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The slanderer cries out and
        bewails. He has forgotten the Supreme Lord, the Transcendent Lord;
        the slanderer reaps the rewards of his own actions.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   If someone is his companion, then he shall be taken
        along with him. Like the dragon, the slanderer carries his huge,
        useless loads, and burns in his own fire.  || 1 ||   Nanak proclaims
        and announces what happens at the Door of the Transcendent Lord.
        The humble devotees of the Lord are forever in bliss; singing
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, they blossom forth.  ||
        2 || 10 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Even though I totally decorated
        myself, still, my mind was not satisfied. I applied various scented
        oils to my body, and yet, I did not obtain even a tiny bit of
        pleasure from this. Within my mind, I hold such a desire, that
        I may live only to behold my Beloved, O my mother.  || 1 ||  
        O mother, what should I do? This mind cannot rest. It is bewitched
        by the tender love of my Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Garments,
        ornaments, and such exquisite pleasures  -  I look upon these
        as of no account. Likewise, honor, fame, dignity and greatness,
        obedience by the whole world, and a household as beautiful as
        a jewel. If I am pleasing to God's Will, then I shall be
        blessed, and forever in bliss.  || 2 ||   With foods and delicacies
        of so many different kinds, and such abundant pleasures and entertainments,
        power and property and absolute command  -  with these, the
        mind is not satisfied, and its thirst is not quenched. Without
        meeting Him, this day does not pass. Meeting God, I find peace.
        || 3 ||   By searching and seeking, I have heard this news, that
        without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, no one swims
        across. One who has this good destiny written upon his forehead,
        finds the True Guru. His hopes are fulfilled, and his mind is
        satisfied. When one meets God, then his thirst is quenched. Nanak
        has found the Lord, within his mind and body.  || 4 || 11 ||

      <p> PANCH-PADAS:   First, your social status is high. Second, you
        are honored in society. Third, your home is beautiful. But you
        are so ugly, with self-conceit in your mind.  || 1 ||   O beautiful,
        attractive, wise and clever woman: you have been trapped by your
        pride and attachment.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your kitchen is so
        clean. You take your bath, and worship, and apply the crimson
        mark upon your forehead; with your mouth you speak wisdom, but
        you are destroyed by pride. The dog of greed has ruined you in
        every way.  || 2 ||   You wear your robes and enjoy pleasures;
        you practice good conduct to impress people; you apply scented
        oils of sandalwood and musk, but your constant companion is the
        demon of anger.  || 3 ||   Other people may be your water-carriers;
        in this world, you may be a ruler. Gold, silver and wealth may
        be yours, but the goodness of your conduct has been destroyed
        by sexual promiscuity.  || 4 ||   That soul, upon whom the Lord
        has bestowed His Glance of Grace, is delivered from bondage. Joining
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Lord's sublime
        essence is obtained. Says Nanak, how fruitful is that body.  ||
        5 ||   All graces and all comforts shall come to you, as the happy
        soul-bride; you shall be supremely beautiful and wise.  || 1 ||
        Second Pause  || 12 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  IK-TUKAS:  One
        who is seen to be alive, shall surely die. But he who is dead
        shall remain ever-lasting.  || 1 ||   Those who die while yet
        alive, shall through this death, live on. They place the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har, as medicine in their mouths, and through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they drink in the Ambrosial
        Nectar.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The clay pot of the body shall be
        broken. One who has eliminated the three qualities dwells in the
        home of his inner self.  || 2 ||   One who climbs high, shall
        fall into the nether regions of the underworld. One who lies upon
        the ground, shall not be touched by death.  || 3 ||   Those who
        continue to wander around, achieve nothing. Those who practice
        the Guru's Teachings, become steady and stable.  || 4 ||
        This body and soul all belong to the Lord. O Nanak, meeting
        the Guru, I am enraptured.  || 5 || 13 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The puppet of the body has been fashioned with great skill. Know
        for sure that it shall turn to dust.  || 1 ||   Remember your
        origins, O thoughtless fool. Why are you so proud of yourself?
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are a guest, given three meals a day;
        other things are entrusted to you.  || 2 ||   you are just excrement,
        bones and blood, wrapped up in skin  -  this is what you are
        taking such pride in!  || 3 ||   If you could understand even
        one thing, then you would be pure. Without understanding, you
        shall be forever impure.  || 4 ||   Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice
        to the Guru; through Him, I obtain the Lord, the All-knowing Primal
        Being.  || 5 || 14 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  IK-TUKAS,  CHAU-PADAS:
        One moment, one day, is for me many days. My mind cannot survive
        -  how can I meet my Beloved?  || 1 ||   I cannot endure one
        day, even one instant without Him. </p>

      <p> My mind's desire for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is
        so great. Is there any Saint who can lead me to meet my Beloved?
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The four watches of the day are like the
        four ages. And when night comes, I think that it shall never end.
        || 2 ||   The five demons have joined together, to separate me
        from my Husband Lord. Wandering and rambling, I cry out and wring
        my hands.  || 3 ||   The Lord has revealed the Blessed Vision
        of His Darshan to servant Nanak; realizing his own self, he has
        obtained supreme peace.  || 4 || 15 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        In the Lord's service, are the greatest treasures. Serving
        the Lord, the Ambrosial Naam comes into one's mouth.  ||
        1 ||   The Lord is my Companion; He is with me, as my Help and
        Support. In pain and pleasure, whenever I remember Him, He is
        present. How can the poor Messenger of Death frighten me now?
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is my Support; the Lord is my Power.
        The Lord is my Friend; He is my mind's advisor.  || 2 ||
        The Lord is my capital; the Lord is my credit. As Gurmukh, I
        earn the wealth, with the Lord as my Banker.  || 3 ||   By Guru's
        Grace, this wisdom has come. Servant Nanak has merged into the
        Being of the Lord.  || 4 || 16 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  When
        God shows His Mercy, then this mind is focused on Him. Serving
        the True Guru, all rewards are obtained.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        why are you so sad? My True Guru is Perfect. He is the Giver of
        blessings, the treasure of all comforts; His Ambrosial Pool of
        Nectar is always overflowing.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who enshrines
        His Lotus Feet within the heart, meets the Beloved Lord; the Divine
        Light is revealed to him.  || 2 ||   The five companions have
        met together to sing the songs of joy. The unstruck melody, the
        sound current of the Naad, vibrates and resounds.  || 3 ||   O
        Nanak, when the Guru is totally pleased, one meets the Lord, the
        King. Then, the night of one's life passes in peace and natural
        ease.  || 4 || 17 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Showing His Mercy,
        the Lord has revealed Himself to me. Meeting the True Guru, I
        have received the perfect wealth.  || 1 ||   Gather such a wealth
        of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny. It cannot be burned by fire,
        and water cannot drown it; it does not forsake society, or go
        anywhere else.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   It does not run short, and
        it does not run out. Eating and consuming it, the mind remains
        satisfied.  || 2 ||   He is the true banker, who gathers the wealth
        of the Lord within his own home. With this wealth, the whole world
        profits.  || 3 ||   He alone receives the Lord's wealth,
        who is pre-ordained to receive it. O servant Nanak, at that very
        last moment, the Naam shall be your only decoration.  || 4 ||
        18 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Just like the farmer, He plants His
        crop, and, whether it is ripe or unripe, He cuts it down.  ||
        1 ||   Just so, you must know this well, that whoever is born,
        shall die. Only the devotee of the Lord of the Universe becomes
        stable and permanent.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The day shall certainly
        be followed by the night. And when the night passes, the morning
        shall again dawn.  || 2 ||   In the love of Maya, the unfortunate
        ones remain in sleep. </p>

      <p> By Guru's Grace, a rare few remain awake and aware.  || 3
        ||   Says Nanak, sing continually the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord. Your face shall be radiant, and your consciousness shall
        be immaculately pure.  || 4 || 19 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        nine treasures are Yours  -  all treasures are Yours. The Fulfiller
        of desires saves mortals in the end.  || 1 ||   You are my Beloved,
        so what hunger can I have? When You dwell within my mind, pain
        does not touch me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever You do, is acceptable
        to me. O True Lord and Master, True is Your Order.  || 2 ||  
        When it is pleasing to Your Will, I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord. Within Your Home, there is justice, forever and ever.
        || 3 ||   O True Lord and Master, You are unknowable and mysterious.
        Nanak is committed to Your service.  || 4 || 20 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  He is near at hand; He is the eternal Companion of the
        soul. His Creative Power is all-pervading, in form and color.
        || 1 ||   My mind does not worry; it does not grieve, or cry
        out. Imperishable, Unshakable, Unapproachable and forever safe
        and sound is my Husband Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Unto whom
        does Your servant pay homage? His King preserves his honor.  ||
        2 ||   That slave, whom God has released from the restrictions
        of social status  -  who can now hold him in bondage?  || 3
        ||   The Lord is absolutely independent, and totally care-free;
        O servant Nanak, chant His Glorious Praises.  || 4 || 21 ||  
        AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Forsaking the Lord's sublime essence,
        the mortal is intoxicated with false essences. The substance is
        within the home of the self, but the mortal goes out to find it.
        || 1 ||   He cannot hear the true ambrosial discourse. Attached
        to false scriptures, he is engaged in argument.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   He takes his wages from his Lord and Master, but he serves
        another. With such sins, the mortal is engrossed.  || 2 ||   He
        tries to hide from the One who is always with him. He begs from
        Him, again and again.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, God is merciful to
        the meek. As it pleases Him, He cherishes us.  || 4 || 22 || 
        AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my soul,
        my life, my wealth. Here and hereafter, it is with me, to help
        me.  || 1 ||   Without the Lord's Name, everything else is
        useless. My mind is satisfied and satiated by the Blessed Vision
        of the Lord's Darshan.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Gurbani is the
        jewel, the treasure of devotion. Singing, hearing and acting upon
        it, one is enraptured.  || 2 ||   My mind is attached to the Lord's
        Lotus Feet. The True Guru, in His Pleasure, has given this gift.
        || 3 ||   Unto Nanak, the Guru has revealed these instructions:
        recognize the Imperishable Lord God in each and every heart. 
        || 4 || 23 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The All-pervading Lord has
        established joys and celebrations. He Himself embellishes His
        own works.  || 1 ||   Perfect is the Creation of the Perfect Lord
        Master. His magnificent greatness is totally all-pervading.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   His Name is the treasure; His reputation is
        immaculate. He Himself is the Creator; there is no other.  ||
        2 ||   All beings and creatures are in His Hands. God is pervading
        in all, and is always with them.  || 3 || </p>

      <p> The Perfect Guru has fashioned His perfect fashion. O Nanak, the
        Lord's devotees are blessed with glorious greatness.  ||
        4 || 24 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have shaped this mind in the
        mold of the Guru's Word. Beholding the Blessed Vision of
        the Guru's Darshan, I have gathered the wealth of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   O sublime understanding, come, enter into my mind,
        that I may meditate and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
        of the Universe, and love so dearly the Lord's Name.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   I am satisfied and satiated by the True Name.
        My cleansing bath at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage
        is the dust of the Saints.  || 2 ||   I recognize that the One
        Creator is contained in all. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, my understanding is refined.  || 3 ||   I have become
        the servant of all; I have renounced my ego and pride. The Guru
        has given this gift to Nanak.  || 4 || 25 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        My intellect has been enlightened, and my understanding is perfect.
        Thus my evil-mindedness, which kept me far from Him, has been
        removed.  || 1 ||   Such are the Teachings which I have received
        from the Guru; while I was drowning in the pitch black well, I
        was saved, O my Siblings of Destiny.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        Guru is the boat to cross over the totally unfathomable ocean
        of fire; He is treasure of jewels.  || 2 ||   This ocean of Maya
        is dark and treacherous. The Perfect Guru has revealed the way
        to cross over it.  || 3 ||   I do not have the ability to chant
        or practice intense meditation. Guru Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary.
        || 4 || 26 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  TI-PADAS:  One who drinks
        in the Lord's sublime essence is forever imbued with it,
        while other essences wear off in an instant. Intoxicated with
        the Lord's sublime essence, the mind is forever in ecstasy.
        Other essences bring only anxiety.  || 1 ||   One who drinks in
        the Lord's sublime essence, is intoxicated and enraptured;
        all other essences have no effect.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The value
        of the Lord's sublime essence cannot be described. The Lord's
        sublime essence permeates the homes of the Holy. One may spend
        thousands and millions, but it cannot be purchased. He alone obtains
        it, who is so pre-ordained.  || 2 ||  Tasting it, Nanak is wonder-struck.
        Through the Guru, Nanak has obtained this taste. Here and hereafter,
        it does not leave him. Nanak is imbued and enraptured with the
        Lord's subtle essence.  || 3 || 27 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        If she renounces and eliminates her sexual desire, anger, greed
        and attachment, and her evil-mindedness and self-conceit as well;
        and if, becoming humble, she serves Him, then she becomes dear
        to her Beloved's Heart.  || 1 ||   Listen, O beautiful soul-bride:
        By the Word of the Holy Saint, you shall be saved. Your pain,
        hunger and doubt shall vanish, and you shall obtain peace, O happy
        soul-bride.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Washing the Guru's feet,
        and serving Him, the soul is sanctified, and the thirst for sin
        is quenched. If you become the slave of the slave of the Lord's
        slaves, then you shall obtain honor in the Court of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   This is right conduct, and this is the correct lifestyle,
        to obey the Command of the Lord's Will; this is your devotional
        worship. One who practices this Mantra, O Nanak, swims across
        the terrifying world-ocean.  || 3 || 28 || </p>

        human body. This is your chance to meet the Lord of the Universe.
        Other efforts are of no use to you. Joining the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, vibrate and meditate on the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Make the effort, and cross over the
        terrifying world ocean. This human life is passing away in vain,
        in the love of Maya.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have not practiced
        meditation, penance, self-restraint or righteous living; I have
        not served the Holy Saints, and I do not know the Lord, my King.
        Says Nanak, my actions are vile and despicable; O Lord, I seek
        Your Sanctuary  -  please, preserve my honor.  || 2 || 29 ||
        AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Without You, there is no other for me;
        You alone are in my mind. You are my Friend and Companion, God;
        why should my soul be afraid?  || 1 ||   You are my support, You
        are my hope. While sitting down or standing up, while sleeping
        or waking, with every breath and morsel of food, I never forget
        You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Protect me, please protect me, O God;
        I have come to Your Sanctuary; the ocean of fire is so horrible.
        The True Guru is the Giver of peace to Nanak; I am Your child,
        O Lord of the World.  || 2 || 30 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        Lord God has saved me, His slave. My mind has surrendered to my
        Beloved; my fever has taken poison and died.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Cold and heat do not touch me at all, when I sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord. My consciousness is not affected by the witch,
        Maya; I take to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Lotus Feet. 
        || 1 ||   By the Grace of the Saints, the Lord has shown His Mercy
        to me; He Himself is my Help and Support. Nanak ever sings the
        Praises of the Lord, the treasure of excellence; his doubts and
        pains are eliminated.  || 2 || 31 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  I
        have taken the medicine of the Name of the Lord. I have found
        peace, and the seat of pain has been removed.  || 1 ||   The fever
        has been broken, by the Teachings of the Perfect Guru. I am in
        ecstasy, and all of my sorrows have been dispelled.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   All beings and creatures obtain peace, O Nanak, meditating
        on the Supreme Lord God.  || 2 || 32 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        That time, which the mortal does not wish for, eventually comes.
        Without the Lord's Command, how can understanding be understood?
        || 1 ||   The body is consumed by water, fire and earth. But
        the soul is neither young nor old, O Siblings of Destiny.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Servant Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the
        Holy. By Guru's Grace, he has shaken off the fear of death.
        || 2 || 33 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Forever and ever, the soul
        is illumined; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, it
        dwells at the Feet of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Chant the Lord's
        Name each and every day, O my mind. You shall find lasting peace,
        contentment and tranquility, and all your sins shall depart. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Says Nanak, one who is blessed with perfect
        good karma, meets the True Guru, and obtains the Perfect Supreme
        Lord God.  || 2 || 34 ||  Thirty-four Shabads in Second House.

        and she attains celestial peace, joy and comfort.  || 1 ||   In
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, she sings the Glorious
        Praises of the Immeasurable Lord. Remembering the Lord in meditation,
        O Nanak, she becomes invaluable.  || 2 || 35 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Sexual desire, anger, intoxication with Maya and jealousy
        -  I have lost all of these in the game of chance. Purity,
        contentment, compassion, faith and truthfulness  -  I have
        ushered these into the home of my self.  || 1 ||   All the loads
        of birth and death have been removed. Joining the Saints'
        Society, my mind has become pure; the Perfect Guru has saved me
        in an instant.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My mind has become the dust
        of all, and everyone seems a sweet friend to me. My Lord and Master
        is contained in all. He gives His Gifts to all beings, and cherishes
        them.  || 2 ||   He Himself is the One and only; from the One,
        the One and only, came the expanse of the entire creation. Chanting
        and meditating, all the humble beings have become Holy; meditating
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, so many have been saved.  ||
        3 ||   The Lord of the Universe is deep, profound and infinite;
        He has no end or limitation. By Your Grace, Nanak sings Your Glorious
        Praises; meditating, meditating, he humbly bows to God.  || 4
        || 36 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are Infinite, Eternal and
        Incomprehensible; all this is Your Creation. What clever games
        can we play, when everything is contained in You?  || 1 ||   O
        my True Guru, protect me, Your child, through the power of Your
        play.  Grant me the good sense to ever sing Your Glorious Praises,
        O my Inaccessible and Infinite Lord and Master.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The mortal is preserved in the womb of his mother, by the
        Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he makes merry, and
        with each and every breath he remembers the Lord, and the fire
        does not touch him.  || 2 ||   Others' wealth, others'
        wives, and the slander of others  -  renounce your craving
        for these. Serve the Lord's Lotus Feet within your heart,
        and hold to the Support of the Perfect Guru.  || 3 ||   Houses,
        mansions and palaces which you see  -  none of these shall
        go with you. As long as you live in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,
        O servant Nanak, remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  ||
