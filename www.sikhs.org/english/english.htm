<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">by Singh Sahib Dr. Sant Singh Khalsa</font></b><br>
          
          <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Bhai Gopal 
          Singh Translation</font></b> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The first complete 
            translation of the Siri Guru Granth Sahib into English was provided 
            by Dr. Gopal Singh; this was completed around 1960. It was published 
            in a four volume set, and has received wide distribution. The 'International 
            Edition' published by the World Sikh University Press in 1978, has a 
            light blue cover. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Dr. Gopal Singh's 
            stellar reputation for scholarly work in service of the Dharma is well 
            deserved. In fact, the introduction to the work, in the first of the 
            four volumes, is a remarkable work in and of itself. Especially readable 
            and worthwhile is Section II: On the Philosophy of Sikh Religion. In 
            this treatise on comparative religion, he traces the common threads 
            of religious thought throughout the ages, giving one a deeper appreciation 
            of Sikh Dharma. His brief explanation of the Kundalini and Yogic traditions 
            is well-done. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> His grammar, however, 
            is somewhat antiquated and distracting. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For example: </font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yea Manifests 
            He in a myriad ways.&quot;<br>
  &quot;For several births thou wert a mere worm.&quot;<br>
  &quot;He, (whose way is this,) Knows his Master and Compassion comes 
            into him, And becomes Eternal he: he dies not thereafter.&quot; </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He included excellent 
            footnotes explaining legendary persons, Hindu mythology and local folk 
            idioms, and these often reveal more clearly the true meaning of the 
            Guru's Word. Often, he explains the linguistic derivation of a word 
            or idiom. From his thorough understanding of comparative religion, he 
            brings to light the common threads which run through Sikhism and other 
            religions. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Page breaks are 
            only roughly approximated to the original, and the numbering system 
            of the original is roughly preserved, although there are a large number 
            of mistakes in the numbers. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
            <b>2. Manmohan Singh Translation</b></font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A very different 
            translation was published just a short time after Dr. Gopal Singh's 
            work came out. Back in 1948, after Sardar Manmohan Singh, a devout Sikh, 
            lost everything worldly in the partition of India and Pakistan, he began 
            work on what would be a lasting legacy. He worked on this for 12 years, 
            completing it in 1960. This is the &euml;eight-volume set&iacute; with 
            the original Gurmukhi, side-by-side with translations into English and 
            Panjabi, with nearly every word individually cross-referenced across 
            the three languages. The S.G.P.C. published and distributed this 8-volume 
            set in a dark blue cover, starting with the first volume in 1962, and 
            completing the eighth in 1969, the year in which Manmohan Singh passed 
            on. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For the first time, 
            Sikhs all around the world had access to a most practical resource in 
            understanding the Word of the Guru. It has become common practice in 
            all parts of the world to install this 8 volume set as Guru, and read 
            out the Hukam in both Gurmukhi and English, and sometimes in Panjaabi 
            as well. Many Gurdwaras, especially larger ones, have a single volume 
            Bir installed, and use this 8-volume set to read out the translation. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Page breaks <i>appear</i> to be precisely placed, but are not correlated to the original with 
            any precision, and there are many typographical errors. There are also 
            small passages of the original which are omitted in this work-again, 
            typographical mistakes. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Overall, this work 
            represents a distinctly more accurate and direct translation of the 
            Guru's Word, although it includes a large number of antiquated, idiosyncratic 
            expressions more common to 18th and 19th century British India-words 
            like mammon (for Maya), myrmidon, collyrium, mumpers, gnosis (for knowledge), 
            apostates, sans (French for without), etc. Much of his grammar is so 
            dated as to be distracting, and even confusing to the modern ear. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For example: </font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Raising, 
            the embankments of my mind's field, I gaze at the high sky or mansion. 
            When Divine devotion enters bride's mind-home, the Friendly Guest pays 
            her a visit.&quot;<br>
            He, who slanders Thy attendant, him Thou chrusheth and destroyest&quot;. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In spite of these 
            difficulties, the translation has a much deeper impact, and a more obvious 
            accuracy, than the Bhai Gopal Singh translation. It is very poetic, 
            and conveys a sense of humility and devotion. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
            <b>3. Gurbachan Singh Talib Translation</b></font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> According to his 
            own introduction to the book, Gurbachan Singh Talib of Panjabi University, 
            Patiala, was assigned in 1977 the task of compiling a new translation 
            of the Siri Guru Granth Sahib. It is grammatically the least satisfying 
            - that is, the most distracting -of the three works so far. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For example: </font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In listening to 
            laudation of the Name etemal find I life.&quot;<br>
  &quot;To whomsoever the vision of unicity does grant, propped by the holy 
            congregation, of the Lord's love has joy&quot; </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He does include 
            many useful footnotes, shedding some light on the Guru's Teachings. 
            Overall, however, it adds little to the Manmohan Singh translation, 
            and it has not superseded either of the previous translations. <i>(This 
              is the translation found on the commercial CD Scriptures &amp; the Heritage 
              of Sikhs - ssb)</i></font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
            <b>4. Pritam Singh Chahil Translation</b></font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> More recently, 
            in 1993, another work was printed and made available. Pritam Singh Chahil 
            printed the Manmohan Singh Edition back in Chandigarh, in the 1960's; 
            in 1986, he was inspired by a Gurdwara service in Berkeley, in which 
            the '8 volume set' was installed as Guru, and 'Shabad sheets' were passed 
            out to the Sangat. He had a vision that the entire Guru should be printed 
            in this three-column format, and so he set about to do it. He completed 
            it in 1990, and in 1993, it became available. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It is in a three-column 
            format, with Gurmukhi on the left, English translation on the right, 
            and Romanised transliteration in the center of each page. He has made 
            a fairly close, but not exact, approximation of page breaks, and preserved 
            the numbering system fairly well. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This translation 
            is a revised version of the Manmohan Singh translation, and as thus, 
            it is the finest complete translation of the Guru yet published; its 
            unique format allows the Guru's Word to be approximated in pronunciation, 
            even by those who do not yet read Gurmukhi. However, the transliteration 
            system used is the old British-English transliteration, wherein the 
            word for <img src="comp1.gif"> - KAYSH - meaning 'hair' - is transliterated 
            as KESH. Most modern readers will pronounce KESH to rhyme with 'mesh', 
            thereby mispronouncing this important word. This is the same transliteration 
            system by which most of us mispronounced <img src="comp2.gif"> -'Nit 
            Naym'; {We read the transliteration 'NIT NEM', and we mispronounced 
            it.} *'NIT NAYM' <i>and</i> KAYSH' <i>are the</i> correct <i>pronunciations</i>. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Also, some of the 
            more distracting idioms and antiquated expressions of the Manmohan Singh 
            translation are copied verbatim. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It is distributed 
            in two forms: a four-volume set, and also a single volume. It is eminently 
            suitable for installation in Gurdwara. It is a large volume, 12 by 17 
            inches (34 inches wide when opened). It is also a very valuable tool 
            in the process of learning to read and understand Gurmukhi, although 
            it does not have the word -to-word notations of the Manmohan Singh edition. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
            <b>5. Khalsa Consensus Translation</b></font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This translation 
            is already available on CD <i>(and now on The Sikhism Home Page -ssb)</i>. 
            It is based on all the available translations, working primarily from 
            the Manmohan Singh translation. The objectives are: </font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="ybullet.gif" align="top"> first, to achieve an accurate translation of the Guru's Word;<br>
            <img src="ybullet.gif" align="top"> to present the Guru's Word in an 
            elegant format which follows the original as much as possible;<br>
            <img src="ybullet.gif" align="top"> to eliminate the antiquated idioms 
            which are so distracting to the modern ear,<br>
            <img src="ybullet.gif" align="top"> to preserve the word order and symmetry 
            of the original whenever possible: and<br>
            <img src="ybullet.gif" align="top"> to achieve the immediacy of impact 
            which the Guru's Word deserves in translation. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In this version, 
            we are preserving exact page breaks to the original, along with all 
            of the numbers at the ends of lines. </font> </p>
