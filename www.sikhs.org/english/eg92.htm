      <p> Such a Paakhandi does not grow old or die. Says Charpat, God is
        the embodiment of Truth; the supreme essence of reality has no
        shape or form.  || 5 ||   FIRST MEHL:  He alone is a Bairaagi,
        who turns himself toward God. In the Tenth Gate, the sky of the
        mind, he erects his pillar. Night and day, he remains in deep
        inner meditation. Such a Bairaagi is just like the True Lord.
        Says Bhart'har, God is the embodiment of Truth; the supreme
        essence of reality has no shape or form.  || 6 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        How is evil eradicated? How can the true way of life be found?
        What is the use of piercing the ears, or begging for food? Throughout
        existence and non-existence, there is only the Name of the One
        Lord. What is that Word, which holds the heart in its place? When
        you look alike upon sunshine and shade, says Nanak, then the Guru
        will speak to you. The students follow the six systems. They are
        neither worldly people, nor detached renunciates. One who remains
        absorbed in the Formless Lord - why should he go out begging?
        || 7 ||   PAUREE:  That alone is said to be the Lord's
        temple, where the Lord is known. In the human body, the Guru's
        Word is found, when one understands that the Lord, the Supreme
        Soul, is in all. Don't look for Him outside your self.
        The Creator, the Architect of Destiny, is within the home of your
        own heart. The self-willed manmukh does not appreciate the value
        of the Lord's temple; they waste away and lose their lives.
        The One Lord is pervading in all; through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, He can be found.  || 12 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Only
        a fool listens to the words of the fool. What are the signs of
        the fool? What does the fool do? A fool is stupid; he dies of
        egotism. His actions always bring him pain; he lives in pain.
        If someone's beloved friend falls into the pit, what can
        be used to pull him out? One who becomes Gurmukh contemplates
        the Lord, and remains detached. Chanting the Lord's Name,
        he saves himself, and he carries across those who are drowning
        as well. O Nanak, he acts in accordance with the Will of God;
        he endures whatever he is given.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Says
        Nanak, listen, O mind, to the True Teachings. Opening His ledger,
        God will call you to account. Those rebels who have unpaid accounts
        shall be called out. Azraa-eel, the Angel of Death, shall be appointed
        to punish them. They will find no way to escape coming and going
        in reincarnation; they are trapped in the narrow path. Falsehood
        will come to an end, O Nanak, and Truth will prevail in the end.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The body and everything belongs to the Lord;
        the Lord Himself is all-pervading. The Lord's value cannot
        be estimated; nothing can be said about it. By Guru's Grace,
        one praises the Lord, imbued with feelings of devotion. The mind
        and body are totally rejuvenated, and egotism is eradicated. Everything
        is the play of the Lord. The Gurmukh understands this.  || 13
        ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Branded with a thousand marks of disgrace,
        Indra cried in shame. Paras Raam returned home crying. Ajai cried
        and weeped, when he was made to eat the manure he had given, pretending
        it was charity. Such is the punishment received in the Court of
        the Lord. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Rama weeped when he was sent into exile, and separated from Sita
        and Lakhshman. The ten-headed Raawan, who stole away Sita with
        the beat of his tambourine, wept when he lost Sri Lanka. The Paandavas
        once lived in the Presence of the Lord; they were made slaves,
        and wept. Janmayjaa wept, that he had lost his way. One mistake,
        and he became a sinner. The Shaykhs, Pirs and spiritual teachers
        weep; at the very last instant, they suffer in agony. The kings
        weep - their ears are cut; they go begging from house to
        house. The miser weeps; he has to leave behind the wealth he has
        gathered. The Pandit, the religious scholar, weeps when his learning
        is gone. The young woman weeps because she has no husband. O Nanak,
        the whole world is suffering. He alone is victorious, who believes
        in the Lord's Name. No other action is of any account.
        || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Meditation, austerity and everything
        come through belief in the Lord's Name. All other actions
        are useless. O Nanak, believe in the One who is worth believing
        in. By Guru's Grace, he is realized.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        The union of the body and the soul-swan was pre-ordained by the
        Creator Lord. He is hidden, and yet pervading all. He is revealed
        to the Gurmukh. Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and
        chanting His Praises, one merges in His Glories. True is the True
        Word of the Guru's Bani. One unites in Union with the True
        Lord. He Himself is everything; He Himself grants glorious greatness.
        || 14 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  O Nanak, the blind man may
        go to appraise the jewels, but he will not know their value; he
        will return home after exposing his ignorance.  || 1 ||   SECOND
        MEHL:  The Jeweller has come, and opened up the bag of jewels.
        The merchandise and the merchant are merged together. They alone
        purchase the gem, O Nanak, who have virtue in their purse. Those
        who do not appreciate the value of the jewels, wander like blind
        men in the world.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The fortress of the body
        has nine gates; the tenth gate is kept hidden. The rigid door
        is not open; only through the Word of the Guru's Shabad
        can it be opened. The unstruck sound current resounds and vibrates
        there. The Word of the Guru's Shabad is heard. Deep within
        the nucleus of the heart, the Divine Light shines forth. Through
        devotional worship, one meets the Lord. The One Lord is pervading
        and permeating all. He Himself created the creation.  || 15 ||
        SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  He is truly blind, who follows the way
        shown by the blind man. O Nanak, why should the one who can see,
        get lost? Do not call them blind, who have no eyes in their face.
        They alone are blind, O Nanak, who wander away from their Lord
        and Master.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  One whom the Lord has made
        blind - the Lord can make him see again. He acts only as
        he knows, although he may be spoken to a hundred times. Where
        the real thing is not seen, self-conceit prevails there -
        know this well. O Nanak, how can the purshaser purchase the real
        thing, if he cannot recognize it?  || 2 ||   SECOND MEHL:  How
        can someone be called blind, if he was made blind by the Lord's
        Command? <br>
      </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, one who does not understand the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command should be called blind.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  Deep within
        the body is the fortress of the Lord, and all lands and countries.
        He Himself sits in primal, profound Samaadhi; He Himself is all-pervading.
        He Himself created the Universe, and He Himself remains hidden
        within it. Serving the Guru, the Lord is known, and the Truth
        is revealed. He is True, the Truest of the True; the Guru has
        imparted this understanding.  || 16 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        Night is the summer season, and day is the winter season; sexual
        desire and anger are the two fields planted. Greed prepares the
        soil, and the seed of falsehood is planted; attachment and love
        are the farmer and hired hand. Contemplation is the plow, and
        corruption is the harvest; this is what one earns and eats, according
        to the Hukam of the Lord's Command. O Nanak, when one is
        called to give his account, he will be barren and infertile. 
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Make the Fear of God the farm, purity the
        water, truth and contentment the cows and bulls, humility the
        plow, consciousness the plowman, remembrance the preparation of
        the soil, and union with the Lord the planting time. Let the Lord's
        Name be the seed, and His Forgiving Grace the harvest. Do this,
        and the whole world will seem false. O Nanak, if He bestows His
        Merciful Glance of Grace, then all your separation will be ended.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The self-willed manmukh is trapped in the
        darkness of emotional attachment; in the love of duality he speaks.
        The love of duality brings pain forever; he churns the water endlessly.
        The Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he churns,
        and obtains the essence of reality. The Divine Light illuminates
        his heart deep within; he seeks the Lord, and obtains Him. He
        Himself deludes in doubt; no one can comment on this.  || 17 ||
        SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  O Nanak, don't be anxious; the
        Lord will take care of you. He created the creatures in water,
        and He gives them their nourishment. There are no stores open
        there, and no one farms there. No business is ever transacted
        there, and no one buys or sells. Animals eat other animals; this
        is what the Lord has given them as food. He created them in the
        oceans, and He provides for them as well. O Nanak, don't
        be anxious; the Lord will take care of you.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        O Nanak, this soul is the fish, and death is the hungry fisherman.
        The blind man does not even think of this. And suddenly, the net
        is cast. O Nanak, his consciousness is unconscious, and he departs,
        bound by anxiety. But if the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace,
        then He unites the soul with Himself.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  They
        are true, forever true, who drink in the sublime essence of the
        Lord. The True Lord abides in the mind of the Gurmukh; He strikes
        the true bargain. Everything is in the home of the self within;
        only the very fortunate obtain it. The hunger within is conquered
        and overcome, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. He Himself
        unites in His Union; He Himself blesses them with understanding.
        || 18 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  The cotton is ginned, woven
        and spun; the cloth is laid out, washed and bleached white. The
        tailor cuts it with his scissors, and sews it with his thread.
        Thus, the torn and tattered honor is sewn up again, through the
        Lord's Praise, O Nanak, and one lives the true life. Becoming
        worn, the cloth is torn; with needle and thread it is sewn up
        again. It will not last for a month, or even a week. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>
          <a name="p956" id="p956"><b>Page 956</b></a><br>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> It barely lasts for an hour, or even a moment. But the Truth does
        not grow old; and when it is stitched, it is never torn again.
        O Nanak, the Lord and Master is the Truest of the True. While
        we meditate on Him, we see Him.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The knife
        is Truth, and its steel is totally True. Its workmanship is incomparably
        beautiful. It is sharpened on the grindstone of the Shabad. It
        is placed in the scabbard of virtue. If the Shaykh is killed with
        that, then the blood of greed will spill out. One who is slaughtered
        in this ritualistic way, will be attached to the Lord. O Nanak,
        at the Lord's door, he is absorbed into His Blessed Vision.
        || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  A beautiful dagger hangs by your waist,
        and you ride such a beautiful horse. But don't be too proud;
        O Nanak, you may fall head first to the ground.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:
        They alone walk as Gurmukh, who receive the Shabad in the Sat
        Sangat, the True Congregation. Meditating on the True Lord, they
        become truthful; they carry in their robes the supplies of the
        Lord's wealth. The devotees look beautiful, singing the
        Praises of the Lord; following the Guru's Teachings, they
        become stable and unchanging. They enshrine the jewel of contemplation
        within their minds, and the most sublime Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. He Himself unites in His Union; He Himself grants glorious
        greatness.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Everyone is filled
        with hope; hardly anyone is free of hope. O Nanak, blessed is
        the birth of one, who remains dead while yet alive.  || 1 || 
        THIRD MEHL:  Nothing is in the hands of hope. How can one become
        free of hope? What can this poor being do? The Lord Himself creates
        confusion.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Cursed is the life in this world,
        without the True Name. God is the Great Giver of givers. His wealth
        is permanent and unchanging. That humble being is immaculate,
        who worships the Lord with each and every breath. With your tongue,
        vibrate the One Inaccessible Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts. He is all-pervading everywhere. Nanak is a sacrifice
        to Him.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  The union between the
        lake of the True Guru, and the swan of the soul, was pre-ordained
        from the very beginning, by the Pleasure of the Lord's
        Will. The diamonds are in this lake; they are the food of the
        swams. The cranes and the ravens may be very wise, but they do
        not remain in this lake. They do not find their food there; their
        food is different. Practicing Truth, the True Lord is found. False
        is the pride of the false. O Nanak, they alone meet the True Guru,
        who are so pre-destined by the Lord's Command.   || 1 ||
        My Lord and Master is immaculate, as are those who think of Him.
        O Nanak, serve Him, who gives to you forever and ever. O Nanak,
        serve Him; by serving Him, sorrow is dispelled. Faults and demerits
        vanish, and virtues take their place; peace comes to dwell in
        the mind.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself is all-pervading; He
        Himself is absorbed in the profound state of Samaadhi. He Himself
        instructs; the Gurmukh is satisfied and fulfilled. Some, He causes
        to wander in the wilderness, while others are committed to His
        devotional worship. He alone understands, whom the Lord causes
        to understand; He Himself attaches mortals to His Name. O Nanak,
        meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, true greatness 
        is obtained.  || 21 || 1 ||  SUDH  || <br>

      </p>
      <p> <font color="#000000">SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  As I have heard of the
        True Guru, so I have seen Him. He re-unites the separated ones
        with God; He is the Mediator at the Court of the Lord. He implants
        the Mantra of the Lord's Name, and eradicates the illness
        of egotism. O Nanak, he alone meets the True Guru, who has such
        union pre-ordained.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  If the One Lord is
        my Friend, then all are my friends. If the One Lord is my enemy,
        then all fight with me. The Perfect Guru has shown me that, without
        the Name, everything is useless. The faithless cynics and the
        evil people wander in reincarnation; they are attached to other
        tastes. Servant Nanak has realized the Lord God, by the Grace
        of the Guru, the True Guru.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Creator Lord
        created the Creation. He Himself is the perfect Banker; He Himself
        earns His profit. He Himself made the expansive Universe; He Himself
        is imbued with joy. The value of God's almighty creative
        power cannot be estimated. He is inaccessible, unfathomable, endless,
        the farthest of the far. He Himself is the greatest Emperor; He
        Himself is His own Prime Minister. No one knows His worth, or
        the greatness of His resting place. He Himself is our True Lord
        and Master. He reveals Himself to the Gurmukh.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Listen, O my beloved friend: please show me the
        True Guru. I dedicate my mind to Him; I keep Him continually enshrined
        within my heart. Without the One and Only True Guru, life in this
        world is cursed. O servant Nanak, they alone meet the True Guru,
        with whom He constantly abides.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Deep within
        me is the longing to meet You; how can I find You, God? I will
        search for someone, some friend, who will unite me with my Beloved.
        The Perfect Guru has united me with Him; wherever I look, there
        He is. Servant Nanak serves that God; there is no other as great
        as He is.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He is the Great Giver, the Generous
        Lord; with what mouth can I praise Him? In His Mercy, He protects,
        preserves and sustains us. No one is under anyone else's
        control; He is the One Support of all. He cherishes all as His
        children, and reaches out with His hand. He stages His joyous
        plays, which no one understands at all. The all-powerful Lord
        gives His Support to all; I am a sacrifice to Him. Night and day,
        sing the Praises of the One who is worthy of being praised. Those
        who fall at the Guru's Feet, enjoy the sublime essence
        of the Lord.  || 2 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  He has widened the
        narrow path for me, and preserved my integrity, along with that
        of my family. He Himself has arranged and resolved my affairs.
        I dwell upon that God forever. God is my mother and father; He
        hugs me close in His embrace, and cherishes me, like His tiny
        baby. All beings and creatures have become kind and compassionate
        to me. <br>

        most miserable of miseries. Please bless me with Your Name, and
        make me content; may the hunger of my mind be satisfied. The Guru
        has made the woods and meadows green again. O Nanak, is it any
        wonder that He blesses human beings as well?  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Such is that Great Giver; may I never forget Him from my mind.
        I cannot survive without Him, for an instant, for a moment, for
        a second. Inwardly and outwardly, He is with us; how can we hide
        anything from Him? One whose honor He Himself has preserved, crosses
        over the terrifying world-ocean. He alone is a devotee, a spiritual
        teacher, and a disciplined pratictioner of meditation, whom the
        Lord has so blessed. He alone is perfect and renowned as supreme,
        whom the Lord has blessed with His power. He alone endures the
        unendurable, whom the Lord inspires to endure it. And he alone
        meets the True Lord, within whose mind the Guru's Mantra
        is implanted.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Blessed are those
        beautiful Ragas which, when chanted, quench all thirst. Blessed
        are those beautiful people who, as Gurmukh, chant the Name of
        the Lord. I am a sacrifice to those who single-mindedly worship
        and adore the One Lord. I yearn for the dust of their feet; by
        His Grace, it is obtained. I am a sacrifice to those who are imbued
        with love for the Lord of the Universe. I tell them the state
        of my soul, and pray that I may be united with the Sovereign Lord
        King, my Friend. The Perfect Guru has united me with Him, and
        the pains of birth and death have departed. Servant Nanak has
        found the inaccessible, infinitely beautiful Lord, and he will
        not go anywhere else.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Blessed is that
        time, blessed is that hour, blessed is that second, excellent
        is that instant; blessed is that day, and that opportunity, when
        I gazed upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.
        The mind's desires are fulfilled, when the inaccessible,
        unfathomable Lord is obtained. Egotism and emotional attachment
        are eradicated, and one leans only on the Support of the True
        Name. O servant Nanak, one who is committed to the Lord's
        service - the whole world is saved along with him.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  How rare are those who are blessed to praise the
        Lord, in devotional worship. Those who are blessed with the Lord's
        treasures are not called to give their account again. Those who
        are imbued with His Love are absorbed in ecstasy. They take the
        Support of the One Name; the One Name is their only food. For
        their sake, the world eats and enjoys. Their Beloved Lord belongs
        to them alone. The Guru comes and meets them; they alone know
        God. I am a sacrifice to those who are pleasing to their Lord
        and Master.  || 4 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  My friendship is
        with the One Lord alone; I am in love with the One Lord alone.
        The Lord is my only friend; my companionship is with the One Lord
        alone. My conversation is with the One Lord alone; He never frowns,
        or turns His face away. He alone knows the state of my soul; He
        never ignores my love. He is my only counselor, all-powerful to
        destroy and create. The Lord is my only Giver. He places His hand
        upon the heads of the generous in the world. I take the Support
        of the One Lord alone; He is all-powerful, over the heads of all.
        The Saint, the True Guru, has united me with the Lord. <br>

      <p> He placed His hand on my forehead. The Guru led me to meet the
        greatest Lord and Master; He saved the whole world. The desires
        of the mind are fulfilled; I have attained my pre-destined Union
        with God. Nanak has obtained the True Name; He enjoys the enjoyments
        forever.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Friendship with the self-willed
        manmukhs is an alliance with Maya. As we watch, they run away;
        they never stand firm. As long as they get food and clothing,
        they stick around. But on that day when they receive nothing,
        then they start to curse. The self-willed manmukhs are ignorant
        and blind; they do not know the secrets of the soul. The false
        bond does not last; it is like stones joined with mud. The blind
        do not understand themselves; they are engrossed in false worldly
        entanglements. Entangled in false attachments, they pass their
        lives in egotism and self-conceit. But that being, whom the Lord
        has blessed with His Mercy from the very beginning, does perfect
        deeds, and accumulates good karma. O servant Nanak, those humble
        beings alone are saved, who enter the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who are imbued with the Lord's
        Vision, speak the Truth. How can I obtain the dust of those who
        realize their Lord and Master? The mind, stained by corruption,
        becomes pure by associating with them. One sees the Mansion of
        the Lord's Presence, when the door of doubt is opened.
        That one, unto whom the Mansion of the Lord's Presence
        is revealed, is never pushed or shoved. My mind and body are enraptured,
        when the Lord blesses me, even for an instant, with His Glance
        of Grace. The nine treasures, and the treasure of the Naam are
        obtained by commitment to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        He alone is blessed with the dust of the feet of the Saints, upon
        whose forehead such pre-ordained desiny is inscribed.  || 5 ||
        SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  O deer-eyed bride, I speak the Truth,
        which shall save you. Listen to these beautiful words, O beauteous
        bride; your Beloved Lord is your mind's only support. You
        have fallen in love with an evil person; tell me - show
        me why! I lack nothing, and I am not sad or depressed; I have
        no deficiency at all. I abandoned and lost my fascinating and
        beautiful Husband Lord; in this evil-mindedness, I have lost my
        good fortune. I am not mistaken, and I am not confused; I have
        no egotism, and commit no offense. As You have linked me, so I
        am linked; listen to my true message. She alone is the blessed
        soul-bride, and she alone is fortunate, upon whom the Husband
        Lord has showered His Mercy. Her Husband Lord takes away all her
        faults and mistakes; hugging her close in His embrace, He embellishes
        her. The unfortunate soul-bride makes this prayer: O Nanak, when
        will my turn come? All the blessed soul-brides celebrate and make
        merry; bless me as well with a night of bliss, O Lord.  || 1 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  Why do you waver, O my mind? The Lord is the Fulfiller
        of hopes and desires. Meditate on the True Guru, the Primal Being;
        He is the Destroyer of all pains. Worship and adore the Lord's
        Name, O my mind; all sinful residues and corruption shall be washed
        away. Those who are blessed with such pre-ordained destiny, are
        in love with the Formless Lord. They abandon the tastes of Maya,
        and gather in the infinite wealth of the Naam. Twenty-four hours
        a day, they are lovingly absorbed in the One Lord; they surrender
        and accept the Will of the Infinite Lord. <br>

      <p> Servant Nanak begs for this one gift: please bless me, Lord, with
        the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; my mind is in love with You.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  One who is conscious of You finds everlasting
        peace. One who is conscious of You does not suffer at the hands
        of the Messenger of Death. One who is conscious of You is not
        anxious. One who has the Creator as his Friend - all his
        affairs are resolved. One who is conscious of You is renowned
        and respected. One who is conscious of You becomes very wealthy.
        One who is conscious of You has a great family. One who is conscious
        of You saves his ancestors.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Blind
        inwardly, and blind outwardly, he sings falsely, falsely. He washes
        his body, and draws ritual marks on it, and totally runs after
        wealth. But the filth of his egotism is not removed from within,
        and over and over again, he comes and goes in reincarnation. Engulfed
        in sleep, and tormented by frustrated sexual desire, he chants
        the Lord's Name with his mouth. He is called a Vaishnav,
        but he is bound to deeds of egotism; by threshing only husks,
        what rewards can be obtained? Sitting among the swans, the crane
        does not become one of them; sitting there, he keeps staring at
        the fish. And when the gathering of swans looks and sees, they
        realize that they can never form an alliance with the crane. The
        swans peck at the diamonds and pearls, while the crane chases
        after frogs. The poor crane flies away, so that his secret will
        not be exposed. Whatever the Lord attaches one to, to that he
        is attached. Who is to blame, when the Lord wills it so? The True
        Guru is the lake, overflowing with pearls. One who meets the True
        Guru obtains them. The Sikh-swans gather at the lake, according
        to the Will of the True Guru. The lake is filled with the wealth
        of these jewels and pearls; they are spent and consumed, but they
        never run out. The swan never leaves the lake; such is the Pleasure
        of the Creator's Will. O servant Nanak, one who has such
        pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead - that
        Sikh comes to the Guru. He saves himself, and saves all his generations
        as well; he emancipates the whole world.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        He is called a Pandit, a religious scholar, and yet he wanders
        along many pathways. He is as hard as uncooked beans. He is filled
        with attachment, and constantly engrossed in doubt; his body cannot
        hold still. False is his coming, and false is his going; he is
        continually on the lookout for Maya. If someone speaks the truth,
        then he is aggravated; he is totally filled with anger. The evil
        fool is engrossed in evil-mindedness and false intellectualizations;
        his mind is attached to emotional attachment. The deceiver abides
        with the five deceivers; it is a gathering of like minds. And
        when the Jeweller, the True Guru, appraises him, then he is exposed
        as mere iron. Mixed and mingled with others, he was passed off
        as genuine in many places; but now, the veil has been lifted,
        and he stands naked before all. One who comes to the Sanctuary
        of the True Guru, shall be transformed from iron into gold. The
        True Guru has no anger or vengeance; He looks upon son and enemy
        alike. Removing faults and mistakes, He purifies the human body. <br>

      <p> O Nanak, one who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon
        his forehead, is in love with the True Guru. The Word of the Perfect
        True Guru's Bani is Ambrosial Nectar; it dwells in the
        heart of one who is blessed by the Guru's Mercy. His coming
        and going in reincarnation is ended; forever and ever, he is at
        peace.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He alone understands You, Lord, with
        whom You are pleased. He alone is approved in the Court of the
        Lord, with whom You are pleased. Egotism is eradicated, when You
        bestow Your Grace. Sinful residues are erased, when You are thoroughly
        pleased. One who has the Lord Master on his side, becomes fearless.
        One who is blessed with Your Mercy, becomes truthful. One who
        is blessed with Your Kindness, is not touched by fire. You are
        forever Merciful to those who are receptive to the Guru's
        Teachings.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Please grant Your
        Grace, O Merciful Lord; please forgive me. Forever and ever, I
        chant Your Name; I fall at the feet of the True Guru. Please,
        dwell within my mind and body, and end my sufferings. Please give
        me Your hand, and save me, that fear may not afflict me. May I
        sing Your Glorious Praises day and night; please commit me to
        this task. Associating with the humble Saints, the disease of
        egotism is eradicated. The One Lord and Master is all-pervading,
        permeating everywhere. By Guru's Grace, I have truly found
        the Truest of the True. Please bless me with Your Kindness, O
        Kind Lord, and bless me with Your Praises. Gazing upon the Blessed
        Vision of Your Darshan, I am in ecstasy; this is what Nanak loves.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate on the One Lord within your mind,
        and enter the Sanctuary of the One Lord alone. Be in love with
        the One Lord; there is no other at all. Beg from the One Lord,
        the Great Giver, and you will be blessed with everything. In your
        mind and body, with each breath and morsel of food, meditate on
        the One and only Lord God. The Gurmukh obtains the true treasure,
        the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. Very fortunate are those
        humble Saints, within whose minds the Lord has come to abide.
        He is pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky;
        there is no other at all. Meditating on the Naam, and chanting
        the Naam, Nanak abides in the Will of his Lord and Master.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  One who has You as his Saving Grace - who
        can kill him? One who has You as his Saving Grace conquers the
        three worlds. One who has You on his side - his face is
        radiant and bright. One who has You on his side, is the purest
        of the Pure. One who is blessed with Your Grace is not called
        to give his account. One with whom You are pleased, obtains the
        nine treasures. One who has You on his side, God - unto
        whom is he subservient? One who is blessed with Your Kind Mercy
        is dedicated to Your worship.  || 8 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Be Merciful, O my Lord and Master, that I may pass my life in
        the Society of the Saints. Those who forget You are born only
        to die and be reincarnated again; their sufferings will never
        end.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate in remembrance within your
        heart on the True Guru, whether you are on the most difficult
        path, on the mountain or by the river bank. Chanting the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har, no one shall block your way.  || 2 ||

      <p> Where You are, Almighty Lord, there is no one else. There, in
        the fire of the mother's womb, You protected us. Hearing
        Your Name, the Messenger of Death runs away. The terrifying, treacherous,
        impassible world-ocean is crossed over, through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad. Those who feel thirst for You, take in Your
        Ambrosial Nectar. This is the only act of goodness in this Dark
        Age of Kali Yuga, to sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of
        the Universe. He is Merciful to all; He sustains us with each
        and every breath. Those who come to You with love and faith are
        never turned away empty-handed.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Those whom You bless with the Support of Your Name, O Supreme
        Lord God, do not know any other. Inaccessible, Unfathomable Lord
        and Master, All-powerful True Great Giver: You are eternal and
        unchanging, without vengeance and True; True is the Darbaar of
        Your Court. Your worth cannot be described; You have no end or
        limitation. To forsake God, and ask for something else, is all
        corruption and ashes. They alone find peace, and they are the
        true kings, whose dealings are true. Those who are in love with
        God's Name, intuitively enjoy the essence of peace. Nanak
        worships and adores the One Lord; he seeks the dust of the Saints.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises, bliss, peace and rest are obtained. Forsake other clever
        tricks, O Nanak; only through the Name will you be saved.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  No one can bring You under control, by despising
        the world. No one can bring You under control, by studying the
        Vedas. No one can bring You under control, by wandering all over
        the world. No one can bring You under control, by any clever tricks.
        No one can bring You under control, by giving huge donations to
        charities. Everyone is under Your power, O inaccessible, unfathomable
        Lord. You are under the control of Your devotees; You are the
        strength of Your devotees.  || 10 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        Lord Himself is the true physician. These physicians of the world
        only burden the soul with pain. The Word of the Guru's
        Shabad is Ambrosial Nectar; it is so delicious to eat. O Nanak,
        one whose mind is filled with this Nectar - all his pains
        are dispelled.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  By the Hukam of Lord's
        Command, they move about; by the Lord's Command, they remain
        still. By His Hukam, they endure pain and pleasure alike. By His
        Hukam, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, day and night.
        O Nanak, he alone does so, who is blessed. By the Hukam of the
        Lord's Command, they die; by the Hukam of His Command,
        they live. By His Hukam, they become tiny, and huge. By His Hukam,
        they receive pain, happiness and bliss. By His Hukam, they chant
        the Guru's Mantra, which always works. By His Hukam, coming
        and going in reincarnation cease, O Nanak, when He links them
        to His devotional worship.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  I am a sacrifice
        to that musician who is Your servant, O Lord. I am a sacrifice
        to that musician who sings the Glorious Praises of the Infinite
        Lord. Blessed, blessed is that musician, for whom the Formless
        Lord Himself longs. Very fortunate is that musician who comes
        to the gate of the Court of the True Lord. That musician meditates
        on You, Lord, and praises You day and night. He begs for the Ambrosial
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, and will never be defeated. His clothes
        and his food are true, and he enshrines love for the Lord within. <br>

        FIFTH MEHL:  The Bani of the Guru's Word is Ambrosial
        Nectar; its taste is sweet. The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial
        Nectar. Meditate in remembrance on the Lord in your mind, body
        and heart; twenty-four hours a day, sing His Glorious Praises.
        Listen to these Teachings, O Sikhs of the Guru. This is the true
        purpose of life. This priceless human life will be made fruitful;
        embrace love for the Lord in your mind. Celestial peace and absolute
        bliss come when one meditates on God - suffering is dispelled.
        O Nanak, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, peace wells
        up, and one obtains a place in the Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord; this is the Teaching imparted by the Perfect Guru. In the
        Lord's Will, they practice meditation, austerity and self-discipline;
        in the Lord's Will, they are released. In the Lord's
        Will, they are made to wander in reincarnation; in the Lord's
        Will, they are forgiven. In the Lord's Will, pain and pleasure
        are experienced; in the Lord's Will, actions are performed.
        In the Lord's Will, clay is fashioned into form; in the
        Lord's Will, His Light is infused into it. In the Lord's
        Will, enjoyments are enjoyed; in the Lord's Will, these
        enjoyments are denied. In the Lord's Will, they are incarnated
        in heaven and hell; in the Lord's Will, they fall to the
        ground. In the Lord's Will, they are committed to His devotional
        worship and Praise; O Nanak, how rare are these!  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Hearing, hearing of the glorious greatness of the True Name,
        I live. Even ignorant beasts and goblins can be saved, in an instant.
        Day and night, chant the Name, forever and ever. The most horrible
        thirst and hunger is satisfied through Your Name, O Lord. Disease,
        sorrow and pain run away, when the Name dwells within the mind.
        He alone attains his Beloved, who loves the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. The worlds and solar systems are saved by the Infinite
        Lord. Your glory is Yours alone, O my Beloved True Lord.  || 12
        ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  I abandoned and lost my Beloved Friend,
        O Nanak; I was fooled by the transitory color of the safflower,
        which fades away. I did not know Your value, O my Friend; without
        You, I am not worth even half a shell.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        My mother-in-law is my enemy, O Nanak; my father-in-law is argumentative
        and my brother-in-law burns me at every step. They can all just
        play in the dust, when You are my Friend, O Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        You relieve the pains of those, within whose consciousness You
        dwell, O Lord. Those, within whose consciousness You dwell, never
        lose. One who meets the Perfect Guru will surely be saved. One
        who is attached to Truth, contemplates Truth. One, into whose
        hands the treasure comes, stops searching. He alone is known as
        a devotee, who loves the One Lord. He is the dust under the feet
        of all; he is the lover of the Lord's feet. Everything
        is Your wonderful play; the whole creation is Yours.  || 13 ||
        SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have totally discarded praise and slander,
        O Nanak; I have forsaken and abandoned everything. I have seen
        that all relationships are false, and so I have grasped hold of
        the hem of Your robe, Lord.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  I wandered
        and wandered and went crazy, O Nanak, in countless foreign lands
        and pathways. </p>
