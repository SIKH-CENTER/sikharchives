      <p> || 5 ||   My comings and goings have ended; the Formless Lord
        now dwells within my mind. His limits cannot be found; He is lofty
        and exalted, inaccessible and infinite. One who forgets His God,
        shall die and be reincarnated, hundreds of thousands of times.
        || 6 ||   They alone bear true love for their God, within whose
        minds He Himself dwells. So dwell only with those who share their
        virtues; chant and meditate on God, twenty-four hours a day. They
        are attuned to the Love of the Transcendent Lord; all their sorrows
        and afflictions are dispelled.  || 7 ||   You are the Creator,
        You are the Cause of causes; You are the One and the many. You
        are All-powerful, You are present everywhere; You are the subtle
        intellect, the clear wisdom. Nanak chants and meditates forever
        on the Naam, the Support of the humble devotees.  || 8 || 1 ||

        repenting.  || 1 ||   I shall never leave my Husband Lord's
        side. My Beloved Lover is always and forever beautiful. He is
        my hope and inspiration.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are my Best
        Friend; You are my relative. I am so proud of You. And when You
        dwell within me, I am at peace. I am without honor - You
        are my honor.  || 2 ||   And when You are pleased with me, O treasure
        of mercy, then I do not see any other. Please grant me this blessing,
        that that I may forever dwell upon You and cherish You within
        my heart.  || 3 ||   Let my feet walk on Your Path, and let my
        eyes behold the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. With my ears,
        I will listen to Your Sermon, if the Guru becomes merciful to

        me with Your Glance of Grace, even for an instant; please bless
        me with Your Darshan, that I may revel in Your Love.  || 6 ||
        Seeing Him, my mind is comforted and consoled, and my sins and
        mistakes are far removed. How could I ever forget Him, O my mother?
        He is permeating and pervading everywhere.  || 7 ||   In humility,
        I bowed down in surrender to Him, and He naturally met me. I have
        received what was pre-ordained for me, O Nanak, with the help
        and assistance of the Saints.  || 8 || 1 || 4 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The Simritees, the Vedas, the Puraanas and the other holy
        scriptures proclaim that without the Naam, everything is false
        and worthless.  || 1 ||   The infinite treasure of the Naam abides
        within the minds of the devotees. Birth and death, attachment
        and suffering, are erased in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who indulge in attachment,
        conflict and egotism shall surely weep and cry. Those who are
        separated from the Naam shall never find any peace.  || 2 || 
        Crying out, &quot;Mine! Mine!&quot;, he is bound in bondage.
        Entangled in Maya, he is reincarnated in heaven and hell.  ||
        3 ||   Searching, searching, searching, I have come to understand
        the essence of reality. Without the Naam, there is no peace at
        all, and the mortal will surely fail. <br>

      <p> || 4 ||   Many come and go; they die, and die again, and are reincarnated.
        Without understanding, they are totally useless, and they wander
        in reincarnation.  || 5 ||   They alone join the Saadh Sangat,
        unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful. They chant and meditate on
        the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.  || 6 ||   Uncounted millions,
        so many they are endless, search for Him. But only that one, who
        understands his own self, sees God near at hand.  || 7 ||   Never
        forget me, O Great Giver - please bless me with Your Naam.To
        sing Your Glorious Praises day and night - O Nanak, this
        is my heart-felt desire.  || 8 || 2 || 5 || 16 || </p>

        endless faults. How can I go to enjoy my Husband Lord? Each of
        His soul-brides is better than the rest - who even knows
        my name? Those brides who enjoy their Husband Lord are very blessed,
        resting in the shade of the mango tree. I do not have their virtue
        - who can I blame for this? Which of Your Virtues, O Lord,
        should I speak of? Which of Your Names should I chant? I cannot
        even reach one of Your Virtues. I am forever a sacrifice to You.
        Gold, silver, pearls and rubies are pleasing. My Husband Lord
        has blessed me with these things, and I have focused my thoughts
        on them. Palaces of brick and mud are built and decorated with
        stones; I have been fooled by these decorations, and I do not
        sit near my Husband Lord. The cranes shriek overhead in the sky,
        and the herons have come to rest. The bride has gone to her father-in-law's
        house; in the world hereafter, what face will she show? She kept
        sleeping as the day dawned; she forgot all about her journey.
        She separated herself from her Husband Lord, and now she suffers
        in pain. Virtue is in You, O Lord; I am totally without virtue.
        This is Nanak's only prayer: You give all Your nights to
        the virtuous soul-brides. I know I am unworthy, but isn't
        there a night for me as well?  || 1 ||   SOOHEE,  FIRST MEHL,

        then I have everything. O my Lord and Master, You are my wealth
        and capital. Within You, I abide in peace; within You, I am congratulated.
        By the Pleasure of Your Will, You bestow thrones and greatness.
        And by the Pleasure of Your Will, You make us beggars and wanderers.
        By the Pleasure of Your Will, the ocean flows in the desert, and
        the lotus blossoms in the sky. By the Pleasure of Your Will, one
        crosses over the terrifying world-ocean; by the Pleasure of Your
        Will, he sinks down into it. By the Pleasure of His Will, that
        Lord becomes my Husband, and I am imbued with the Praises of the
        Lord, the treasure of virtue. By the Pleasure of Your Will, O
        my Husband Lord, I am afraid of You, and I come and go, and die.
        You, O my Husband Lord, are inaccessible and immeasurable; talking
        and speaking of You, I have fallen at Your Feet. What should I
        beg for? What should I say and hear? I am hungry and thirsty for
        the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Teachings, I have found my Husband Lord. <br>

      <p> This is Nanak's true prayer.  || 2 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH
        MEHL,  GUNVANTEE  ~  THE WORTHY AND VIRTUOUS BRIDE:  When I see
        a Sikh of the Guru, I humbly bow and fall at his feet. I tell
        to him the pain of my soul, and beg him to unite me with the Guru,
        my Best Friend. I ask that he impart to me such an understanding,
        that my mind will not go out wandering anywhere else. I dedicate
        this mind to you. Please, show me the Path to God. I have come
        so far, seeking the Protection of Your Sanctuary. Within my mind,
        I place my hopes in You; please, take my pain and suffering away!
        So walk on this Path, O sister soul-brides; do that work which
        the Guru tells you to do. Abandon the intellectual pursuits of
        the mind, and forget the love of duality. In this way, you shall
        obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; the hot
        winds shall not even touch you. By myself, I do not even know
        how to speak; I speak all that the Lord commands. I am blessed
        with the treasure of the Lord's devotional worship; Guru
        Nanak has been kind and compassionate to me. I shall never again
        feel hunger or thirst; I am satisfied, satiated and fulfilled.
        When I see a Sikh of the Guru, I humbly bow and fall at his feet.

        (in this world). My consciousness is polluted with faults and
        mistakes; without the Guru, virtue does not even enter into me.
        I have not known the value of virtue; I have been deluded by doubt.
        I have wasted away my youth in vain. I have not known my Husband
        Lord, His celestial home and gate, or the Blessed Vision of His
        Darshan. I have not had the pleasure of my Husband Lord's
        celestial peace. After consulting the True Guru, I have not walked
        on the Path; the night of my life is passing away in sleep. O
        Nanak, in the prime of my youth, I am a widow; without my Husband
        Lord, the soul-bride is wasting away.  || 1 ||   O father, give
        me in marriage to the Lord; I am pleased with Him as my Husband.
        I belong to Him. He is pervading throughout the four ages, and
        the Word of His Bani permeates the three worlds. The Husband Lord
        of the three worlds ravishes and enjoys His virtuous brides, but
        He keeps the ungraceful and unvirtuous ones far away. As are our
        hopes, so are our minds' desires, which the All-pervading
        Lord brings to fulfillment. The bride of the Lord is forever happy
        and virtuous; she shall never be a widow, and she shall never
        have to wear dirty clothes. O Nanak, I love my True Husband Lord;
        my Beloved is the same, age after age.  || 2 ||   O Baba, calculate
        that auspicious moment, when I too shall be going to my in-laws'
        house. The moment of that marriage will be set by the Hukam of
        God's Command; His Will cannot be changed. The karmic record
        of past deeds, written by the Creator Lord, cannot be erased by
        anyone. The most respected member of the marriage party, my Husband,
        is the independent Lord of all beings, pervading and permeating
        the three worlds. Maya, crying out in pain, leaves, seeing that
        the bride and the groom are in love. <br>

        in marriage far away, and I shall not return to my parents'
        home. I am delighted to see my Husband Lord near at hand; in His
        Home, I am so beautiful. My True Beloved Husband Lord desires
        me; He has joined me to Himself, and made my intellect pure and
        sublime. By good destiny I met Him, and was given a place of rest;
        through the Guru's Wisdom, I have become virtuous. I gather
        lasting Truth and contentment in my lap, and my Beloved is pleased
        with my truthful speech. O Nanak, I shall not suffer the pain
        of separation; through the Guru's Teachings, I merge into
        the loving embrace of the Lord's Being.  || 4 || 1 || </p>

        My mind and body are drenched with Ambrosial Nectar; deep within
        the nucleus of my self, is the jewel of the Lord's Love.
        This invaluable jewel is deep within me; I contemplate the supreme
        essence of reality. Living beings are mere beggars; You are the
        Giver of rewards; You are the Giver to each and every being. You
        are Wise and All-knowing, the Inner-knower; You Yourself created
        the creation. So listen, O my sisters - the Enticer has
        enticed my mind. My body and mind are drenched with Nectar.  ||
        3 ||   O Supreme Soul of the World, Your play is true. Your play
        is true, O Inaccessible and Infinite Lord; without You, who can
        make me understand? There are millions of Siddhas and enlightened
        seekers, but without You, who can call himself one? Death and
        rebirth drive the mind insane; only the Guru can hold it in its
        place. O Nanak, one who burns away his demerits and faults with
        the Shabad, accumulates virtue, and finds God.  || 4 || 1 || 2

      <p> Your Light is in everyone; through it, You are known. Through
        love, You are easily met. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to my Friend;
        He has come home to meet with those who are true.  || 1 ||   When
        her Friend comes to her home, the bride is very pleased. She is
        fascinated with the True Word of the Lord's Shabad; gazing
        upon her Lord and Master, she is filled with joy. She is filled
        with virtuous joy, and is totally pleased, when she is ravished
        and enjoyed by her Lord, and imbued with His Love. Her faults
        and demerits are eradicated, and she roofs her home with virtue,
        through the Perfect Lord, the Architect of Destiny. Conquering
        the thieves, she dwells as the mistress of her home, and administers
        justice wisely. O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, she is
        emancipated; through the Guru's Teachings, she meets her
        Beloved.  || 2 ||   The young bride has found her Husband Lord;
        her hopes and desires are fulfilled. She enjoys and ravishes her
        Husband Lord, and blends into the Word of the Shabad, pervading
        and permeating everywhere; the Lord is not far away. God is not
        far away; He is in each and every heart. All are His brides. He
        Himself is the Enjoyer, He Himself ravishes and enjoys; this is
        His glorious greatness. He is imperishable, immovable, invaluable
        and infinite. The True Lord is obtained through the Perfect Guru.
        O Nanak, He Himself unites in Union; by His Glance of Grace, He
        lovingly attunes them to Himself.  || 3 ||   My Husband Lord dwells
        in the loftiest balcony; He is the Supreme Lord of the three worlds.
        I am amazed, gazing upon His glorious excellence; the unstruck
        sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resonates. I contemplate
        the Shabad, and perform sublime deeds; I am blessed with the insignia,
        the banner of the Lord's Name. Without the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, the false find no place of rest; only the jewel of
        the Naam brings acceptance and renown. Perfect is my honor, perfect
        is my intellect and password. I shall not have to come or go.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands her own self; she becomes like
        her Imperishable Lord God.  || 4 || 1 || 3 || <br>

        O Lord, illuminate the heart, and the moon casts its light on
        the body. The moon glows, by the Lord's gift, and the darkness
        of suffering is taken away. The marriage party of virtue looks
        beautiful with the Groom; He chooses His enticing bride with care.
        The wedding is performed with glorious splendor; He has arrived,
        accompanied by the vibrations of the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal
        Sounds. The One who created the world, watches over it; He enjoins
        the people of the world to their tasks.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice
        to my pure friends, the immaculate Saints. This body is attached
        to them, and we have shared our minds. We have shared our minds
        - how could I forget those friends? Seeing them brings
        joy to my heart; I keep them clasped to my soul. They have all
        virtues and merits, forever and ever; they have no demerits or
        faults at all. I am a sacrifice to my pure friends, the immaculate
        Saints.  || 2 ||   One who has a basket of fragrant virtues, should

      <p> If my friends have virtues, I will share in them. Let us form
        a partnership, and share our virtues; let us abandon our faults,
        and walk on the Path. Let us wear our virtues like silk clothes;
        let us decorate ourselves, and enter the arena. Let us speak of
        goodness, wherever we go and sit; let us skim off the Ambrosial
        Nectar, and drink it in. One who has a basket of fragrant virtues,
        should enjoy its fragrance.  || 3 ||   He Himself acts; unto whom
        should we complain? No one else does anything. Go ahead and complain
        to Him, if He makes a mistake. If He makes a mistake, go ahead
        and complain to Him; but how can the Creator Himself make a mistake?
        He sees, He hears, and without our asking, without our begging,
        He gives His gifts. The Great Giver, the Architect of the Universe,
        gives His gifts. O Nanak, He is the True Lord. He Himself acts;
        unto whom should we complain? No one else does anything.  || 4
        || 1 || 4 ||   SOOHEE,  FIRST MEHL:  My mind is imbued with His
        Glorious Praises; I chant them, and He is pleasing to my mind.
        Truth is the ladder to the Guru; climbing up to the True Lord,
        peace is obtained. Celestial peace comes; the Truth pleases me.
        How could these True Teachings ever be erased? He Himself is Undeceivable;
        how could He ever be deceived by cleansing baths, charity, spiritual
        wisdom or ritual bathings? Fraud, attachment and corruption are
        taken away, as are falsehood, hypocrisy and duality. My mind is
        imbued with His Glorious Praises; I chant them, and He is pleasing
        to my mind.  || 1 ||   So praise your Lord and Master, who created
        the creation. Filth sticks to the polluted mind; how rare are
        those who drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. Churn this Ambrosial
        Nectar, and drink it in; dedicate this mind to the Guru, and He
        will value it highly. I intuitively realized my God, when I linked
        my mind to the True Lord. I will sing the Lord's Glorious
        Praises with Him, if it pleases Him; how could I meet Him by being
        a stranger to Him? So praise your Lord and Master, who created
        the creation.  || 2 ||   When He comes, what else remains behind?
        How can there be any coming or going then? When the mind is reconciled
        with its Beloved Lord, it is blended with Him. True is the speech
        of one who is imbued with the Love of his Lord and Master, who
        fashioned the body fortress from a mere bubble. He is the Master
        of the five elements; He Himself is the Creator Lord. He embellished
        the body with Truth. I am worthless; please hear me, O my Beloved!
        Whatever pleases You is True. One who is blessed with true understanding,
        does not come and go.  || 3 ||   Apply such an ointment to your
        eyes, which is pleasing to your Beloved. I realize, understand
        and know Him, only if He Himself causes me to know Him. He Himself
        shows me the Way, and He Himself leads me to it, attracting my
        mind. He Himself causes us to do good and bad deeds; who can know
        the value of the Mysterious Lord? I know nothing of Tantric spells,
        magical mantras and hypocritical rituals; enshrining the Lord
        within my heart, my mind is satisfied. The ointment of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, is only understood by one who realizes the
        Lord, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 4 || 
        I have my own friends; why should I go to the home of a stranger?
        My friends are imbued with the True Lord; He is with them, in
        their minds. <br>

      <p> In their minds, these friends celebrate in happiness; all good
        karma, righteousness and Dharma, the sixty-eight holy places of
        pilgrimage, charity and worship, are found in the love of the
        True Name. He Himself creates, establishes and beholds all, by
        the Pleasure of His Will. My friends are happy in the Love of
        the Lord; they nurture love for their Beloved.  || 5 ||   If a
        blind man is made the leader, how will he know the way? He is
        impaired, and his understanding is inadequate; how will he know
        the way? How can he follow the path and reach the Mansion of the
        Lord's Presence? Blind is the understanding of the blind.
        Without the Lord's Name, they cannot see anything; the
        blind are drowned in worldly entanglements. Day and night, the
        Divine Light shines forth and joy wells up, when the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad abides in the mind. With your palms pressed
        together, pray to the Guru to show you the way.  || 6 ||   If
        the man becomes a stranger to God, then all the world becomes
        a stranger to him. Unto whom should I tie up and give the bundle
        of my pains? The whole world is overflowing with pain and suffering;
        who can know the state of my inner self? Comings and goings are
        terrible and dreadful; there is no end to the rounds of reincarnation.
        Without the Naam, he is vacant and sad; he does not listen to
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. If the mind becomes a stranger
        to God, then all the world becomes a stranger to him.  || 7 ||
        One who finds the Guru's Mansion within the home of his
        own being, merges in the All-pervading Lord. The sevadar performs
        selfless service when he is pleased, and confirmed in the True
        Word of the Shabad. Confirmed in the Shabad, with her being softened
        by devotion, the bride dwells in the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, deep within her being. The Creator Himself creates;
        God Himself, in the end, is endless. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, the mortal is united, and then embellished; the unstruck
        melody of the sound current resounds. One who finds the Guru's
        Mansion within the home of his own being, merges in the All-pervading
        Lord.  || 8 ||   Why praise that which is created? Praise instead
        the One who created it and watches over it. His value cannot be
        estimated, no matter how much one may wish. He alone can estimate
        the Lord's value, whom the Lord Himself causes to know.
        He is not mistaken; He does not make mistakes. He alone celebrates
        victory, who is pleasing to You, through the Invaluable Word of
        the Guru's Shabad. I am lowly and abject - I offer
        my prayer; may I never forsake the True Name, O Sibling of Destiny.
        O Nanak, the One who created the creation, watches over it; He
        alone bestows understanding.  || 9 || 2 || 5 || <br>

        it, unto whom the Lord shows Mercy. In peace and poise, he sings
        the Lord's Praises day and night, and all sinful residues
        are eradicated. All are Yours, and You belong to all. I am Yours,
        and You are mine. In this age, emancipation comes only from the

        Those who burn away their ego through the Shabad, become pleasing

        world suffers the pains of death and rebirth, and through the
        love of duality, it is ruined; without the Guru, the essence of
        reality is not known. <br>

        O Nanak, through the Naam, greatness is obtained; in the love

        is the joy of true marriage; they chant the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord forever. He Himself blesses them with the treasure of
        devotion; conquering the thorny pain of death, they merge in the
        Lord. Conquering the thorny pain of death, they merge in the Lord;
        they are pleasing to the Lord's Mind, and they obtain the
        true treasure of the Naam. This treasure is inexhaustible; it
        will never be exhausted. The Lord automatically blesses them with
        it. The humble servants of the Lord are exalted and elevated,
        forever on high; they are adorned with the Word of the Guru's

        2 ||   SOOHEE,  THIRD MEHL:  Through the True Word of the Shabad,
        true happiness prevails, there where the True Lord is contemplated.
        Egotism and all sinful residues are eradicated, when one keeps
        the True Lord enshrined in the heart. One who keeps the True Lord
        enshrined in the heart, crosses over the terrible and dreadful
        world-ocean; he shall not have to cross over it again. True is
        the True Guru, and True is the Word of His Bani; through it, the
        True Lord is seen. One who sings the Glorious Praises of the True
        Lord merges in Truth; he beholds the True Lord everywhere. O Nanak,
        True is the Lord and Master, and True is His Name; through Truth,
        comes emancipation.  || 1 ||   The True Guru reveals the True
        Lord; the True Lord preserves our honor. The true food is love
        for the True Lord; through the True Name, peace is obtained. Through
        the True Name, the mortal finds peace; he shall never die, and
        never again enter the womb of reincarnation. His light blends
        with the Light, and he merges into the True Lord; he is illuminated
        and enlightened with the True Name. Those who know the Truth are
        True; night and day, they meditate on Truth. O Nanak, those whose
        hearts are filled with the True Name, never suffer the pains of
        separation.  || 2 ||   In that home, and in that heart, where
        the True Bani of the Lord's True Praises are sung, the
        songs of joy resound. Through the immaculate virtues of the True
        Lord, the body and mind are rendered True, and God, the True Primal
        Being, dwells within. Such a person practices only Truth, and
        speaks only Truth; whatever the True Lord does, that alone comes
        to pass. Wherever I look, there I see the True Lord pervading;
        there is no other at all. From the True Lord, we emanate, and
        into the True Lord, we shall merge; death and birth come from
        duality. O Nanak, He Himself does everything; He Himself is the
        Cause.  || 3 ||   The true devotees look beautiful in the Darbaar
        of the Lord's Court. They speak Truth, and only Truth.
        Deep within the nucleus of their heart, is the True Word of the
        Lord's Bani. Through the Truth, they understand themselves.

        his forehead.  || 4 || 2 || 3 ||   SOOHEE,  THIRD MEHL:  The soul-bride
        may wander throughout the four ages, but still, without the True
        Guru, she will not find her True Husband Lord. <br>
