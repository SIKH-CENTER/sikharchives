      <p> In the forests, fields and mountains, He is the Supreme Lord God.
        As He orders, so do His creatures act. He permeates the winds
        and the waters. He is pervading in the four corners and in the
        ten directions. Without Him, there is no place at all. By Guru's
        Grace, O Nanak, peace is obtained.  || 2 ||   See Him in the Vedas,
        the Puraanas and the Simritees. In the moon, the sun and the stars,
        He is the One. The Bani of God's Word is spoken by everyone.
        He Himself is unwavering  -  He never wavers. With absolute
        power, He plays His play. His value cannot be estimated; His virtues
        are invaluable. In all light, is His Light. The Lord and Master
        supports the weave of the fabric of the universe. By Guru's
        Grace, doubt is dispelled. O Nanak, this faith is firmly implanted
        within.  || 3 ||   In the eye of the Saint, everything is God.
        In the heart of the Saint, everything is Dharma. The Saint hears
        words of goodness. He is absorbed in the All-pervading Lord. This
        is the way of life of one who knows God. True are all the words
        spoken by the Holy. Whatever happens, he peacefully accepts. He
        knows God as the Doer, the Cause of causes. He dwells inside,
        and outside as well. O Nanak, beholding the Blessed Vision of
        His Darshan, all are fascinated.  || 4 ||   He Himself is True,
        and all that He has made is True. The entire creation came from
        God. As it pleases Him, He creates the expanse. As it pleases
        Him, He becomes the One and Only again. His powers are so numerous,
        they cannot be known. As it pleases Him, He merges us into Himself
        again. Who is near, and who is far away? He Himself is Himself
        pervading everywhere. One whom God causes to know that He is within
        the heart  -  O Nanak, He causes that person to understand
        Him.  || 5 ||   In all forms, He Himself is pervading. Through
        all eyes, He Himself is watching. All the creation is His Body.
        He Himself listens to His Own Praise. The One has created the
        drama of coming and going. He made Maya subservient to His Will.
        In the midst of all, He remains unattached. Whatever is said,
        He Himself says. By His Will we come, and by His Will we go. O
        Nanak, when it pleases Him, then He absorbs us into Himself. 
        || 6 ||   If it comes from Him, it cannot be bad. Other than Him,
        who can do anything? He Himself is good; His actions are the very
        best. He Himself knows His Own Being. He Himself is True, and
        all that He has established is True. Through and through, He is
        blended with His creation. His state and extent cannot be described.
        If there were another like Him, then only he could understand
        Him. His actions are all approved and accepted. By Guru's
        Grace, O Nanak, this is known.  || 7 ||   One who knows Him, obtains
        everlasting peace. God blends that one into Himself. He is wealth
        and prosperous, and of noble birth. He is Jivan Mukta  -  liberated
        while yet alive; the Lord God abides in his heart. </p>

      <p> Blessed, blessed, blessed is the coming of that humble being;
        by his grace, the whole world is saved. This is his purpose in
        life; in the Company of this humble servant, the Lord's Name
        comes to mind. He Himself is liberated, and He liberates the universe.
        O Nanak, to that humble servant, I bow in reverence forever. 
        || 8 || 23 ||   SHALOK:  I worship and adore the Perfect Lord
        God. Perfect is His Name. O Nanak, I have obtained the Perfect
        One; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Perfect Lord.  || 1 ||
        ASHTAPADEE:  Listen to the Teachings of the Perfect Guru; see
        the Supreme Lord God near you. With each and every breath, meditate
        in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe, and the anxiety within
        your mind shall depart. Abandon the waves of fleeting desire,
        and pray for the dust of the feet of the Saints. Renounce your
        selfishness and conceit and offer your prayers. In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, cross over the ocean of fire. Fill your
        stores with the wealth of the Lord. Nanak bows in humility and
        reverence to the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||   Happiness, intuitive
        peace, poise and bliss  -  in the Company of the Holy, meditate
        on the Lord of supreme bliss. You shall be spared from hell  - 
        save your soul! Drink in the ambrosial essence of the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Focus your consciousness
        on the One, the All-pervading Lord  -  He has One Form, but
        He has many manifestations. Sustainer of the Universe, Lord of
        the world, Kind to the poor, Destroyer of sorrow, perfectly Merciful.
        Meditate, meditate in remembrance on the Naam, again and again.
        O Nanak, it is the Support of the soul.  || 2 ||   The most sublime
        hymns are the Words of the Holy. These are priceless rubies and
        gems. One who listens and acts on them is saved. He himself swims
        across, and saves others as well. His life is prosperous, and
        his company is fruitful; his mind is imbued with the love of the
        Lord. Hail, hail to him, for whom the sound current of the Shabad
        vibrates. Hearing it again and again, he is in bliss, proclaiming
        God's Praises. The Lord radiates from the foreheads of the
        Holy. Nanak is saved in their company.  || 3 ||   Hearing that
        He can give Sanctuary, I have come seeking His Sanctuary. Bestowing
        His Mercy, God has blended me with Himself. Hatred is gone, and
        I have become the dust of all. I have received the Ambrosial Naam
        in the Company of the Holy. The Divine Guru is perfectly pleased;
        the service of His servant has been rewarded. I have been released
        from worldly entanglements and corruption, hearing the Lord's
        Name and chanting it with my tongue. By His Grace, God has bestowed
        His Mercy. O Nanak, my merchandise has arrived save and sound.
        || 4 ||   Sing the Praises of God, O Saints, O friends, with
        total concentration and one-pointedness of mind. Sukhmani is the
        peaceful ease, the Glory of God, the Naam. When it abides in the
        mind, one becomes wealthy. All desires are fulfilled. One becomes
        the most respected person, famous all over the world. He obtains
        the highest place of all. He does not come and go in reincarnation
        any longer. One who departs, after earning the wealth of the Lord's
        Name, O Nanak, realizes it.  || 5 ||   Comfort, peace and tranquility,
        wealth and the nine treasures; wisdom, knowledge, and all spiritual
        powers; learning, penance, Yoga and meditation on God; </p>

      <p> The most sublime wisdom and purifying baths; the four cardinal
        blessings, the opening of the heart-lotus; in the midst of all,
        and yet detached from all; beauty, intelligence, and the realization
        of reality; to look impartially upon all, and to see only the
        One  -  these blessings come to one who, through Guru Nanak,
        chants the Naam with his mouth, and hears the Word with his ears.
        || 6 ||   One who chants this treasure in his mind  -  in
        every age, he attains salvation. In it is the Glory of God, the
        Naam, the chanting of Gurbani. The Simritees, the Shaastras and
        the Vedas speak of it. The essence of all religion is the Lord's
        Name alone. It abides in the minds of the devotees of God. Millions
        of sins are erased, in the Company of the Holy. By the Grace of
        the Saint, one escapes the Messenger of Death. Those, who have
        such pre-ordained destiny on their foreheads, O Nanak, enter the
        Sanctuary of the Saints.  || 7 ||   One, within whose mind it
        abides, and who listens to it with love  -  that humble person
        consciously remembers the Lord God. The pains of birth and death
        are removed. The human body, so difficult to obtain, is instantly
        redeemed. Spotlessly pure is his reputation, and ambrosial is
        his speech. The One Name permeates his mind. Sorrow, sickness,
        fear and doubt depart. He is called a Holy person; his actions
        are immaculate and pure. His glory becomes the highest of all.
        O Nanak, by these Glorious Virtues, this is named Sukhmani, Peace
        of mind.  || 8 || 24 || </p>

        T'HITEE ~ THE LUNAR DAYS:  GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL,  SHALOK:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The Creator Lord and Master is pervading the water, the land,
        and the sky. In so many ways, the One, the Universal Creator has
        diffused Himself, O Nanak.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  The first day of
        the lunar cycle:  Bow in humility and meditate on the One, the
        Universal Creator Lord God. Praise God, the Lord of the Universe,
        the Sustainer of the World; seek the Sanctuary of the Lord, our
        King. Place your hopes in Him, for salvation and peace; all things
        come from Him. I wandered around the four corners of the world
        and in the ten directions, but I saw nothing except Him. I listened
        to the Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees, and I pondered over
        them in so many ways. The Saving Grace of sinners, the Destroyer
        of fear, the Ocean of peace, the Formless Lord. The Great Giver,
        the Enjoyer, the Bestower  -  there is no place at all without
        Him. You shall obtain all that you desire, O Nanak, singing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Sing the Praises of the
        Lord, the Lord of the Universe, each and every day. Join the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and vibrate, meditate on Him,
        O my friend.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   SHALOK:  Bow in humility to
        the Lord, over and over again, and enter the Sanctuary of the
        Lord, our King. Doubt is eradicated, O Nanak, in the Company of
        the Holy, and the love of duality is eliminated.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        The second day of the lunar cycle:  Get rid of your evil-mindedness,
        and serve the Guru continually. The jewel of the Lord's Name
        shall come to dwell in your mind and body, when you renounce sexual
        desire, anger and greed, O my friend. Conquer death and obtain
        eternal life; all your troubles will depart. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Renounce your self-conceit and vibrate upon the Lord of the Universe;
        loving devotion to Him shall permeate your being. You shall earn
        profit and suffer no loss, and in the Court of the Lord you shall
        be honored. Those who gather in the riches of the Lord's
        Name are truly wealthy, and very blessed. So, when standing up
        and sitting down, vibrate upon the Lord, and cherish the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy. O Nanak, evil-mindedness is eradicated,
        when the Supreme Lord God comes to dwell in the mind.  || 2 ||
        SHALOK:  The world is in the grip of the three qualities; only
        a few attain the fourth state of absorption. O Nanak, the Saints
        are pure and immaculate; the Lord abides within their minds. 
        || 3 ||   PAUREE:  The third day of the lunar cycle:  Those who
        are bound by the three qualities gather poison as their fruit;
        now they are good, and now they are bad. They wander endlessly
        in heaven and hell, until death annihilates them. In pleasure
        and pain and worldly cynicism, they pass their lives acting in
        ego. They do not know the One who created them; they think up
        all sorts of schemes and plans. Their minds and bodies are distracted
        by pleasure and pain, and their fever never departs. They do not
        realize the glorious radiance of the Supreme Lord God, the Perfect
        Lord and Master. So many are being drowned in emotional attachment
        and doubt; they dwell in the most horrible hell. Please bless
        me with Your Mercy, God, and save me! Nanak places his hopes in
        You.  || 3 ||   SHALOK:  One who renounces egotistical pride is
        intelligent, wise and refined. The four cardinal blessings, and
        the eight spiritual powers of the Siddhas are obtained, O Nanak,
        by meditating, vibrating on the Lord's Name.  || 4 ||   PAUREE:
        The fourth day of the lunar cycle:  Listening to the four Vedas,
        and contemplating the essence of reality, I have come to realize
        that the treasure of all joy and comfort is found in sublime meditation
        on the Lord's Name. One is saved from hell, suffering is
        destroyed, countless pains depart, death is overcome, and one
        escapes the Messenger of Death, by absorption in the Kirtan of
        the Lord's Praises. Fear departs, and one savors the Ambrosial
        Nectar, imbued with the Love of the Formless Lord. Pain, poverty
        and impurity are removed, with the Support of the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. The angels, the seers and the silent sages search
        for the Ocean of peace, the Sustainer of the world. The mind becomes
        pure, and one's face is radiant, O Nanak, when one becomes
        the dust of the feet of the Holy.  || 4 ||   SHALOK:  The five
        evil passions dwell in the mind of one who is engrossed in Maya.
        In the Saadh Sangat, one becomes pure, O Nanak, imbued with the
        Love of God.  || 5 ||   PAUREE:  The fifth day of the lunar cycle:
        They are the self-elect, the most distinguished, who know the
        true nature of the world. The many colors and scents of flowers
        -  all worldly deceptions are transitory and false. People
        do not see, and they do not understand; they do not reflect upon
        anything. The world is pierced through with attachment to tastes
        and pleasures, engrossed in ignorance. Those who perform empty
        religious rituals will be born, only to die again. They wander
        through endless incarnations. They do not meditate in remembrance
        on the Creator Lord; their minds do not understand. By loving
        devotion to the Lord God, you shall not be polluted by Maya at
        all. O Nanak, how rare are those, who are not engrossed in worldly
        entanglements.  || 5 ||   SHALOK:  The six Shaastras proclaim
        Him to be the greatest; He has no end or limitation. The devotees
        look beauteous, O Nanak, when they sing the Glories of God at
        His Door.  || 6 ||   PAUREE:  The sixth day of the lunar cycle:
        The six Shaastras say, and countless Simritees assert, that the
        Supreme Lord God is the most sublime and lofty. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Even the thousand-tongued serpent does not know the limits of
        His Glories. Naarad, the humble beings, Suk and Vyaasa sing the
        Praises of the Lord of the Universe. They are imbued with the
        Lord's essence; united with Him; they are absorbed in devotional
        worship of the Lord God. Emotional attachment, pride and doubt
        are eliminated, when one takes to the Sanctuary of the Merciful
        Lord. His Lotus Feet abide within my mind and body and I am enraptured,
        beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. People reap their
        profits, and suffer no loss, when they embrace love for the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy. They gather in the treasure of
        the Lord, the Ocean of Excellence, O Nanak, by meditating on the
        Naam.  || 6 ||   SHALOK:  In the gathering of the Saints, chant
        the Praises of the Lord, and speak the Truth with love. O Nanak,
        the mind becomes contented, enshrining love for the One Lord.
        || 7 ||   PAUREE:  The seventh day of the lunar cycle:  Gather
        the wealth of the Naam; this is a treasure which shall never be
        exhausted. In the Society of the Saints, He is obtained; He has
        no end or limitations. Renounce your selfishness and conceit,
        and meditate, vibrate on the Lord of the Universe; take to the
        Sanctuary of the Lord, our King. Your pains shall depart  - 
        swim across the terrifying world-ocean, and obtain the fruits
        of your mind's desires. One who meditates on the Lord twenty-four
        hours a day  -  fruitful and blessed is his coming into the
        world. Inwardly and outwardly, realize that the Creator Lord is
        always with you. He is your friend, your companion, your very
        best friend, who imparts the Teachings of the Lord. Nanak is a
        sacrifice to one who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  ||
        7 ||   SHALOK:  Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord twenty-four
        hours a day; renounce other entanglements. The Minister of Death
        cannot even see that person, O Nanak, unto whom God is merciful.
        || 8 ||   PAUREE:  The eighth day of the lunar cycle:  The eight
        spiritual powers of the Siddhas, the nine treasures, all precious
        things, perfect intellect, the opening of the heart-lotus, eternal
        bliss, pure lifestyle, the infallible Mantra, all Dharmic virtues,
        sacred purifying baths, the most lofty and sublime spiritual wisdom
        -  these are obtained by meditating, vibrating upon the Lord,
        Har, Har, in the Company of the Perfect Guru. You shall be saved,
        O Nanak, by lovingly chanting the Lord's Name.  || 8 || 
        SHALOK:  He does not remember the Lord in meditation; he is fascinated
        by the pleasures of corruption. O Nanak, forgetting the Naam,
        he is reincarnated into heaven and hell.  || 9 ||   PAUREE:  The
        ninth day of the lunar cycle:  The nine holes of the body are
        defiled. People do not chant the Lord's Name; instead, they
        practice evil. They commit adultery, slander the Saints, and do
        not listen to even a tiny bita of the Lord's Praise. They
        steal others' wealth for the sake of their own bellies, but
        the fire is not extinguished, and their thirst is not quenched.
        Without serving the Lord, these are their rewards. O Nanak, forgetting
        God, the unfortunate people are born, only to die.  || 9 ||  
        SHALOK:  I have wandered, searching in the ten directions  - 
        wherever I look, there I see Him. The mind comes to be controlled,
        O Nanak, if He grants His Perfect Grace.  || 10 ||   PAUREE: 
        The tenth day of the lunar cycle:  Overpower the ten sensory and
        motor organs; your mind will be content, as you chant the Naam.
        With your ears, hear the Praises of the Lord of the World; with
        your eyes, behold the kind, Holy Saints. With your tongue, sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Infinite Lord. </p>

        feet, work for the Saints. O Nanak, this way of life is obtained
        by God's Grace.  || 10 ||   SHALOK:  Describe the Lord as
        the One, the One and Only. How rare are those who know the taste
        of this essence. The Glories of the Lord of the Universe cannot
        be known. O Nanak, He is totally amazing and wonderful!  || 11
        ||   PAUREE:  The eleventh day of the lunar cycle:  Behold the
        Lord, the Lord, near at hand. Subdue the desires of your sexual
        organs, and listen to the Lord's Name. Let your mind be content,
        and be kind to all beings. In this way, your fast will be successful.
        Keep your wandering mind restrained in one place. Your mind and
        body shall become pure, chanting the Lord's Name. The Supreme
        Lord God is pervading amongst all. O Nanak, sing the Kirtan of
        the Lord's Praises; this alone is the eternal faith of Dharma.
        || 11 ||   SHALOK:  Evil-mindedness is eliminated, by meeting
        with and serving the compassionate Holy Saints. Nanak is merged
        with God; all his entanglements have come to an end.  || 12 ||
        PAUREE:  The twelfth day of the lunar cycle:  Dedicate yourself
        to giving charity, chanting the Naam and purification. Worship
        the Lord with devotion, and get rid of your pride. Drink in the
        Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's Name, in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. The mind is satisfied by lovingly singing
        the Kirtan of God's Praises. The Sweet Words of His Bani
        soothe everyone. The soul, the subtle essence of the five elements,
        cherishes the Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. This faith
        is obtained from the Perfect Guru. O Nanak, dwelling upon the
        Lord, you shall not enter the womb of reincarnation again.  ||
        12 ||   SHALOK:  Engrossed in the three qualities, one's
        efforts do not succeed. When the Saving Grace of sinners dwells
        in the mind, O Nanak, then one is saved by the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 13 ||   PAUREE:  The thirteenth day of the lunar
        cycle:  The world is in the fever of the three qualities. It comes
        and goes, and is reincarnated in hell. Meditation on the Lord,
        Har, Har, does not enter into the minds of the people. They do
        not sing the Praises of God, the Ocean of peace, even for an instant.
        This body is the embodiment of pleasure and pain. It suffers from
        the chronic and incurable disease of Maya. By day, people practice
        corruption, wearing themselves out. And then with sleep in their
        eyes, they mutter in dreams. Forgetting the Lord, this is their
        condition. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the kind and compassionate
        Primal Being.  || 13 ||   SHALOK:  The Lord is pervading in all
        the four directions and the fourteen worlds. O Nanak, He is not
        seen to be lacking anything; His works are perfectly complete.
        || 14 ||   PAUREE:  The fourteenth day of the lunar cycle:  God
        Himself is in all four directions. On all worlds, His radiant
        glory is perfect. The One God is diffused in the ten directions.
        Behold God in all the earth and sky. In the water, on the land,
        in the forests and mountains, and in the nether regions of the
        underworld, the Merciful Transcendent Lord is abiding. The Lord
        God is in all mind and matter, subtle and manifest. O Nanak, the
        Gurmukh realizes God.  || 14 ||   SHALOK:  The soul is conquered,
        through the Guru's Teachings, singing the Glories of God.
        By the Grace of the Saints, fear is dispelled, O Nanak, and anxiety
        is ended.  || 15 ||   PAUREE:  The day of the new moon:  My soul
        is at peace; the Divine Guru has blessed me with contentment. </p>

      <p> My mind and body are cooled and soothed, in intuitive peace and
        poise; I have dedicated myself to serving God. One who meditates
        in remembrance on the Name of the Lord  -  his bonds are broken,
        all his sins are erased, and his works are brought to perfect
        fruition; his evil-mindedness disappears, and his ego is subdued.
        Taking to the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God, his comings and
        goings in reincarnation are ended. He saves himself, along with
        his family, chanting the Praises of God, the Lord of the Universe.
        I serve the Lord, and I chant the Name of God. From the Perfect
        Guru, Nanak has obtained peace and comfortable ease.  || 15 ||
        SHALOK:  The perfect person never wavers; God Himself made him
        perfect. Day by day, he prospers; O Nanak, he shall not fail.
        || 16 ||   PAUREE:  The day of the full moon:  God alone is Perfect;
        He is the All-powerful Cause of causes. The Lord is kind and compassionate
        to all beings and creatures; His Protecting Hand is over all.
        He is the Treasure of Excellence, the Lord of the Universe; through
        the Guru, He acts. God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts,
        is All-knowing, Unseen and Immaculately Pure. The Supreme Lord
        God, the Transcendent Lord, is the Knower of all ways and means.
        He is the Support of His Saints, with the Power to give Sanctuary.
        Twenty-four hours a day, I bow in reverence to Him. His Unspoken
        Speech cannot be understood; I meditate on the Feet of the Lord.
        He is the Saving Grace of sinners, the Master of the masterless;
        Nanak has entered God's Sanctuary.  || 16 ||   SHALOK:  My
        pain is gone, and my sorrows have departed, since I took to the
        Sanctuary of the Lord, my King. I have obtained the fruits of
        my mind's desires, O Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 17 ||   PAUREE:  Some sing, some listen, and
        some contemplate; some preach, and some implant the Name within;
        this is how they are saved. Their sinful mistakes are erased,
        and they become pure; the filth of countless incarnations is washed
        away. In this world and the next, their faces shall be radiant;
        they shall not be touched by Maya. They are intuitively wise,
        and they are Vaishnaavs, worshippers of Vishnu; they are spiritually
        wise, wealthy and prosperous. They are spiritual heros, of noble
        birth, who vibrate upon the Lord God. The Kh'shatriyas, the
        Brahmins, the low-caste Soodras, the Vaisha workers and the outcast
        pariahs are all saved, meditating on the Lord. Nanak is the dust
        of the feet of those who know his God.  || 17 || </p>

        VAAR IN GAUREE,  FOURTH MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The True Guru, the Primal Being, is kind and compassionate; all
        are alike to Him. He looks upon all impartially; with pure faith
        in the mind, He is obtained. The Ambrosial Nectar is within the
        True Guru; He is exalted and sublime, of Godly status. O Nanak,
        by His Grace, one meditates on the Lord; the Gurmukhs obtain Him.
        || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Egotism and Maya are total poison; in
        these, people continually suffer loss in this world. The Gurmukh
        earns the profit of the wealth of the Lord's Name, contemplating
        the Word of the Shabad. The poisonous filth of egotism is removed,
        when one enshrines the Ambrosial Name of the Lord within the heart. </p>

      </p>
      <p> All the Gurmukh's affairs are brought to perfect completion;
        the Lord has showered him with His Mercy. O Nanak, one who meets
        the Primal Lord remains blended with the Lord, the Creator Lord.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You are True, O True Lord and Master. You
        are the Truest of the True, O Lord of the World. Everyone meditates
        on You; everyone falls at Your Feet. Your Praises are graceful
        and beautiful; You save those who speak them. You reward the Gurmukhs,
        who are absorbed in the True Name. O my Great Lord and Master,
        great is Your glorious greatness.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:
        Without the Name, all other praise and speech is insipid and
        tasteless. The self-willed manmukhs praise their own egos; their
        attachment to egotism is useless. Those whom they praise, die;
        they all waste away in conflict. O servant Nanak, the Gurmukhs
        are saved, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the Embodiment
        of Supreme Bliss.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  O True Guru, tell me
        of my Lord God, that I may meditate on the Naam within my mind.
        O Nanak, the Lord's Name is sacred and pure; chanting it,
        all my pain has been taken away.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You Yourself
        are the Formless Lord, the Immaculate Lord, our Sovereign King.
        Those who meditate on You, O True Lord with one-pointed mind,
        are rid of all their pain. You have no equal, next to whom I might
        sit and speak of You. You are the only Giver as great as Yourself.
        You are Immaculate; O True Lord, you are pleasing to my mind.
        O my True Lord and Master, Your Name is the Truest of the True.
        || 2 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  Deep within the mind is the
        disease of ego; the self-willed manmukhs, the evil beings, are
        deluded by doubt. O Nanak, this disease is eradicated, only when
        one meets the True Guru, our Holy Friend.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:
        The mind and body of the Gurmukh are imbued with the Love of
        the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue. Servant Nanak has taken to the
        Sanctuary of the Lord. Hail to the Guru, who has united me with
        the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You are the Personification of Creativity,
        the Inaccessible Lord. With whom should I compare You? If there
        was anyone else as great as You, I would name him; You alone are
        like Yourself. You are the One, permeating each and every heart;
        You are revealed to the Gurmukh. You are the True Lord and Master
        of all; You are the Highest of all. Whatever You do, O True Lord
        -  that is what happens, so why should we grieve?  || 3 ||
        SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  My mind and body are imbued with the
        Love of my Beloved, twenty-four hours a day. Shower Your Mercy
        upon servant Nanak, O God, that he may dwell in peace with the
        True Guru.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Those whose inner beings are
        filled with the Love of their Beloved, look beautiful as they
        speak. O Nanak, the Lord Himself knows all; the Beloved Lord has
        infused His Love.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O Creator Lord, You Yourself
        are infallible; You never make mistakes. Whatever You do is good,
        O True Lord; this understanding is obtained through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad. You are the Cause of causes, the All-powerful
        Lord; there is no other at all. O Lord and Master, You are inaccessible
        and merciful. </p>

      <p> Everyone meditates on You. All beings are Yours; You belong to
        all. You deliver all.  || 4 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  Listen,
        O my Friend, to my message of love; my eyes are fixed upon You.
        The Guru was pleased  -  He united servant Nanak with his friend,
        and now he sleeps in peace.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The True
        Guru is the Merciful Giver; He is always compassionate. The True
        Guru has no hatred within Him; He beholds the One God everywhere.
        Anyone who directs hate against the One who has no hate, shall
        never be satisfied within. The True Guru wishes everyone well;
        how can anything bad happen to Him? As one feels towards the True
        Guru, so are the rewards he receives. O Nanak, the Creator knows
        everything; nothing can be hidden from Him.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        One who has been made great by his Lord and Master  -  know
        him to be great! By His Pleasure, the Lord and Master forgives
        those who are pleasing to His Mind. One who tries to compete with
        Him is a senseless fool. One who is united with the Lord by the
        True Guru, sings His Praises and speaks His Glories. O Nanak,
        the True Lord is True; one who understands Him is absorbed in
        Truth.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord is true, immaculate
        and eternal; He has no fear, hatred or form. Those who chant and
        meditate on Him, who single-mindedly focus their consciousness
        on Him, are rid of the burden of their ego. Those Gurmukhs who
        worship and adore the Lord  -  hail to those Saintly beings!
        If someone slanders the Perfect True Guru, he will be rebuked
        and reproached by the whole world. The Lord Himself abides within
        the True Guru; He Himself is His Protector. Blessed, Blessed is
        the Guru, who sings the Glories of God. Unto Him, I bow forever
        and ever in deepest reverence. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to
        those who have meditated on the Creator Lord.  || 1 ||   FOURTH
        MEHL:  He Himself made the earth; He Himself made the sky. He
        Himself created the beings there, and He Himself places food in
        their mouths. He Himself is All-pervading; He Himself is the Treasure
        of Excellence. O servant Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord; He shall take away all your sinful mistakes.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  You, O True Lord and Master, are True; the Truth
        is pleasing to the True One. The Messenger of Death does not even
        approach those who praise You, O True Lord. Their faces are radiant
        in the Court of the Lord; the Lord is pleasing to their hearts.
        The false ones are left behind; because of the falsehood and deceit
        in their hearts, they suffer in terrible pain. Black are the faces
        of the false; the false remain just false.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,
        FOURTH MEHL:  The True Guru is the field of Dharma; as one plants
        the seeds there, so are the fruits obtained. The GurSikhs plant
        ambrosial nectar, and obtain the Lord as their ambrosial fruit.
        Their faces are radiant in this world and the next; in the Court
        of the Lord, they are robed with honor. </p>

      <p> Some have cruelty in their hearts  -  they constantly act in
        cruelty; as they plant, so are the fruits which they eat. When
        the True Guru, the Tester, observes with His Glance, the selfish
        ones are all exposed. As one thinks, so does he receive, and so
        does the Lord make him known. O Nanak, the Lord and Master is
        pervading at both ends; He continually acts, and beholds His own
        play.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The mortal is of one mind  - 
        whatever he dedicates it to, in that he is successful. Some talk
        a lot, but they eat only that which is in their own homes. Without
        the True Guru, understanding is not obtained, and egotism does
        not depart from within. Suffering and hunger cling to the egotistical
        people; they hold out their hands and beg from door to door. Their
        falsehood and fraud cannot remain concealed; their false appearances
        fall off in the end. One who has such pre-ordained destiny comes
        to meet God through the True Guru. Just as iron is transmuted
        into gold by the touch of the Philosopher's Stone, so are
        people transformed by joining the Sangat, the Holy Congregation.
        O God, You are the Master of servant Nanak; as it pleases You,
        You lead him.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  One who serves the Lord with
        all his heart  -  the Lord Himself unites him with Himself.
        He enters into a partnership with virtue and merit, and burns
        off all his demerits with the fire of the Shabad. Demerits are
        purchased cheap, like straw; he alone gathers merit, who is so
        blessed by the True Lord. I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has
        erased my demerits, and revealed my virtuous merits. The Gurmukh
        chants the glorious greatness of the great Lord God.  || 7 ||
        SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  Great is the greatness within the True
        Guru, who meditates night and day on the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har. The repetition of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is his
        purity and self-restraint; with the Name of the Lord, He is satisfied.
        The Lord's Name is His power, and the Lord's Name is
        His Royal Court; the Lord's Name protects Him. One who centers
        his consciousness and worships the Guru, obtains the fruits of
        his mind's desires. But one who slanders the Perfect True
        Guru, shall be killed and destroyed by the Creator. This opportunity
        shall not come into his hands again; he must eat what he himself
        has planted. He shall be taken to the most horrible hell, with
        his face blackened like a thief, and a noose around his neck.
        But if he should again take to the Sanctuary of the True Guru,
        and meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, then he shall
        be saved. Nanak speaks and proclaims the Lord's Story; as
        it pleases the Creator, so does he speak.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:
        One who does not obey the Hukam, the Command of the Perfect Guru
        -  that self-willed manmukh is plundered by his ignorance
        and poisoned by Maya. Within him is falsehood, and he sees everyone
        else as false; the Lord has tied these useless conflicts around
        his neck. He babbles on and on, but the words he speaks please
        no one. He wanders from house to house like an abandoned woman;
        whoever associates with him is stained by the mark of evil as
        well. Those who become Gurmukh avoid him; they forsake his company
        and sit hear the Guru. </p>

      <p> O chosen people, O self-elect, one who does not publicly affirm
        his Guru is not a good person; he loses all his profits and capital.
        People used to chant and recite the Shaastras and the Vedas, O
        Nanak, but now the Words of the Perfect Guru have come to be the
        most exalted of all. The glorious greatness of the Perfect Guru
        is pleasing to the GurSikh; the self-willed manmukhs have lost
        this opportunity.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The True Lord is truly the
        greatest of all; he alone obtains Him, who is anointed by the
        Guru. He is the True Guru, who meditates on the True Lord. The
        True Lord and the True Guru are truly One. He is the True Guru,
        the Primal Being, who has totally conquered his five passions.
        One who does not serve the True Guru, and who praises himself,
        is filled with falsehood within. Cursed, cursed is his ugly face.
        His words are not pleasing to anyone; his face is blackened, and
        he is separated from the True Guru.  || 8 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  Everyone is the field of the Lord God; the Lord Himself
        cultivates this field. The Gurmukh grows the crop of forgiveness,
        while the self-willed manmukh loses even his roots. They all plant
        for their own good, but the Lord causes to grow only that field
        with which He is pleased. The GurSikh plants the seed of the Lord's
        Ambrosial Nectar, and obtains the Lord's Ambrosial Naam as
        his Ambrosial Fruit. The mouse of Death is continually gnawing
        away at the crop, but the Creator Lord has beaten it off and driven
        it away. The farm was successful, by the Love of the Lord, and
        the crop was produced by God's Grace. He has removed all
        the burning and anxiety of those, who have meditated on the True
        Guru, the Primal Being. O servant Nanak, one who worships and
        adores the Naam, the Name of the Lord, swims across, and saves
        the whole world as well.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The self-willed
        manmukh is occupied with greed all day long, although he may claim
        otherwise. At night, he is overcome by fatigue, and all his nine
        holes are weakened. Over the head of the manmukh is the order
        of the woman; to her, he ever holds out his promises of goodness.
        Those men who act according to the orders of women are impure,
        filthy and foolish. Those impure men are engrossed in sexual desire;
        they consult their women and walk accordingly. One who walks as
        the True Guru tells him to, is the true man, the best of the best.
        He Himself created all women and men; the Lord Himself plays every
        play. You created the entire creation; O Nanak, it is the best
        of the best.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You are carefree, unfathomable
        and immeasurable; how can You be measured? Those who have met
        the True Guru and who meditate on You are very fortunate. The
        Word of the True Guru's Bani is the embodiment of Truth;
        through Gurbani, one becomes perfect. Jealously emulating the
        True Guru, some others may speak of good and bad, but the false
        are destroyed by their falsehood. Deep within them is one thing,
        and in their mouths is another; they suck in the poison of Maya,
        and then they painfully waste away.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  Service to the True Guru is immaculate and pure; those
        humble beings who are pure perform this service. Those who have
        deceit, corruption and falsehood within  -  the True Lord Himself
        casts them out like lepers. <br>
