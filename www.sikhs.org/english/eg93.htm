      <p> But then, I slept in peace and comfort, when I met the Guru, and
        found my Friend.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  When I forget You, I endure
        all pains and afflictions. Making thousands of efforts, they are
        still not eliminated. One who forgets the Name, is known as a
        poor person. One who forgets the Name, wanders in reincarnation.
        One who does not remember his Lord and Master, is punished by
        the Messenger of Death. One who does not remember his Lord and
        Master, is judged to be a sick person. One who does not remember
        his Lord and Master, is egotistical and proud. One who forgets
        the Name is miserable in this world.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  I have not seen any other like You. You alone are pleasing
        to Nanak's mind. I am a dedicated, devoted sacrifice to
        that friend, that mediator, who leads me to recognize my Husband
        Lord.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Beautiful are those feet which walk
        towards You; beautiful is that head which falls at Your Feet.
        Beautiful is that mouth which sings Your Praises; beautiful is
        that soul which seeks Your Sanctuary.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Meeting
        the Lord's brides, in the True Congregation, I sing the
        songs of joy. The home of my heart is now held steady, and I shall
        not go out wandering again. Evil-mindedness has been dispelled,
        along with sin and my bad reputation. I am well-known as being
        calm and good-natured; my heart is filled with Truth. Inwardly
        and outwardly, the One and only Lord is my way. My mind is thirsty
        for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. I am a slave at His feet.
        I am glorified and embellished, when my Lord and Master enjoys
        me. I meet Him through my blessed destiny, when it is pleasing
        to His Will.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  All virtues are
        Yours, Dear Lord; You bestow them upon us. I am unworthy -
        what can I achieve, O Nanak? There is no other Giver as great
        as You. I am a beggar; I beg from You forever.  || 1 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  My body was wasting away, and I was depressed. The Guru,
        my Friend, has encouraged and consoled me. I sleep in total peace
        and comfort; I have conquered the whole world.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        The Darbaar of Your Court is glorious and great. Your holy throne
        is True. You are the Emperor over the heads of kings. Your canopy
        and chauree (fly-brush) are permanent and unchanging. That alone
        is true justice, which is pleasing to the Will of the Supreme
        Lord God. Even the homeless receive a home, when it is pleasing
        to the Will of the Supreme Lord God. Whatever the Creator Lord
        does, is a good thing. Those who recognize their Lord and Master,
        are seated in the Court of the Lord. True is Your Command; no
        one can challenge it. O Merciful Lord, Cause of causes, Your creative
        power is all-powerful.  || 16 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Hearing
        of You, my body and mind have blossomed forth; chanting the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, I am flushed with life. Walking on the Path,
        I have found cool tranquility deep within; gazing upon the Blessed
        Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I am enraptured.  || 1 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  I have found the jewel within my heart. I was not
        charged for it; the True Guru gave it to me. My search has ended,
        and I have become stable. O Nanak, I have conquered this priceless
        human life.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  One who has such good karma inscribed
        upon his forehead, is committed to the Lord's service.
        One whose heart lotus blossoms forth upon meeting the Guru, remains
        awake and aware, night and day. <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> All doubt and fear run away from one who is in love with the Lord's
        lotus feet. He conquers his soul, following the Guru's
        Teachings, and attains the Imperishable Lord. He alone keeps up
        in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, who meditates on the Supreme Lord
        God. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he is immaculate,
        as if he has bathed at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
        He alone is a man of good fortune, who has met with God. Nanak
        is a sacrifice to such a one, whose destiny is so great!  || 17
        ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  When the Husband Lord is within the
        heart, then Maya, the bride, goes outside. When one's Husband
        Lord is outside of oneself, then Maya, the bride, is supreme.
        Without the Name, one wanders all around. The True Guru shows
        us that the Lord is with us. Servant Nanak merges in the Truest
        of the True.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Making all sorts of efforts,
        they wander around; but they do not make even one effort. O Nanak,
        how rare are those who understand the effort which saves the world.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The greatest of the great, infinite is Your
        dignity. Your colors and hues are so numerous; no one can know
        Your actions. You are the Soul within all souls; You alone know
        everything. Everything is under Your control; Your home is beautiful.
        Your home is filled with bliss, which resonates and resounds throughout
        Your home. Your honor, majesty and glory are Yours alone. You
        are overflowing with all powers; wherever we look, there You are.
        Nanak, the slave of Your slaves, prays to You alone.  || 18 ||
        SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Your streets are covered with canopies;
        under them, the traders look beautiful. O Nanak, he alone is truly
        a banker, who buys the infinite commodity.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        Kabeer, no one is mine, and I belong to no one. I am absorbed
        in the One, who created this creation.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The
        Lord is the most beautiful fruit tree, bearing fruits of Ambrosial
        Nectar. My mind longs to meet Him; how can I ever find Him? He
        has no color or form; He is inaccessible and unconquerable. I
        love Him with all my soul; He opens the door for me. I shall serve
        you forever, if you tell me of my Friend. I am a sacrifice, a
        dedicated, devoted sacrifice to Him. The Beloved Saints tell us,
        to listen with our consciousness. One who has such pre-ordained
        destiny, O slave Nanak, is blessed with the Ambrosial Name by
        the True Guru.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Kabeer, the earth
        belongs to the Holy, but the thieves have come and now sit among
        them. The earth does not feel their weight; even they profit.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Kabeer, for the sake of the rice, the
        husks are beaten and threshed. When one sits in the company of
        evil people, then he will be called to account by the Righteous
        Judge of Dharma.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself has the greatest
        family; He Himself is all alone. He alone knows His own worth.
        He Himself, by Himself, created everything. Only He Himself can
        describe His own creation. Blessed is Your place, where You dwell,
        Lord. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Blessed are Your devotees, who see You, O True Lord. He alone
        praises You, who is blessed by Your Grace. One who meets the Guru,
        O Nanak, is immaculate and sanctified.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Fareed, this world is beautiful, but there is a thorny
        garden within it. Those who are blessed by their spiritual teacher
        are not even scratched.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Fareed, blessed
        is the life, with such a beautiful body. How rare are those who
        are found to love their Beloved Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He alone
        obtains meditation, austerities, self-discipline, compassion and
        Dharmic faith, whom the Lord so blesses. He alone meditates on
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, whose fire the Lord puts out.
        The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Inaccessible Primal
        Lord, inspires us to look upon all with an impartial eye. With
        the support of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one
        falls in love with God. One's faults are eradicated, and
        one's face becomes radiant and bright; through the Lord's
        Name, one crosses over. The fear of birth and death is removed,
        and he is not reincarnated again. God lifts him up and pulls him
        out of the deep, dark pit, and attaches him to the hem of His
        robe. O Nanak, God forgives him, and holds him close in His embrace.
        || 21 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who loves God is imbued
        with the deep crimson color of His love. O Nanak, such a person
        is rarely found; the value of such a humble person can never be
        estimated.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The True Name has pierced the
        nucleus of my self deep within. Outside, I see the True Lord as
        well. O Nanak, He is pervading and permeating all places, the
        forests and the meadows, the three worlds, and every hair.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself created the Universe; He Himself imbues
        it. He Himself is One, and He Himself has numerous forms. He Himself
        is within all, and He Himself is beyond them. He Himself is known
        to be far away, and He Himself is right here. He Himself is hidden,
        and He Himself is revealed. No one can estimate the value of Your
        Creation, Lord. You are deep and profound, unfathomable, infinite
        and invaluable. O Nanak, the One Lord is all-pervading. You are
        the One and only.  || 22 || 1 || 2 ||  SUDH  || <br>

        - how can his words be judged? His divine virtues are the
        true sisters and brothers; through them, the gift of supreme status
        is obtained. Nanak established the kingdom; He built the true
        fortress on the strongest foundations. He installed the royal
        canopy over Lehna's head; chanting the Lord's Praises,
        He drank in the Ambrosial Nectar. The Guru implanted the almighty
        sword of the Teachings to illuminate his soul. The Guru bowed
        down to His disciple, while Nanak was still alive. The King, while
        still alive, applied the ceremonial mark to his forehead.  ||
        1 ||   Nanak proclaimed Lehna's succession - he
        earned it. They shared the One Light and the same way; the King
        just changed His body. The immaculate canopy waves over Him, and
        He sits on the throne in the Guru's shop. <br>

      <p> He does as the Guru commands; He tasted the tasteless stone of
        Yoga. The Langar - the Kitchen of the Guru's Shabad
        has been opened, and its supplies never run short. Whatever His
        Master gave, He spent; He distributed it all to be eaten. The
        Praises of the Master were sung, and the Divine Light descended
        from the heavens to the earth. Gazing upon You, O True King, the
        filth of countless past lives is washed away. The Guru gave the
        True Command; why should we hesitate to proclaim this? His sons
        did not obey His Word; they turned their backs on Him as Guru.
        These evil-hearted ones became rebellious; they carry loads of
        sin on their backs. Whatever the Guru said, Lehna did, and so
        he was installed on the throne. Who has lost, and who has won?
        || 2 ||   He who did the work, is accepted as Guru; so which
        is better - the thistle or the rice? The Righteous Judge
        of Dharma considered the arguments and made the decision. Whatever
        the True Guru says, the True Lord does; it comes to pass instantaneously.
        Guru Angad was proclaimed, and the True Creator confirmed it.
        Nanak merely changed his body; He still sits on the throne, with
        hundreds of branches reaching out. Standing at His door, His followers
        serve Him; by this service, their rust is scraped off. He is the
        Dervish - the Saint, at the door of His Lord and Master;
        He loves the True Name, and the Bani of the Guru's Word.
        Balwand says that Khivi, the Guru's wife, is a noble woman,
        who gives soothing, leafy shade to all. She distributes the bounty
        of the Guru's Langar; the kheer - the rice pudding
        and ghee, is like sweet ambrosia. The faces of the Guru's
        Sikhs are radiant and bright; the self-willed manmukhs are pale,
        like straw. The Master gave His approval, when Angad exerted Himself
        heroically. Such is the Husband of mother Khivi; He sustains the
        world.  || 3 ||   It is as if the Guru made the Ganges flow in
        the opposite direction, and the world wonders: what has he done?
        Nanak, the Lord, the Lord of the World, spoke the words out loud.
        Making the mountain his churning stick, and the snake-king his
        churning string, He has churned the Word of the Shabad. From it,
        He extracted the fourteen jewels, and illuminated the world. He
        revealed such creative power, and touched such greatness. He raised
        the royal canopy to wave over the head of Lehna, and raised His
        glory to the skies. His Light merged into the Light, and He blended
        Him into Himself. Guru Nanak tested His Sikhs and His sons, and
        everyone saw what happened. When Lehna alone was found to be pure,
        then He was set on the throne.  || 4 ||   Then, the True Guru,
        the son of Pheru, came to dwell at Khadoor. Meditation, austerities
        and self-discipline rest with You, while the others are filled
        with excessive pride. Greed ruins mankind, like the green algae
        in the water. In the Guru's Court, the Divine Light shines
        in its creative power. You are the cooling peace, whose depth
        cannot be found. You are overflowing with the nine treasures,
        and the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Whoever slanders
        You will be totally ruined and destroyed. People of the world
        can see only what is near at hand, but You can see far beyond. <br>

      <p> Then the True Guru, the son of Pheru, came to dwell at Khadoor.
        || 5 ||   The same mark on the forehead, the same throne, and
        the same Royal Court. Just like the father and grandfather, the
        son is approved. He took the thousand-headed serpent as his churning
        string, and with the force of devotional love, he churned the
        ocean of the world with his churning stick, the Sumayr mountain.
        He extracted the fourteen jewels, and brought forth the Divine
        Light. He made intuition his horse, and chastity his saddle. He
        placed the arrow of the Lord's Praise in the bow of Truth.
        In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, there was only pitch darkness.
        Then, He rose like the sun to illuminate the darkness. He farms
        the field of Truth, and spreads out the canopy of Truth. Your
        kitchen always has ghee and flour to eat. You understand the four
        corners of the universe; in your mind, the Word of the Shabad
        is approved and supreme. You eliminate the comings and goings
        of reincarnation, and bestow the insignia of Your Glance of Grace.
        You are the Avataar, the Incarnation of the all-knowing Primal
        Lord. You are not pushed or shaken by the storm and the wind;
        you are like the Sumayr Mountain. You know the inner state of
        the soul; You are the Knower of knowers. How can I praise You,
        O True Supreme King, when You are so wise and all-knowing? Those
        blessings granted by the Pleasure of the True Guru - please
        bless Satta with those gifts. Seeing Nanak's canopy waving
        over Your head, everyone was astonished. The same mark on the
        forehead, the same throne, and the same Royal Court. Just like
        the father and grandfather, the son is approved.  || 6 ||   Blessed,
        blessed is Guru Raam Daas; He who created You, has also exalted
        You. Perfect is Your miracle; the Creator Lord Himself has installed
        You on the throne. The Sikhs and all the Congregation recognize
        You as the Supreme Lord God, and bow down to You. You are unchanging,
        unfathomable and immeasurable; You have no end or limitation.
        Those who serve You with love - You carry them across.
        Greed, envy, sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment -
        You have beaten them and driven them out. Blessed is Your place,
        and True is Your magnificent glory. You are Nanak, You are Angad,
        and You are Amar Daas; so do I recognize You. When I saw the Guru,
        then my mind was comforted and consoled.  || 7 ||   The four Gurus
        enlightened the four ages; the Lord Himself assumed the fifth
        form. He created Himself, and He Himself is the supporting pillar.
        He Himself is the paper, He Himself is the pen, and He Himself
        is the writer. All His followers come and go; He alone is fresh
        and new. Guru Arjun sits on the throne; the royal canopy waves
        over the True Guru. From east to west, He illuminates the four
        directions. Those self-willed manmukhs who do not serve the Guru
        die in shame. Your miracles increase two-fold, even four-fold;
        this is the True Lord's true blessing. The four Gurus enlightened
        the four ages; the Lord Himself assumed the fifth form.  || 8

      <p> Let the Word of the Guru's Shabad be the molasses. Cut
        up desire, sexuality, anger, pride and envy, and let them be the
        fermenting bark.  || 1 ||   Is there any Saint, with intuitive
        peace and poise deep within, unto whom I might offer my meditation
        and austerities as payment? I dedicate my body and mind to whoever
        gives me even a drop of this wine from such a vat.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I have made the fourteen worlds the furnace, and I have
        burnt my body with the fire of God. My mudra - my hand-gesture,
        is the pipe; tuning into the celestial sound current within, the
        Shushmanaa - the central spinal channel, is my cooling
        pad.  || 2 ||   Pilgrimages, fasting, vows, purifications, self-discipline,
        austerities and breath control through the sun and moon channels
        - all these I pledge. My focused consciousness is the cup,
        and the Ambrosial Nectar is the pure juice. I drink in the supreme,
        sublime essence of this juice.  || 3 ||   The pure stream constantly
        trickles forth, and my mind is intoxicated by this sublime essence.
        Says Kabeer, all other wines are trivial and tasteless; this is
        the only true, sublime essence.  || 4 || 1 ||   Make spiritual
        wisdom the molasses, meditation the flowers, and the Fear of God
        the fire enshrined in your mind. The Shushmanaa, the central spinal
        channel, is intuitively balanced, and the drinker drinks in this
        wine.  || 1 ||   O hermit Yogi, my mind is intoxicated. When that
        wine rises up, one tastes the sublime essence of this juice, and
        sees across the three worlds.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Joining the
        two channels of the breath, I have lit the furnace, and I drink
        in the supreme, sublime essence. I have burnt both sexual desire
        and anger, and I have been emancipated from the world.  || 2 ||
        The light of spiritual wisdom enlightens me; meeting with the
        Guru, the True Guru, I have obtained this understanding. Slave
        Kabeer is intoxicated with that wine, which never wears off. 
        || 3 || 2 ||   You are my Sumayr Mountain, O my Lord and Master;
        I have grasped Your Support. You do not shake, and I do not fall.
        You have preserved my honor.  || 1 ||   Now and then, here and
        there, You, only You. By Your Grace, I am forever in peace.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Relying upon You, I can live even in the cursed
        place of Magahar; You have put out the fire of my body. First,
        I obtained the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan in Magahar; then,
        I came to dwell at Benares.  || 2 ||   As is Magahar, so is Benares;
        I see them as one and the same. I am poor, but I have obtained
        this wealth of the Lord; the proud are bursting with pride, and
        die.  || 3 ||   One who takes pride in himself is stuck with thorns;
        no one can pull them out. Here, he cries bitterly, and hereafter,
        he burns in the most hideous hell.  || 4 ||   What is hell, and
        what is heaven? The Saints reject them both. I have no obligation
        to either of them, by the Grace of my Guru.  || 5 ||   Now, I
        have mounted to the throne of the Lord; I have met the Lord, the
        Sustainer of the World. The Lord and Kabeer have become one. No
        one can tell them apart.  || 6 || 3 ||   I honor and obey the
        Saints, and punish the wicked; this is my duty as God's
        police officer. Day and night, I wash Your feet, Lord; I wave
        my hair as the chauree, to brush away the flies.  || 1 ||   I
        am a dog at Your Court, Lord. <br>

      <p> I open my snout and bark before it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In my
        past life, I was Your servant; now, I cannot leave You. The celestial
        sound current resounds at Your Door. Your insignia is stamped
        upon my forehead.  || 2 ||   Those who are branded with Your brand
        fight bravely in battle; those without Your brand run away. One
        who becomes a Holy person, appreciates the value of devotional
        worship to the Lord. The Lord places him in His treasury.  ||
        3 ||   In the fortress is the chamber; by contemplative meditation
        it becomes the supreme chamber. The Guru has blessed Kabeer with
        the commodity, saying, &quot;Take this commodity; cherish it
        and keep it secure.&quot;  || 4 ||   Kabeer gives it to the world,
        but he alone receives it, upon whose forehead such destiny is
        recorded. Permanent is the marriage, of one who receives this
        ambrosial essence.  || 5 || 4 ||   O Brahmin, how can you forget
        the One, from whose mouth the Vedas and the Gayitri prayer issured
        forth? The whole world falls at His feet; why don't you
        chant the Name of that Lord, O Pandit?  || 1 ||   Why, O my Brahmin,
        do you not chant the Lord's Name? If you don't chant
        the Lord's Name, O Pandit, you will only suffer in hell.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You think that you are high, but you take
        food from the houses of the lowly; you fill up your belly by forcibly
        practicing your rituals. On the fourteenth day, and the night
        of the new moon, you go out begging; even though you hold the
        lamp in your hands, still, you fall into the pit.  || 2 ||   You
        are a Brahmin, and I am only a weaver from Benares. How can I
        compare to you? Chanting the Lord's Name, I have been saved;
        relying on the Vedas, O Brahmin, you shall drown and die.  ||
        3 || 5 ||   There is a single tree, with countless branches and
        twigs; its flowers and leaves are filled with its juice. This
        world is a garden of Ambrosial Nectar. The Perfect Lord created
        it.  || 1 ||   I have come to know the story of my Sovereign Lord.
        How rare is that Gurmukh who knows, and whose inner being is illumined
        by the Lord's Light.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The bumble bee,
        addicted to the nectar of the twelve-petalled flowers, enshrines
        it in the heart. He holds his breath suspended in the sixteen-petalled
        sky of the Akaashic Ethers, and beats his wings in esctasy.  ||
        2 ||   In the profound void of intuitive Samaadhi, the one tree
        rises up; it soaks up the water of desire from the ground. Says
        Kabeer, I am the servant of those who have seen this celestial
        tree.  || 3 || 6 ||   Make silence your ear-rings, and compassion
        your wallet; let meditation be your begging bowl. Sew this body
        as your patched coat, and take the Lord's Name as your
        support.  || 1 ||   Practice such Yoga, O Yogi. As Gurmukh, enjoy
        meditation, austerities and self-discipline.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Apply the ashes of wisdom to your body; let your horn be
        your focused consciousness. Become detached, and wander through
        the city of your body; play the harp of your mind.  || 2 ||  
        Enshrine the five tatvas - the five elements, within your
        heart; let your deep meditative trance be undisturbed. Says Kabeer,
        listen, O Saints: make righteousness and compassion your garden.
        || 3 || 7 ||   For what purpose were you created and brought
        into the world? What rewards have you received in this life? God
        is the boat to carry you across the terrifying world-ocean; He
        is the Fulfiller of the mind's desires. <br>

      <p> You have not centered your mind on Him, even for an instant. 
        || 1 ||   O Lord of the Universe, I am such a sinner! God gave
        me body and soul, but I have not practiced loving devotional worship
        to Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Others' wealth, others'
        bodies, others' wives, others' slander and others'
        fights - I have not given them up. For the sake of these,
        coming and going in reincarnation happens over and over again,
        and this story never ends.  || 2 ||   That house, in which the
        Saints speak of the Lord - I have not visited it, even
        for an instant. Drunkards, thieves, and evil-doers - I
        constantly dwell with them.  || 3 ||   Sexual desire, anger, the
        wine of Maya, and envy - these are what I collect within
        myself. Compassion, righteousness, and service to the Guru -
        these do not visit me, even in my dreams.  || 4 ||   He is merciful
        to the meek, compassionate and benevolent, the Lover of His devotees,
        the Destroyer of fear. Says Kabeer, please protect Your humble
        servant from disaster; O Lord, I serve only You.  || 5 || 8 ||
        Remembering Him in meditation, the door of liberation is found.
        You shall go to heaven, and not return to this earth. In the home
        of the Fearless Lord, the celestial trumpets resound. The unstruck
        sound current will vibrate and resonate forever.  || 1 ||   Practice
        such meditative remembrance in your mind. Without this meditative
        remembrance, liberation will never be found.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Remembering Him in meditation, you will meet with no obstruction.
        You will be liberated, and the great load will be taken away.
        Bow in humility within your heart, and you will not have to be
        reincarnated over and over again.  || 2 ||   Remember Him in meditation,
        celebrate and be happy. God has placed His lamp deep within you,
        which burns without any oil. That lamp makes the world immortal;
        it conquers and drives out the poisons of sexual desire and anger.
        || 3 ||   Remembering Him in meditation, you shall obtain salvation.
        Wear that meditative remembrance as your necklace. Practice that
        meditative remembrance, and never let it go. By Guru's
        Grace, you shall cross over.  || 4 ||   Remembering Him in meditation,
        you shall not be obligated to others. You shall sleep in your
        mansion, in blankets of silk. Your soul shall blossom forth in
        happiness, on this comfortable bed. So drink in this meditative
        remembrance, night and day.  || 5 ||   Remembering Him in meditation,
        your troubles will depart. Remembering Him in meditation, Maya
        will not bother you. Meditate, meditate in remembrance on the
        Lord, Har, Har, and sing His Praises in your mind. This meditative
        remembrance is obtained from the True Guru.  || 6 ||   Forever
        and ever, remember Him, day and night, while standing up and sitting
        down, with every breath and morsel of food. While awake and asleep,
        enjoy the essence of this meditative remembrance. The Lord's
        meditative remembrance is obtained by good destiny.  || 7 || 
        Remembering Him in meditation, you shall not be loaded down.
        Make this meditative remembrance of the Lord's Name your
        Support. Says Kabeer, He has no limits; no tantras or mantras
        can be used against Him.  || 8 || 9 || <br>

      <p> The Guru, the Liberated One, has put out the fire. When I came
        to understand this mind, from the tips of my toes to the crown
        of my head, then I took my cleansing bath, deep within my self.
        || 1 ||   The mind, the master of the breath, abides in the state
        of supreme bliss. There is no death, no re-birth, and no aging
        for me now.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Turning away from materialism,
        I have found intuitive support. I have entered into the sky of
        the mind, and opened the Tenth Gate. The chakras of the coiled
        Kundalini energy have been opened, and I have met my Sovereign
        Lord King without fear.  || 2 ||   My attachment to Maya has been
        eradicated; the moon energy has devoured the sun energy. When
        I was focused and merged into the all-pervading Lord, then the
        unstruck sound current began to vibrate.  || 3 ||   The Speaker
        has spoken, and proclaimed the Word of the Shabad. The hearer
        has heard, and enshrined it in the mind. Chanting to the Creator,
        one crosses over. Says Kabeer, this is the essence.  || 4 || 1
        || 10 ||   The moon and the sun are both the embodiment of light.
        Within their light, is God, the incomparable.  || 1 ||   O spiritual
        teacher, contemplate God. In this light is contained the expanse
        of the created universe.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Gazing upon the
        diamond, I humbly salute this diamond. Says Kabeer, the Immaculate
        Lord is indescribable.  || 2 || 2 || 11 ||   People of the world,
        remain awake and aware. Even though you are awake, you are being
        robbed, O Siblings of Destiny. While the Vedas stand guard watching,
        the Messenger of Death carries you away.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        He thinks that the bitter nimm fruit is a mango, and the mango
        is a bitter nimm. He imagines the ripe banana on the thorny bush.
        He thinks that the ripe coconut hangs on the barren simmal tree;
        what a stupid, idiotic fool he is!  || 1 ||   The Lord is like
        sugar, spilled onto the sand; the elephant cannot pick it up.
        Says Kabeer, give up your ancestry, social status and honor; be
        like the tiny ant - pick up and eat the sugar.  || 2 ||

      <p> In the imperishable realm of the Formless Lord, I play the flute
        of the unstruck sound current.  || 1 ||   Becoming detached, I
        sing the Lord's Praises. Imbued with the unattached, unstruck
        Word of the Shabad, I shall go to the home of the Lord, who has
        no ancestors.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Then, I shall no longer control
        the breath through the energy channels of the Ida, Pingala and
        Shushmanaa. I look upon both the moon and the sun as the same,
        and I shall merge in the Light of God.  || 2 ||   I do not go
        to see sacred shrines of pilgrimage, or bathe in their waters;
        I do not bother any beings or creatures. The Guru has shown me
        the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage within my own heart, where
        I now take my cleansing bath.  || 3 ||   I do not pay attention
        to anyone praising me, or calling me good and nice. Says Naam
        Dayv, my consciousness is imbued with the Lord; I am absorbed
        in the profound state of Samaadhi.  || 4 || 2 ||   When there
        was no mother and no father, no karma and no human body, when
        I was not and you were not, then who came from where?  || 1 ||
        O Lord, no one belongs to anyone else. We are like birds perched
        on a tree.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When there was no moon and no
        sun, then water and air were blended together. When there were
        no Shaastras and no Vedas, then where did karma come from?  ||
        2 ||   Control of the breath and positioning of the tongue, focusing
        at the third eye and wearing malas of tulsi beads, are all obtained
        through Guru's Grace. Naam Dayv prays, this is the supreme
        essence of reality; the True Guru has inspired this realization.
        || 3 || 3 ||   RAAMKALEE,  SECOND HOUSE:  Someone may practice
        austerities at Benares, or die upside-down at a sacred shrine
        ofpilgrimage, or burn his body in fire, or rejuvenate his body
        to life almost forever; he may perform the horse-sacrifice ceremony,
        or give donations of gold covered over, but none of these is equal
        to the worship of the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   O hypocrite,
        renounce and abandon your hypocrisy; do not practice deception.
        Constantly, continually, chant the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Someone may go to the Ganges or the Godaavari, or
        to the Kumbha festival, or bathe at Kaydaar Naat'h, or
        make donations of thousands of cows at Gomti; he may make millions
        of pilgrimages to sacred shrines, or freeze his body in the Himalayas;
        still, none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's
        Name.  || 2 ||   Someone may give away horses and elephants, or
        women on their beds, or land; he may give such gifts over and
        over again. He may purify his soul, and give away in charity his
        body weight in gold; none of these is equal to the worship of
        the Lord's Name.  || 3 ||   Do not harbor anger in your

      <p> || 1 ||   O Divine Lord, the knot of skepticism cannot be untied.
        Sexual desire, anger, Maya, intoxication and jealousy -
        these five have combined to plunder the world.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I am a great poet, of noble heritage; I am a Pandit, a religious
        scholar, a Yogi and a Sannyaasi; I am a spiritual teacher, a warrior
        and a giver - such thinking never ends.  || 2 ||   Says
        Ravi Daas, no one understands; they all run around, deluded like
        madmen. The Lord's Name is my only Support; He is my life,
        my breath of life, my wealth.  || 3 || 1 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The energy channels of the Ida, Pingala and
        Shushmanaa: these three dwell in one place. This is the true place
        of confluence of the three sacred rivers: this is where my mind
        takes its cleansing bath.  || 1 ||   O Saints, the Immaculate
        Lord dwells there; how rare are those who go to the Guru, and
        understand this. The all-pervading immaculate Lord is there. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   What is the insignia of the Divine Lord's
        dwelling? The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates there.
        There is no moon or sun, no air or water there. The Gurmukh becomes
        aware, and knows the Teachings.  || 2 ||   Spiritual wisdom wells
        up, and evil-mindedness departs; the nucleus of the mind sky is
        drenched with Ambrosial Nectar. One who knows the secret of this
        device, meets the Supreme Divine Guru.  || 3 ||   The Tenth Gate
        is the home of the inaccessible, infinite Supreme Lord. Above
        the store is a niche, and within this niche is the commodity.
        || 4 ||   One who remains awake, never sleeps. The three qualities
        and the three worlds vanish, in the state of Samaadhi. He takes
        the Beej Mantra, the Seed Mantra, and keeps it in his heart. Turning
        his mind away from the world, he focuses on the cosmic void of
        the absolute Lord.  || 5 ||   He remains awake, and he does not
        lie. He keeps the five sensory organs under his control. He cherishes
        in his consciousness the Guru's Teachings. He dedicates
        his mind and body to the Lord's Love.  || 6 ||   He considers
        his hands to be the leaves and branches of the tree. He does not
        lose his life in the gamble. He plugs up the source of the river
        of evil tendencies. Turning away from the west, he makes the sun
        rise in the east. He bears the unbearable, and the drops trickle
        down within; then, he speaks with the Lord of the world.  || 7
        ||   The four-sided lamp illuminates the Tenth Gate. The Primal
        Lord is at the center of the countless leaves. He Himself abides
        there with all His powers. He weaves the jewels into the pearl
        of the mind.  || 8 ||   The lotus is at the forehead, and the
        jewels surround it. Within it is the Immaculate Lord, the Master
        of the three worlds. The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds,
        resound and vibrate their in their purity. The chauris -
        the fly brushes wave, and the conch shells blare like thunder.
        The Gurmukh tramples the demons underfoot with his spiritual wisdom.
        Baynee longs for Your Name, Lord.  || 9 || 1 || </font><br>
