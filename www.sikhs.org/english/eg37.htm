      <p> Children, wives, homes, and all possessions  -  attachment
        to all of these is false.  || 1 ||   O mind, why do you burst
        out laughing? See with your eyes, that these things are only mirages.
        So earn the profit of meditation on the One Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   It is like the clothes which you wear on your body  - 
        they wear off in a few days. How long can you run upon a wall?
        Ultimately, you come to its end.  || 2 ||   It is like salt, preserved
        in its container; when it is put into water, it dissolves. When
        the Order of the Supreme Lord God comes, the soul arises, and
        departs in an instant.  || 3 ||   O mind, your steps are numbered,
        your moments spent sitting are numbered, and the breaths you are
        to take are numbered. Sing forever the Praises of the Lord, O
        Nanak, and you shall be saved, under the Shelter of the Feet of
        the True Guru.  || 4 || 1 || 123 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  That
        which was upside-down has been set upright; the deadly enemies
        and adversaries have become friends. In the darkness, the jewel
        shines forth, and the impure understanding has become pure.  ||
        1 ||   When the Lord of the Universe became merciful, I found
        peace, wealth and the fruit of the Lord's Name; I have met
        the True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   No one knew me, the miserable
        miser, but now, I have become famous all over the world. Before,
        no one would even sit with me, but now, all worship my feet. 
        || 2 ||   I used to wander in search of pennies, but now, all
        the desires of my mind are satisfied. I could not bear even one
        criticism, but now, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        I am cooled and soothed.  || 3 ||   What Glorious Virtues of the
        Inaccessible, Unfathomable, Profound Lord can one mere tongue
        describe? Please, make me the slave of the slave of Your slaves;
        servant Nanak seeks the Lord's Sanctuary.  || 4 || 2 || 124
        ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  O fool, you are so slow to earn your
        profits, and so quick to run up losses. You do not purchase the
        inexpensive merchandise; O sinner, you are tied to your debts.
        || 1 ||   O True Guru, You are my only hope. Your Name is the
        Purifier of sinners, O Supreme Lord God; You are my only Shelter.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Listening to the evil talk, you are caught
        up in it, but you are hesitant to chant the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord. You are delighted by slanderous talk; your understanding
        is corrupt.  || 2 ||   Others' wealth, others' wives
        and the slander of others  -  eating the uneatable, you have
        gone crazy. You have not enshrined love for the True Faith of
        Dharma; hearing the Truth, you are enraged.  || 3 ||   O God,
        Merciful to the meek, Compassionate Lord Master, Your Name is
        the Support of Your devotees. Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary;
        O God, make him Your Own, and preserve his honor.  || 4 || 3 ||
        125 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  They are attached to falsehood;
        clinging to the transitory, they are trapped in emotional attachment
        to Maya. Wherever they go, they do not think of the Lord; they
        are blinded by intellectual egotism.  || 1 ||   O mind, O renunciate,
        why don't you adore Him? You dwell in that flimsy chamber,
        with all the sins of corruption.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> Crying out, &quot;Mine, mine&quot;, your days and nights pass
        away; moment by moment, your life is running out. The sweet flavors
        tempt you, and you are occupied by your false and filthy business.
        || 2 ||   Your senses are beguiled by sensual pleasures of sex,
        by anger, greed and emotional attachment. The All-powerful Architect
        of Destiny has ordained that you shall be reincarnated over and
        over again.  || 3 ||   When the Destroyer of the pains of the
        poor becomes merciful, then, as Gurmukh, you shall find absolute
        peace. Says Nanak, meditate on the Lord, day and night, and all
        your sickness shall be banished.  || 4 ||   Meditate in this way,
        O Siblings of Destiny, on the Lord, the Architect of Destiny.
        The Destroyer of the pains of the poor has become merciful; He
        has removed the pains of birth and death.  || 1 ||  Second Pause
        || 4 || 4 || 126 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  For a moment of sexual
        pleasure, you shall suffer in pain for millions of days. For an
        instant, you may savor pleasure, but afterwards, you shall regret
        it, again and again.  || 1 ||   O blind man, meditate on the Lord,
        the Lord, your King. Your day is drawing near.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   You are deceived, beholding with your eyes, the bitter melon
        and swallow-wort. But, like the companionship of a poisonous snake,
        so is the desire for another's spouse.  || 2 ||   For the
        sake of your enemy, you commit sins, while you neglect the reality
        of your faith. Your friendship is with those who abandon you,
        and you are angry with your friends.  || 3 ||   The entire world
        is entangled in this way; he alone is saved, who has the Perfect
        Guru. Says Nanak, I have crossed over the terrifying world-ocean;
        my body has become sanctified.  || 4 || 5 || 127 ||   AASAA, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  O Lord, You behold whatever we do in secrecy; the
        fool may stubbornly deny it. By his own actions, he is tied down,
        and in the end, he regrets and repents.  || 1 ||   My God knows,
        ahead of time, all things. Deceived by doubt, you may hide your
        actions, but in the end, you shall have to confess the secrets
        of your mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever they are attached
        to, they remain joined to that. What can any mere mortal do? Please,
        forgive me, O Supreme Lord Master. Nanak is forever a sacrifice
        to You.  || 2 || 6 || 128 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  He Himself
        preserves His servants; He causes them to chant His Name. Wherever
        the business and affairs of His servants are, there the Lord hurries
        to be.  || 1 ||   The Lord appears near at hand to His servant.
        Whatever the servant asks of his Lord and Master, immediately
        comes to pass.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am a sacrifice to that
        servant, who is pleasing to his God. Hearing of his glory, the
        mind is rejuvenated; Nanak comes to touch his feet.  || 2 || 7

      </center>
      <p> The actor displays himself in many disguises, but he remains just
        as he is. The soul wanders through countless incarnations in doubt,
        but it does not come to dwell in peace. </p>

      <p> || 1 ||   O Saints, my friends and companions, without the Lord,
        Har, Har, you shall perish. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and win this
        precious treasure of human life.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God has
        created Maya of the three qualities; tell me, how can it be crossed
        over? The whirlpool is awesome and unfathomable; only through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad is one carried across.  ||
        2 ||   Searching and searching endlessly, seeking and deliberating,
        Nanak has realized the true essence of reality. Meditating on
        the invaluable treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the
        jewel of the mind is satisfied.  || 3 || 1 || 130 ||   AASAA,
        FIFTH MEHL,  DU-PADAS:  By Guru's Grace, He dwells within
        my mind; whatever I ask for, I receive. This mind is satisfied
        with the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; it does not go
        out, anywhere, anymore.  || 1 ||   My Lord and Master is the highest
        of all; night and day, I sing the Glories of His Praises. In an
        instant, He establishes and disestablishes; through Him, I frighten
        you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When I behold my God, my Lord and Master,
        I do not pay any attention to any other. God Himself has adorned
        servant Nanak; his doubts and fears have been dispelled, and he
        writes the account of the Lord.  || 2 || 2 || 131 ||   AASAA,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The four castes and social classes, and the preachers
        with the six Shaastras on their finger-tips, the beautiful, the
        refined, the shapely and the wise  -  the five passions have
        enticed and beguiled them all.  || 1 ||   Who has seized and conquered
        the five powerful fighters? Is there anyone strong enough? He
        alone, who conquers and defeats the five demons, is perfect in
        this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They are so
        awesome and great; they cannot be controlled, and they do not
        run away. Their army is mighty and unyielding. Says Nanak, that
        humble being who is under the protection of the Saadh Sangat,
        crushes those terrible demons.  || 2 || 3 || 132 ||   AASAA, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Sublime Sermon of the Lord is the best thing
        for the soul. All other tastes are insipid.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The worthy beings, heavenly singers, silent sages and the knowers
        of the six Shaastras proclaim that nothing else is worthy of consideration.
        || 1 ||   It is the cure for evil passions, unique, unequalled
        and peace-giving; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        O Nanak, drink it in.  || 2 || 4 || 133 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:
        My Beloved has brought forth a river of nectar. The Guru has
        not held it back from my mind, even for an instant.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Beholding it, and touching it, I am sweetened and
        delighted. It is imbued with the Creator's Love.  || 1 ||
        Chanting it even for a moment, I rise to the Guru; meditating
        on it, one is not trapped by the Messenger of Death. The Lord
        has placed it as a garland around Nanak's neck, and within
        his heart.  || 2 || 5 || 134 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is exalted and sublime. ||  Pause
        ||   Every day, hour and moment, I continually sing and speak
        of Govind, Govind, the Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||   Walking,
        sitting and sleeping, I chant the Lord's Praises; I treasure
        His Feet in my mind and body.  || 2 ||   I am so small, and You
        are so great, O Lord and Master; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary.

      </center>
      <p> Renounce all your cleverness and remember the Supreme, Formless
        Lord God. Without the One True Name, everything appears as dust.
        || 1 ||   Know that God is always with you. By Guru's Grace,
        one understands, and is imbued with the Love of the One Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Seek the Shelter of the One All-powerful
        Lord; there is no other place of rest. The vast and terrifying
        world-ocean is crossed over, singing continually the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord.  || 2 ||   Birth and death are overcome,
        and one does not have to suffer in the City of Death. He alone
        obtains the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, unto whom
        God shows His Mercy.  || 3 ||   The One Lord is my Anchor and
        Support; the One Lord alone is the power of my mind. O Nanak,
        joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on
        Him; without the Lord, there is no other at all.  || 4 || 1 ||
        136 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The soul, the mind, the body and
        the breath of life belong to God. He has given all tastes and
        pleasures. He is the Friend of the poor, the Giver of life, the
        Protector of those who seek His Sanctuary.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Here and hereafter,
        He is our Helper and Companion; embrace love and affection for
        the One Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They meditate on the Vedas
        and the Shaastras, to swim across the world-ocean. The many religious
        rituals, good deeds of karma and Dharmic worship  -  above
        all of these is the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   Sexual
        desire, anger, and egotism depart, meeting with the Divine True
        Guru. Implant the Naam within, perform devotional worship to the
        Lord and serve God  -  this is good.  || 3 ||   I seek the
        Sanctuary of Your Feet, O Merciful Lord; You are the Honor of
        the dishonored. You are the Support of my soul, my breath of life;
        O God, You are Nanak's strength.  || 4 || 2 || 137 ||   AASAA,
        FIFTH MEHL:  He wavers and falters, and suffers such great pain,
        without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. The profit
        of the sublime essence of the Lord of the Universe is obtained,
        by the Love of the One Supreme Lord God.  || 1 ||   Chant continually
        the Name of the Lord. With each and every breath, meditate on
        God, and renounce other love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God is the
        Doer, the All-powerful Cause of causes; He Himself is the Giver
        of life. So renounce all your cleverness, and meditate on God,
        twenty-four hours a day.  || 2 ||   He is our best friend and
        companion, ou_r help and support; He is lofty, inaccessible and
        infinite. Enshrine His Lotus Feet within your heart; He is the
        Support of the soul.  || 3 ||   Show Your Mercy, O Supreme Lord
        God, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises. Total peace, and the
        greatest greatness, O Nanak, are obtained by living to chant the
        Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 3 || 138 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        I make the effort, as You cause me to do, my Lord and Master,
        to behold You in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. I
        am imbued with the color of the Love of the Lord, Har, Har; God
        Himself has colored me in His Love.  || 1 ||   I chant the Lord's
        Name within my mind. Bestow Your Mercy, and dwell within my heart;
        please, become my Helper.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Listening continually
        to Your Name, O Beloved God, I yearn to behold You. </p>

        and purpose.  || 2 ||   My body and wealth are Yours; You are
        my God  -  nothing is in my power. As You keep me, so do I
        live; I eat what You give me.  || 3 ||   The sinful residues of
        countless incarnations are washed away, by bathing in the dust
        of the Lord's humble servants. By loving devotional worship,
        doubt and fear depart; O Nanak, the Lord is Ever-present.  ||
        4 || 4 || 139 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Blessed Vision of
        Your Darshan is unapproachable and incomprehensible; he alone
        obtains it, who has such good destiny recorded upon his forehead.
        The Merciful Lord God has bestowed His Mercy, and the True Guru
        has granted the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   The Divine Guru is
        the Saving Grace in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. Even those fools
        and idiots, stained with feces and urine, have all taken to Your
        service.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You Yourself are the Creator, who
        established the entire world. You are contained in all. The Righteous
        Judge of Dharma is wonder-struck, at the sight of everyone falling
        at the Lord's Feet.  || 2 ||   The Golden Age of Sat Yuga,
        the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga, and the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga
        are good; but the best is the Dark Age, the Iron Age, of Kali
        Yuga. As we act, so are the rewards we receive; no one can take
        the place of another.  || 3 ||   O Dear Lord, whatever Your devotees
        ask for, You do. This is Your Way, Your very nature. With my palms
        pressed together, O Nanak, I beg for this gift; Lord, please bless
        Your Saints with Your Vision.  || 4 || 5 || 140 || </p>

        indecent people, have been purified in Your company.  || 1 ||
        Those who have wandered in reincarnation, and those who have
        been consigned to hell  -  even their families have been redeemed.

        Congregation.  || 4 || 2 || 142 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  TI-PADAS:

        the Love of the Beloved.  || 3 || 3 || 143 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH

        being, You, O Fascinating Lord, You exist.  || 1 ||   You are
        the Creator, the Cause of causes, the Support of the earth; You
        are the One and only, Beauteous Lord.  || 2 ||   Meeting the Saints,
        and beholding the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, Nanak is a
        sacrifice to them; he sleeps in absolute peace.  || 3 || 4 ||

        is priceless. It brings peace and poise.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        The Lord is my Companion and Helper; He shall not forsake me
        or leave me. He is unfathomable and unequalled.  || 1 ||   He
        is my Beloved, my brother, father and mother; He is the Support
        of His devotees.  || 2 ||   The Invisible Lord is seen through
        the Guru; O Nanak, this is the wondrous play of the Lord.  ||
        3 || 5 || 145 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Please help me sustain
        my devotion. O Lord Master, I have come to You.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   With the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, life
        becomes fruitful. Lord, please place Your Feet within my heart.
        || 1 ||   This is liberation, and this is the best way of life;
        please, keep me in the Society of the Saints.  || 2 ||   Meditating
        on the Naam, I am absorbed in celestial peace; O Nanak, I sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 3 || 6 || 146 ||   AASAA,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Feet of my Lord and Master are so Beautiful!
        The Lord's Saints obtain them.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They
        eradicate their self-conceit and serve the Lord; drenched in His
        Love, they sing His Glorious Praises.  || 1 ||   They place their
        hopes in Him, and they thirst for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
        Nothing else is pleasing to them.  || 2 ||   This is Your Mercy,
        Lord; what can Your poor creatures do? Nanak is devoted, a sacrifice
        to You.  || 3 || 7 || 147 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Remember the
        One Lord in meditation within your mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        Meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and enshrine Him
        within your heart. Without Him there is no other.  || 1 ||   Entering
        God's Sanctuary, all rewards are obtained, and all pains
        are taken away.  || 2 ||   He is the Giver of all beings, the
        Architect of Destiny; O Nanak, He is contained in each and every
        heart.  || 3 || 8 || 148 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who forgets
        the Lord is dead.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who meditates on the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, obtains all rewards. That person becomes
        happy.  || 1 ||   One who calls himself a king, and acts in ego
        and pride, is caught by his doubts, like a parrot in a trap. 
        || 2 ||   Says Nanak, one who meets the True Guru, becomes permanent
        and immortal.  || 3 || 9 || 149 || </p>

      <p> He sleeps, intoxicated by corruption and Maya; he does not come
        to realize or understand. Seizing him by the hair, the Messenger
        of Death pulls him up; then, he comes to his senses.  || 1 ||
        Those who are attached to the poison of greed and sin grab at
        the wealth of others; they only bring pain on themselves. They
        are intoxicated by their pride in those things which shall be

        Lord, Har, Har, in your mind. The Guru says to install it in your
        consciousness. Turn away from others, and turn to Him. Thus you
        shall obtain your Beloved, O my companion.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        In the pool of the world is the mud of attachment. Stuck in
        it, the his feet cannot walk towards the Lord. The fool is stuck;
        he cannot do anything else. Only by entering the Lord's Sanctuary,
        O my companion, will you be released.  || 1 ||   Thus your consciousness
        shall be stable and steady and firm. Wilderness and household
        are the same. Deep within dwells the One Husband Lord; outwardly,

        his forehead, obtains it; he crosses over the terrifying ocean
        of fire. He obtains a place in the home of his own self, and enjoys
        the most sublime essence of the Lord's essence. His hunger
        is appeased; Nanak, he is absorbed in celestial peace, O my mind.
        || 2 || 2 || 158 ||   AASAAVAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Sing the Praises
        of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. Meditate on the celestial music. The
        tongues of the holy Saints repeat it. I have heard that this is
        the way to emancipation. This is found by the greatest merit,
        O my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The silent sages search for Him.
        God is the Master of all. It is so difficult to find Him in this

        of the Siddhas. They remain awake and aware night and day; Nanak,
        they are blessed by great good fortune, O my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause

        shall be cleansed.  Becoming the dust of the feet of the Lord's

        of His devotees, he is no longer subject to birth and death. They
        alone become eternal, who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        O my mind.  || 1 ||   You are my Friend, my Best Friend. Please,
        implant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me. Without Him,
        there is not any other. Within my mind, I worship Him in adoration.
        I do not forget Him, even for an instant. How can I live without
        Him? I am a sacrifice to the Guru. Nanak, chant the Name, O my
        mind.  || 2 || 5 || 161 ||   AASAAVAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are
        the Creator, the Cause of causes. I cannot think of any other.

        I rid myself of my self-conceit, my sufferings have ended. He
        has showered His Mercy upon me. The Creator Lord has preserved
        my honor, O my mind.  || 1 ||   Know that this is the only peace;
        accept whatever the Lord does. No one is bad. Become the dust
        of the Feet of the Saints. He Himself preserves those who taste
        the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord, O my mind.  || 2 ||   One who
        has no one to call his own  -  God belongs to him. God knows
        the state of our innermost being. He knows everything. Please,
        Lord, save the sinners. This is Nanak's prayer, O my mind.

        in the Lord. He churns the true pleasures to obtain the supreme
        nectar.  || 1 ||   Listen to such spiritual wisdom, O my mind.
        The Lord is totally pervading and permeating all places.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   One who makes Truthfulness his fast and religious
        vows, does not suffer the pain of death. Through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, he burns away his anger. He dwells in the
        Tenth Gate, immersed in the Samaadhi of deep meditation. Touching
        the philosopher's stone, he obtains the supreme status. 
        || 2 ||   For the benefit of the mind, churn the true essence
        of reality; bathing in the over-flowing tank of nectar, filth
        is washed away. We become like the One with whom we are imbued.
        Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass.  || 3 ||   The Guru
        is cool and soothing like ice; He puts out the fire of the mind.
        Smear your body with the ashes of dedicated service, and live
        in the home of peace  -  make this your religious order. Let
        the Immaculate Bani of the Word be your playing of the flute.
        || 4 ||   Spiritual wisdom within is the supreme, sublime nectar.
        Contemplation of the Guru is one's bathing at holy places
        of pilgrimage. Worship and adoration within is the Lord's
        dwelling. He is the One who blends one's light with the Divine
        Light.  || 5 ||   He delights in the delightful wisdom of loving
        the One Lord. He is one of the self-elect  -  he merges with

        to the Will of his Lord and Master. The Unknowable Lord cannot
        be understood.  || 6 ||   The lotus originates in the water, and

      <p> Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass. Listen, O Bharthari Yogi
        -   Nanak speaks after deliberation; the Immaculate Name is
        my only Support.  || 8 || 1 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  All meditation,
        all austerities, and all clever tricks, lead one to wander in
        the wilderness, but he does not find the Path. Without understanding,
        he is not approved; without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, ashes
        are thrown upon one's head.  || 1 ||   True is the Master;
        the world comes and goes. The mortal is emancipated, as Gurmukh,
        as the Lord's slave.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The world is bound
        by its attachments to the many desires. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, some become free of desire. Within them is the Naam,
        and their heart lotus blossoms forth. They have no fear of death.
        || 2 ||   The men of the world are conquered by woman; they love
        the ladies. Attached to children and wife, they forget the Naam.
        They waste this human life in vain, and lose the game in the gamble.
        Serving the True Guru is the best occupation.  || 3 ||   One who
        speaks egotistically in public, never attains liberation within.
        One who burns away his attachment to Maya, by the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, meditates forever within his heart on the
        Immaculate Naam.  || 4 ||   He restrains his wandering mind, and
        keeps it under control. The company of such a Sikh is obtained
        only by Grace. Without the Guru, he goes astray and continues
        coming and going. Bestowing His Mercy, the Lord unites him in
        Union.  || 5 ||   I cannot describe the Beauteous Lord. I speak
        the unspoken; I cannot estimate His value. All pain and pleasure
        come by Your Will. All pain is eradicated by the True Name.  ||
        6 ||   He plays the instrument without hands, and dances without
        feet. But if he understands the Word of the Shabad, then he shall
        behold the True Lord. With the True Lord within the self, all
        happiness comes. Showering His Mercy, the Preserving Lord preserves
        him.  || 7 ||   He understands the three worlds; he eliminates
        his self-conceit. He understands the Bani of the Word, and he
        is absorbed into the True Lord. Contemplating the Shabad, he enshrines
        love for the One Lord. O Nanak, blessed is the Lord, the Embellisher.
        || 8 || 2 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  There are innumerable writings;
        those who write them take pride in them. When one's mind
        accepts the Truth, he understands, and speaks of it. Words, spoken
        and read again and again, are useless loads. There are innumerable
        writings, but the Infinite Lord remains unwritten.  || 1 ||  
        Know that such a True Lord is the One and only. Understand that
        birth and death come according to the Lord's Will.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Because of attachment to Maya, the world is bound
        by the Messenger of Death. These bonds are released when one remembers
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Guru is the Giver of peace;
        do not look for any other. In this world, and the next, He shall
        stand by you.  || 2 ||   One who dies in the Word of the Shabad,
        embraces love for the One Lord. One who eats the uneatable, has
        his doubts dispelled. He is Jivan Mukta  -  liberated while
        yet alive; the Naam abides in his mind. Becoming Gurmukh, he merges
        into the True Lord.  || 3 ||   The One who created the earth and
        the Akaashic ethers of the sky, established all; He establishes
        and disestablishes. He Himself is permeating all. He does not
        consult anyone; He Himself forgives.  || 4 ||   You are the Ocean,
        over-flowing with jewels and rubies. You are immaculate and pure,
        the true treasure of virtue. <br>
