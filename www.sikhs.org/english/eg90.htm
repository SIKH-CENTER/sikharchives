      <p> He is the Architect of Destiny; He blesses us with mind and body.
        That Architect of Destiny is in my mind and mouth. God is the
        Life of the world; there is no other at all. O Nanak, imbued with
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is honored.  || 9 ||   One
        who lovingly chants the Name of the Sovereign Lord King, fights
        the battle and conquers his own mind; day and night, he remains
        imbued with the Lord's Love. He is famous throughout the
        three worlds and the four ages. One who knows the Lord, becomes
        like Him. He becomes absolutely immaculate, and his body is sanctified.
        His heart is happy, in love with the One Lord. He lovingly centers
        his attention deep within upon the True Word of the Shabad.  ||
        10 ||   Don't be angry - drink in the Ambrosial
        Nectar; you shall not remain in this world forever. The ruling
        kings and the paupers shall not remain; they come and go, throughout
        the four ages. Everyone says that they will remain, but none of
        them remain; unto whom should I offer my prayer? The One Shabad,
        the Name of the Lord, will never fail you; the Guru grants honor
        and understanding.  || 11 ||   My shyness and hesitation have
        died and gone, and I walk with my face unveiled. The confusion
        and doubt from my crazy, insane mother-in-law has been removed
        from over my head. My Beloved has summoned me with joyful caresses;
        my mind is filled with the bliss of the Shabad. Imbued with the
        Love of my Beloved, I have become Gurmukh, and carefree.  || 12
        ||   Chant the jewel of the Naam, and earn the profit of the Lord.
        Greed, avarice, evil and egotism; slander, inuendo and gossip;
        the self-willed manmukh is blind, foolish and ignorant. For the
        sake of earning the profit of the Lord, the mortal comes into
        the world. But he becomes a mere slave laborer, and is mugged
        by the mugger, Maya. One who earns the profit of the Naam, with
        the capital of faith, O Nanak, is truly honored by the True Supreme
        King.  || 13 ||   The world is ruined on the path of Death. No
        one has the power to erase Maya's influence. If wealth
        visits the home of the lowliest clown, seeing that wealth, all
        pay their respects to him. Even an idiot is thought of as clever,
        if he is rich. Without devotional worship, the world is insane.
        The One Lord is contained among all. He reveals Himself, unto
        those whom He blesses with His Grace.  || 14 ||   Throughout the
        ages, the Lord is eternally established; He has no vengeance.
        He is not subject to birth and death; He is not entangled in worldly
        affairs. Whatever is seen, is the Lord Himself. Creating Himself,
        He establishes Himself in the heart. He Himself is unfathomable;
        He links people to their affairs. He is the Way of Yoga, the Life
        of the World. Living a righteous lifestyle, true peace is found.
        Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, how can anyone find liberation?
        || 15 ||   Without the Name, even one's own body is an
        enemy. Why not meet the Lord, and take away the pain of your mind?
        The traveller comes and goes along the highway. What did he bring
        when he came, and what will he take away when he goes? Without
        the Name, one loses everywhere. The profit is earned, when the
        Lord grants understanding. In merchandise and trade, the merchant
        is trading. Without the Name, how can one find honor and nobility?
        || 16 ||   One who contemplates the Lord's Virtues is
        spiritually wise. Through His Virtues, one receives spiritual
        wisdom. How rare in this world, is the Giver of virtue. The True
        way of life comes through contemplation of the Guru. The Lord
        is inaccessible and unfathomable. <br>

      </p>
      <p> His worth cannot be estimated. They alone meet Him, whom the Lord
        causes to meet. The virtuous soul bride continually contemplates
        His Virtues. O Nanak, following the Guru's Teachings, one
        meets the Lord, the true friend.  || 17 ||   Unfulfilled sexual
        desire and unresolved anger waste the body away, as gold is dissolved
        by borax. The gold is touched to the touchstone, and tested by
        fire; when its pure color shows through, it is pleasing to the
        eye of the assayer. The world is a beast, and arrogent Death is
        the butcher. The created beings of the Creator receive the karma
        of their actions. What else can be said? There is nothing at all
        to say.  || 18 ||   Searching, searching, I drink in the Ambrosial
        Nectar. I have adopted the way of tolerance, and given my mind
        to the True Guru. Everyone calls himself true and genuine. He
        alone is true, who obtains the jewel throughout the four ages.
        Eating and drinking, one dies, but still does not know. He dies
        in an instant, when he realizes the Word of the Shabad. His consciousness
        becomes permanently stable, and his mind accepts death. By Guru's
        Grace, he realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 19 || 
        The Profound Lord dwells in the sky of the mind, the Tenth Gate;
        singing His Glorious Praises, one dwells in intuitive poise and
        peace. He does not go to come, or come to go. By Guru's
        Grace, he remains lovingly focused on the Lord. The Lord of the
        mind-sky is inaccessible, independent and beyond birth. The most
        worthy Samaadhi is to keep the consciousness stable, focused on
        Him. Remembering the Lord's Name, one is not subject to
        reincarnation. The Guru's Teachings are the most Excellent;
        all other ways lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 20 ||
        Wandering to countless doorsteps and homes, I have grown weary.
        My incarnations are countless, without limit. I have had so many
        mothers and fathers, sons and daughters. I have had so many gurus
        and disciples. Through a false guru, liberation is not found.
        There are so many brides of the One Husband Lord - consider
        this. The Gurmukh dies, and lives with God. Searching in the ten
        directions, I found Him within my own home. I have met Him; the
        True Guru has led me to meet Him.  || 21 ||   The Gurmukh sings,
        and the Gurmukh speaks. The Gurmukh evaluates the value of the
        Lord, and inspires others to evaluate Him as well. The Gurmukh
        comes and goes without fear. His filth is taken away, and his
        stains are burnt off. The Gurmukh contemplates the sound current
        of the Naad for his Vedas. The Gurmukh's cleansing bath
        is the performance of good deeds. For the Gurmukh, the Shabad
        is the most excellent Ambrosial Nectar. O Nanak, the Gurmukh crosses
        over.  || 22 ||   The fickle consciousness does not remain stable.
        The deer secretly nibbles at the green sprouts. One who enshrines
        the Lord's lotus feet in his heart and consciousness lives
        long, always remembering the Lord. Everyone has worries and cares.
        He alone finds peace, who thinks of the One Lord. When the Lord
        dwells in the consciousness, and one is absorbed in the Lord's
        Name, one is liberated, and returns home with honor.  || 23 ||
        The body falls apart, when one knot is untied. Behold, the world
        is on the decline; it wlll be totally destroyed. Only one who
        looks alike upon sunshine and shade has his bonds shattered; he
        is liberated and returns home. Maya is empty and petty; she has
        defrauded the world. Such destiny is pre-ordained by past actions.
        Youth is wasting away; old age and death hover above the head. <br>

      <p> The body falls apart, like algae upon the water.  || 24 ||   God
        Himself appears throughout the three worlds. Throughout the ages,
        He is the Great Giver; there is no other at all. As it pleases
        You, You protect and preserve us. I ask for the Lord's
        Praises, which bless me with honor and credit. Remaining awake
        and aware, I am pleasing to You, O Lord. When You unite me with
        Yourself, then I am merged in You. I chant Your Victorious Praises,
        O Life of the World. Accepting the Guru's Teachings, one
        is sure to merge in the One Lord.  || 25 ||   Why do you speak
        such nonsense, and argue with the world? You shall die repenting,
        when you see your own insanity. He is born, only to die, but he
        does not wish to live. He comes hopeful, and then goes, without
        hope. Regretting, repenting and grieving, he is dust mixing with
        dust. Death does not chew up one who sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord. The nine treasures are obtained through the Name
        of the Lord; the Lord bestows intuitive peace and poise.  || 26
        ||   He speaks spiritual wisdom, and He Himself understands it.
        He Himself knows it, and He Himself comprehends it. One who takes
        the Words of the Guru into his very fiber, is immaculate and holy,
        and is pleasing to the True Lord. In the ocean of the Guru, there
        is no shortage of pearls. The treasure of jewels is truly inexhaustible.
        Do those deeds which the Guru has ordained. Why are you chasing
        after the Guru's actions? O Nanak, through the Guru's
        Teachings, merge in the True Lord.  || 27 ||   Love is broken,
        when one speaks in defiance. The arm is broken, when it is pulled
        from both sides. Love breaks, when the speech goes sour. The Husband
        Lord abandons and leaves behind the evil-minded bride. The broken
        knot is tied again, through contemplation and meditation. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one's affairs are
        resolved in one's own home. One who earns the profit of
        the True Name, will not lose it again; the Lord and Master of
        the three worlds is your best friend.  || 28 ||   Control your
        mind, and keep it in its place. The world is destroyed by conflict,
        regretting its sinful mistakes. There is one Husband Lord, and
        all are His brides. The false bride wears many costumes. He stops
        her from going into the homes of others; He summons her to the
        Mansion of His Presence, and no obstacles block her path. She
        is embellished with the Word of the Shabad, and is loved by the
        True Lord. She is the happy soul bride, who takes the Support
        of her Lord and Master.  || 29 ||   Wandering and roaming around,
        O my companion, your beautiful robes are torn. In jealousy, the
        body is not at peace; without the Fear of God, multitudes are
        ruined. One who remains dead within her own home, through the
        Fear of God, is looked upon with favor by her all-knowing Husband
        Lord. She maintains fear of her Guru, and chants the Name of the
        Fearless Lord. Living on the mountain, I suffer such great thirst;
        when I see Him, I know that He is not far away. My thirst is quenched,
        and I have accepted the Word of the Shabad. I drink my fill of
        the Ambrosial Nectar. Everyone says, &quot;Give! Give!&quot;
        As He pleases, He gives. Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's
        Door, He gives, and quenches the thirst.  || 30 ||   Searching
        and seeking, I fell down and collapsed upon the bank of the river
        of life. Those who are heavy with sin sink down, but those who
        are light swim across. I am a sacrifice to those who meet the
        immortal and immeasurable Lord. The dust of their feet brings
        emancipation; in their company, we are united in the Lord's
        Union. I gave my mind to my Guru, and received the Immaculate
        Name. <br>

      <p> I serve the One who gave me the Naam; I am a sacrifice to Him.
        He who builds, also demolishes; there is no other than Him. By
        Guru's Grace, I contemplate Him, and then my body does
        not suffer in pain.  || 31 ||   No one is mine - whose
        gown should I grasp and hold? No one ever was, and no one shall
        ever be mine. Coming and going, one is ruined, afflicted with
        the disease of dual-mindedness. Those beings who lack the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, collapse like pillars of salt. Without the
        Name, how can they find release? They fall into hell in the end.
        Using a limited number of words, we describe the unlimited True
        Lord. The ignorant lack understanding. Without the Guru, there
        is no spiritual wisdom. The separated soul is like the broken
        string of a guitar, which does not vibrate its sound. God unites
        the separated souls with Himself, awakening their destiny.  ||
        32 ||   The body is the tree, and the mind is the bird; the birds
        in the tree are the five senses. They peck at the essence of reality,
        and merge with the One Lord. They are never trapped at all. But
        the others fly away in a hurry, when they see the food. Their
        feathers are clipped, and they are caught in the noose; through
        their mistakes, they are caught in disaster. Without the True
        Lord, how can anyone find release? The jewel of the Lord's
        Glorious Praises comes by the karma of good actions. When He Himself
        releases them, only then are they released. He Himself is the
        Great Master. By Guru's Grace, they are released, when
        He Himself grants His Grace. Glorious greatness rests in His Hands.
        He blesses those with whom He is pleased.  || 33 ||   The soul
        trembles and shakes, when it loses its mooring and support. Only
        the support of the True Lord brings honor and glory. Through it,
        one's works are never in vain. The Lord is eternal and
        forever stable; the Guru is stable, and contemplation upon the
        True Lord is stable. O Lord and Master of angels, men and Yogic
        masters, You are the support of the unsupported. In all places
        and interspaces, You are the Giver, the Great Giver. Wherever
        I look, there I see You, Lord; You have no end or limitation.
        You are pervading and permeating the places and interspaces; reflecting
        upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You are found. You
        give gifts even when they are not asked for; You are great, inaccessible
        and infinite.  || 34 ||   O Merciful Lord, You are the embodiment
        of mercy; creating the Creation, You behold it. Please shower
        Your Mercy upon me, O God, and unite me with Yourself. In an instant,
        You destroy and rebuild. You are all-wise and all-seeing; You
        are the Greatest Giver of all givers. He is the Eradicator of
        poverty, and the Destroyer of pain; the Gurmukh realizes spiritual
        wisdom and meditation.  || 35 ||   Losing his wealth, he cries
        out in anguish; the fool's consciousness is engrossed in
        wealth. How rare are those who gather the wealth of Truth, and
        love the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. If by losing your
        wealth, you may become absorbed in the Love of the One Lord, then
        just let it go. Dedicate your mind, and surrender your head; seek
        only the Support of the Creator Lord. Worldly affairs and wanderings
        cease, when the mind is filled with the bliss of the Shabad. Even
        one's enemies become friends, meeting with the Guru, the
        Lord of the Universe. Wandering from forest to forest searching,
        you will find that those things are within the home of your own
        heart. United by the True Guru, you shall remain united, and the
        pains of birth and death will be ended.  || 36 ||   Through various
        rituals, one does not find release. Without virtue, one is sent
        to the City of Death. <br>

      <p> One will not have this world or the next; committing sinful mistakes,
        one comes to regret and repent in the end. He has neither spiritual
        wisdom or meditation; neither Dharmic faith mor meditation. Without
        the Name, how can one be fearless? How can he understand egotistical
        pride? I am so tired - how can I get there? This ocean
        has no bottom or end. I have no loving companions, whom I can
        ask for help. O Nanak, crying out, &quot;Beloved, Beloved&quot;,
        we are united with the Uniter. He who separated me, unites me
        again; my love for the Guru is infinite.  || 37 ||   Sin is bad,
        but it is dear to the sinner. He loads himself with sin, and expands
        his world through sin. Sin is far away from one who understands
        himself. He is not afflicted by sorrow or separation. How can
        one avoid falling into hell? How can he cheat the Messenger of
        Death? How can coming and going be forgotten? Falsehood is bad,
        and death is cruel. The mind is enveloped by entanglements, and
        into entanglements it falls. Without the Name, how can anyone
        be saved? They rot away in sin.  || 38 ||   Again and again, the
        crow falls into the trap. Then he regrets it, but what can he
        do now? Even though he is trapped, he pecks at the food; he does
        not understand. If he meets the True Guru, then he sees with his
        eyes. Like a fish, he is caught in the noose of death. Do not
        seek liberation from anyone else, except the Guru, the Great Giver.
        Over and over again, he comes; over and over again, he goes. Be
        absorbed in love for the One Lord, and remain lovingly focused
        on Him. In this way you shall be saved, and you shall not fall
        into the trap again.  || 39 ||   She calls out, &quot;Brother,
        O brother - stay, O brother!&quot;  But he becomes a stranger.
        Her brother departs for his own home, and his sister burns with
        the pain of separation. In this world, her father's home,
        the daughter, the innocent soul bride, loves her Young Husband
        Lord. If you long for your Husband Lord, O soul bride, then serve
        the True Guru with love. How rare are the spiritually wise, who
        meet the True Guru, and truly understand. All glorious greatness
        rests in the Lord and Master's Hands. He grants them, when
        He is pleased. How rare are those who contemplate the Word of
        the Guru's Bani; they become Gurmukh. This is the Bani
        of the Supreme Being; through it, one dwells within the home of
        his inner being.  || 40 ||   Shattering and breaking apart, He
        creates and re-creates; creating, He shatters again. He builds
        up what He has demolished, and demolishes what He has built. He
        dries up the pools which are full, and fills the dried tanks again.
        He is all-powerful and independent. Deluded by doubt, they have
        gone insane; without destiny, what do they obtain? The Gurmukhs
        know that God holds the string; wherever He pulls it, they must
        go. Those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, are forever
        imbued with His Love; they never again feel regret.   Bhabha:
        If someone seeks, and then becomes Gurmukh, then he comes to
        dwell in the home of his own heart.   Bhabha:  The way of the
        terrifying world-ocean is treacherous. Remain free of hope, in
        the midst of hope, and you shall cross over. By Guru's
        Grace, one comes to understand himself; in this way, he remains
        dead while yet alive.  || 41 ||   Crying out for the wealth and
        riches of Maya, they die; but Maya does not go along with them.
        The soul-swan arises and departs, sad and depressed, leaving its
        wealth behind. The false mind is hunted by the Messenger of Death;
        it carries its faults along when it goes. The mind turns inward,
        and merges with mind, when it is with virtue. <br>

      <p> Crying out, &quot;Mine, mine!&quot;, they have died, but without
        the Name, they find only pain. So where are their forts, mansions,
        palaces and courts? They are like a short story. O Nanak, without
        the True Name, the false just come and go. He Himself is clever
        and so very beautiful; He Himself is wise and all-knowing.  ||
        42 ||   Those who come, must go in the end; they come and go,
        regretting and repenting. They will pass through 8.4 millions
        species; this number does not decrease or rise. They alone are
        saved, who love the Lord. Their worldly entanglements are ended,
        and Maya is conquered. Whoever is seen, shall depart; who should
        I make my friend? I dedicate my soul, and place my body and mind
        in offering before Him. You are eternally stable, O Creator, Lord
        and Master; I lean on Your Support. Conquered by virtue, egotism
        is killed; imbued with the Word of the Shabad, the mind rejects
        the world.  || 43 ||   Neither the kings nor the nobles will remain;
        neither the rich nor the poor will remain. When one's turn
        comes, no one can stay here. The path is difficult and treacherous;
        the pools and mountains are impassable. My body is filled with
        faults; I am dying of grief. Without virtue, how can I enter my
        home? The virtuous take virtue, and meet God; how can I meet them
        with love? If ony I could be like them, chanting and meditating
        within my heart on the Lord. He is overflowing with faults and
        demerits, but virtue dwells within him as well. Without the True
        Guru, he does not see God's Virtues; he does not chant
        the Glorious Virtues of God.  || 44 ||   God's soldiers
        take care of their homes; their pay is pre-ordained, before they
        come into the world. They serve their Supreme Lord and Master,
        and obtain the profit. They renounce greed, avarice and evil,
        and forget them from their minds. In the fortress of the body,
        they announce the victory of their Supreme King; they are never
        ever vanquished. One who calls himself a servant of his Lord and
        Master, and yet speaks defiantly to Him, shall forfeit his pay,
        and not be seated upon the throne. Glorious greatness rests in
        the hands of my Beloved; He gives, according to the Pleasure of
        His Will. He Himself does everything; who else should we address?
        No one else does anything.  || 45 ||   I cannot conceive of any
        other, who could be seated upon the royal cushions. The Supreme
        Man of men eradicates hell; He is True, and True is His Name.
        I wandered around searching for Him in the forests and meadows;
        I contemplate Him within my mind. The treasures of myriads of
        pearls, jewels and emeralds are in the hands of the True Guru.
        Meeting with God, I am exalted and elevated; I love the One Lord
        single-mindedly. O Nanak, one who lovingly meets with his Beloved,
        earns profit in the world hereafter. He who created and formed
        the creation, made your form as well. As Gurmukh, meditate on
        the Infinite Lord, who has no end or limitation.  || 46 ||   Rharha:
        The Dear Lord is beautiful; There is no other king, except Him.
        Rharha:  Listen to the spell, and the Lord will come to dwell
        in your mind. By Guru's Grace, one finds the Lord; do not
        be deluded by doubt. He alone is the true banker, who has the
        capital of the wealth of the Lord. The Gurmukh is perfect -
        applaud him! <br>

      <p> Through the beautiful Word of the Guru's Bani, the Lord
        is obtained; contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        Self-conceit is eliminated, and pain is eradicated; the soul bride
        obtains her Husband Lord.  || 47 ||   He hoards gold and silver,
        but this wealth is false and poisonous, nothing more than ashes.
        He calls himself a banker, gathering wealth, but he is ruined
        by his dual-mindedness. The truthful ones gather Truth; the True
        Name is priceless. The Lord is immaculate and pure; through Him,
        their honor is true, and their speech is true. You are my friend
        and companion, all-knowing Lord; You are the lake, and You are
        the swan. I am a sacrifice to that being, whose mind is filled
        with the True Lord and Master. Know the One who created love and
        attachment to Maya, the Enticer. One who realizes the all-knowing
        Primal Lord, looks alike upon poison and nectar.  || 48 ||   Without
        patience and forgiveness, countless hundreds of thousands have
        perished. Their numbers cannot be counted; how could I count them?
        Bothered and bewildered, uncounted numbers have died. One who
        realizes his Lord and Master is set free, and not bound by chains.
        Through the Word of the Shabad, enter the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence; you shall be blessed with patience, forgiveness, truth
        and peace. Partake of the true wealth of meditation, and the Lord
        Himself shall abide within your body. With mind, body and mouth,
        chant His Glorious Virtues forever; courage and composure shall
        enter deep within your mind. Through egotism, one is distracted
        and ruined; other than the Lord, all things are corrupt. Forming
        His creatures, He placed Himself within them; the Creator is unattached
        and infinite.  || 49 ||   No one knows the mystery of the Creator
        of the World. Whatever the Creator of the World does, is certain
        to occur. For wealth, some meditate on the Lord. By pre-ordained
        destiny, wealth is obtained. For the sake of wealth, some become
        servants or thieves. Wealth does not go along with them when they
        die; it passes into the hands of others. Without Truth, honor
        is not obtained in the Court of the Lord. Drinking in the subtle
        essence of the Lord, one is emancipated in the end.  || 50 ||
        Seeing and perceiving, O my companions, I am wonder-struck and
        amazed. My egotism, which proclaimed itself in possessiveness
        and self-conceit, is dead. My mind chants the Word of the Shabad,
        and attains spiritual wisdom. I am so tired of wearing all these
        necklaces, hair-ties and bracelets, and decorating myself. Meeting
        with my Beloved, I have found peace; now, I wear the necklace
        of total virtue. O Nanak, the Gurmukh attains the Lord, with love
        and affection. Without the Lord, who has found peace? Reflect
        upon this in your mind, and see. Read about the Lord, understand
        the Lord, and enshrine love for the Lord. Chant the Lord's
        Name, and meditate on the Lord; hold tight to the Support of the
        Name of the Lord.  || 51 ||   The inscription inscribed by the
        Creator Lord cannot be erased, O my companions. He who created
        the universe, in His Mercy, installs His Feet within us. Glorious
        greatness rests in the Hands of the Creator; reflect upon the
        Guru, and understand this. This inscription cannot be challenged.
        As it pleases You, You care for me. By Your Glance of Grace, I
        have found peace; O Nanak, reflect upon the Shabad. The self-willed
        manmukhs are confused; they rot away and die. Only by reflecting
        upon the Guru can they be saved. What can anyone say, about that
        Primal Lord, who cannot be seen? I am a sacrifice to my Guru,
        who has revealed Him to me, within my own heart.  || 52 ||   That
        Pandit, that religious scholar, is said to be well-educated, if
        he contemplates knowledge with intuitive ease. <br>

      <p> Considering his knowledge, he finds the essence of reality, and
        lovingly focuses his attention on the Name of the Lord. The self-willed
        manmukh sells his knowledge; he earns poison, and eats poison.
        The fool does not think of the Word of the Shabad. He has no understanding,
        no comprehension.  || 53 ||   That Pandit is called Gurmukh, who
        imparts understanding to his students. Contemplate the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord; gather in the Naam, and earn the true profit
        in this world. With the true notebook of the true mind, study
        the most sublime Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, he alone is learned,
        and he alone is a wise Pandit, who wears the necklace of the Lord's
        Name.  || 54 || 1 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The Siddhas formed an assembly; sitting in
        their Yogic postures, they shouted, &quot;Salute this gathering
        of Saints.&quot; I offer my salutation to the One who is true,
        infinite and incomparably beautiful. I cut off my head, and offer
        it to Him; I dedicate my body and mind to Him. O Nanak, meeting
        with the Saints, Truth is obtained, and one is spontaneously blessed
        with distinction.  || 1 ||   What is the use of wandering around?
        Purity comes only through Truth. Without the True Word of the
        Shabad, no one finds liberation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   &quot;Who
        are you? What is your name? What is your way? What is your goal?
        We pray that you will answer us truthfully; we are a sacrifice
        to the humble Saints. Where is your seat? Where do you live, boy?
        Where did you come from, and where are you going? Tell us, Nanak
        - the detached Siddhas wait to hear your reply. What is
        your path?&quot;  || 2 ||   He dwells deep within the nucleus
        of each and every heart. This is my seat and my home. I walk in
        harmony with the Will of the True Guru. I came from the Celestial
        Lord God; I go wherever He orders me to go. I am Nanak, forever
        under the Command of His Will. I sit in the posture of the eternal,
        imperishable Lord. These are the Teachings I have received from
        the Guru. As Gurmukh, I have come to understand and realize myself;
        I merge in the Truest of the True.  || 3 ||   &quot;The world-ocean
        is treacherous and impassable; how can one cross over? Charpat
        the Yogi says, O Nanak, think it over, and give us your true reply.&quot;
        What answer can I give to someone, who claims to understand himself?
        I speak the Truth; if you have already crossed over, how can I
        argue with you?  || 4 ||   The lotus flower floats untouched upon
        the surface of the water, and the duck swims through the stream;
        with one's consciousness focused on the Word of the Shabad,
        one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. O Nanak, chant the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. One who lives alone, as a hermit,
        enshring the One Lord in his mind, remaining unaffected by hope
        in the midst of hope, sees and inspires others to see the inaccessible,
        unfathomable Lord. Nanak is his slave.  || 5 ||   &quot;Listen,
        Lord, to our prayer. We seek your true opinion. Don't be
        angry with us - please tell us: How can we find the Guru's
        Door?&quot; This fickle mind sits in its true home, O Nanak,
        through the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Creator
        Himself unites us in Union, and inspires us to love the Truth.
        || 6 ||   &quot;Away from stores and highways, we live in the
        woods, among plants and trees. For food, we take fruits and roots. <br>

      <p> This is the spiritual wisdom spoken by the renunciates. We bathe
        at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and obtain the fruits of peace;
        not even an iota of filth sticks to us. Luhaareepaa, the disciple
        of Gorakh says, this is the Way of Yoga.&quot;  || 7 ||   In
        the stores and on the road, do not sleep; do not let your consciousness
        covet anyone else's home. Without the Name, the mind has
        no firm support; O Nanak, this hunger never departs. The Guru
        has revealed the stores and the city within the home of my own
        heart, where I intuitively carry on the true trade. Sleep little,
        and eat little; O Nanak, this is the essence of wisdom.  || 8
        ||   &quot;Wear the robes of the sect of Yogis who follow Gorakh;
        put on the ear-rings, begging wallet and patched coat. Among the
        twelve schools of Yoga, ours is the highest; among the six schools
        of philosophy, ours is the best path. This is the way to instruct
        the mind, so you will never suffer beatings again.&quot; Nanak
        speaks: the Gurmukh understands; this is the way that Yoga is
        attained.  || 9 ||   Let constant absorption in the Word of the
        Shabad deep within be your ear-rings; eradicate egotism and attachment.
        Discard sexual desire, anger and egotism, and through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, attain true understanding. For your
        patched coat and begging bowl, see the Lord God pervading and
        permeating everywhere; O Nanak, the One Lord will carry you across.
        True is our Lord and Master, and True is His Name. Analyze it,
        and you shall find the Word of the Guru to be True.  || 10 ||
        Let your mind turn away in detachment from the world, and let
        this be your begging bowl. Let the lessons of the five elements
        be your cap. Let the body be your meditation mat, and the mind
        your loin cloth. Let truth, contentment and self-discipline be
        your companions. O Nanak, the Gurmukh dwells on the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord.  || 11 ||   &quot;Who is hidden? Who is liberated?
        Who is united, inwardly and outwardly? Who comes, and who goes?
        Who is permeating and pervading the three worlds?&quot;  || 12
        ||   He is hidden within each and every heart. The Gurmukh is
        liberated. Through the Word of the Shabad, one is united, inwardly
        and outwardly. The self-willed manmukh perishes, and comes and
        goes. O Nanak, the Gurmukh merges in Truth.  || 13 ||   &quot;How
        is one placed in bondage, and consumed by the sepent of Maya?
        How does one lose, and how does one gain? How does one become
        immaculate and pure? How is the darkness of ignorance removed?
        One who understands this essence of reality is our Guru.&quot;
        || 14 ||   Man is bound by evil-mindedness, and consumed by Maya,
        the serpent. The self-willed manmukh loses, and the Gurmukh gains.
        Meeting the True Guru, darkness is dispelled. O Nanak, eradicating
        egotism, one merges in the Lord.  || 15 ||   Focused deep within,
        in perfect absorption, the soul-swan does not fly away, and the
        body-wall does not collapse. Then, one knows that his true home
        is in the cave of intuitive poise. O Nanak, the True Lord loves
        those who are truthful.  || 16 ||   &quot;Why have you left
        your house and become a wandering Udaasee? Why have you adopted
        these religious robes? What merchandise do you trade? How will
        you carry others across with you?&quot;  || 17 ||   I became
        a wandering Udaasee, searching for the Gurmukhs. I have adopted
        these robes seeking the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
        I trade in the merchandise of Truth. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, I carry
        others across.  || 18 ||   &quot;How have you changed the course
        of your life? With what have you linked your mind? <br>

      <p> How have you subdued your hopes and desires? How have you found
        the Light deep within your nucleus? Without teeth, how can you
        eat iron? Give us your true opinion, Nanak.&quot;  || 19 || 
        Born into the House of the True Guru, my wandering in reincarnation
        ended. My mind is attached and attuned to the unstruck sound current.
        Through the Word of the Shabad, my hopes and desires have been
        burnt away. As Gurmukh, I found the Light deep within the nucleus
        of my self. Eradicating the three qualities, one eats iron. O
        Nanak, the Emancipator emancipates.  || 20 ||   &quot;What can
        you tell us about the beginning? In what home did the absolute
        dwell then? What are the ear-rings of spiritual wisdom? Who dwells
        in each and every heart? How can one avoid the attack of death?
        How can one enter the home of fearlessness? How can one know the
        posture of intuition and contentment, and overcome one's
        adversaries?&quot; Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        egotism and corruption are conquered, and then one comes to dwell
        in the home of the self within. One who realizes the Shabad of
        the One who created the creation - Nanak is his slave.
        || 21 ||   &quot;Where did we come from? Where are we going?
        Where will we be absorbed? One who reveals the meaning of this
        Shabad is the Guru, who has no greed at all. How can one find
        the essence of the unmanifest reality? How does one become Gurmukh,
        and enshrine love for the Lord? He Himself is consciousness, He
        Himself is the Creator; share with us, Nanak, your wisdom.&quot;
        By His Command we come, and by His Command we go; by His Command,
        we merge in absorption. Through the Perfect Guru, live the Truth;
        through the Word of the Shabad, the state of dignity is attained.
        || 22 ||   We can only express a sense of wonder about the beginning.
        The absolute abided endlessly deep within Himself then. Consider
        freedom from desire to be the ear-rings of the Guru's spiritual
        wisdom. The True Lord, the Soul of all, dwells within each and
        every heart. Through the Guru's Word, one merges in the
        absolute, and intuitively receives the immaculate essence. O Nanak,
        that Sikh who seeks and finds the Way does not serve any other.
        Wonderful and amazing is His Command; He alone realizes His Command
        and knows the true way of life of His creatures. One who eradicates
        his self-conceit becomes free of desire; he alone is a Yogi, who
        enshrines the True Lord deep within.  || 23 ||   From His state
        of absolute existence, He assumed the immaculate form; from formless,
        He assumed the supreme form. By pleasing the True Guru, the supreme
        status is obtained, and one is absorbed in the True Word of the
        Shabad. He knows the True Lord as the One and only; he sends his
        egotism and duality far away. He alone is a Yogi, who realizes
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad; the lotus of the heart blossoms
        forth within. If one remains dead while yet alive, then he understands
        everything; he knows the Lord deep within himself, who is kind
        and compassionate to all. O Nanak, he is blessed with glorious
        greatness; he realizes himself in all beings.  || 24 ||   We emerge
        from Truth, and merge into Truth again. The pure being merges
        into the One True Lord. The false come, and find no place of rest;
        in duality, they come and go. This coming and going in reincarnation
        is ended through the Word of the Guru's Shabad; the Lord
        Himself analyzes and grants His forgiveness. <br>

      <p> One who suffers from the disease of duality, forgets the Naam,
        the source of nectar. He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires
        to understand. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one
        is liberated. O Nanak, the Emancipator emancipates one who drives
        out egotism and duality.  || 25 ||   The self-willed manmukhs
        are deluded, under the shadow of death. They look into the homes
        of others, and lose. The manmukhs are confused by doubt, wandering
        in the wilderness. Having lost their way, they are plundered;
        they chant their mantras at cremation grounds. They do not think
        of the Shabad; instead, they utter obscenities. O Nanak, those
        who are attuned to the Truth know peace.  || 26 ||   The Gurmukh
        lives in the Fear of God, the True Lord. Through the Word of the
        Guru's Bani, the Gurmukh refines the unrefined. The Gurmukh
        sings the immaculate, Glorious Praises of the Lord. The Gurmukh
        attains the supreme, sanctified status. The Gurmukh meditates
        on the Lord with every hair of his body. O Nanak, the Gurmukh
        merges in Truth.  || 27 ||   The Gurmukh is pleasing to the True
        Guru; this is contemplation on the Vedas. Pleasing the True Guru,
        the Gurmukh is carried across. Pleasing the True Guru, the Gurmukh
        receives the spiritual wisdom of the Shabad. Pleasing the True
        Guru, the Gurmukh comes to know the path within. The Gurmukh attains
        the unseen and infinite Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the door
        of liberation.  || 28 ||   The Gurmukh speaks the unspoken wisdom.
        In the midst of his family, the Gurmukh lives a spiritual life.
        The Gurmukh lovingly meditates deep within. The Gurmukh obtains
        the Shabad, and righteous conduct. He knows the mystery of the
        Shabad, and inspires others to know it. O Nanak, burning away
        his ego, he merges in the Lord.  || 29 ||   The True Lord fashioned
        the earth for the sake of the Gurmukhs. There, he set in motion
        the play of creation and destruction. One who is filled with the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad enshrines love for the Lord.
        Attuned to the Truth, he goes to his home with honor. Without
        the True Word of the Shabad, no one receives honor. O Nanak, without
        the Name, how can one be absorbed in Truth?  || 30 ||   The Gurmukh
        obtains the eight miraculous spiritual powers, and all wisdom.
        The Gurmukh crosses over the terrifying world-ocean, and obtains
        true understanding. The Gurmukh knows the ways of truth and untruth.
        The Gurmukh knows worldliness and renunciation. The Gurmukh crosses
        over, and carries others across as well. O Nanak, the Gurmukh
        is emancipated through the Shabad.  || 31 ||   Attuned to the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, egotism is dispelled. Attuned to the
        Naam, they remain absorbed in the True Lord. Attuned to the Naam,
        they contemplate the Way of Yoga. Attuned to the Naam, they find
        the door of liberation. Attuned to the Naam, they understand the
        three worlds. O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, eternal peace is found.
        || 32 ||   Attuned to the Naam, they attain Sidh Gosht -
        conversation with the Siddhas. Attuned to the Naam, they practice
        intense meditation forever. Attuned to the Naam, they live the
        true and excellent lifestyle. Attuned to the Naam, they contemplate
        the Lord's virtues and spiritual wisdom. Without the Name,
        all that is spoken is useless. O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, their
        victory is celebrated.  || 33 ||   Through the Perfect Guru, one
        obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Way of Yoga is to
        remain absorbed in Truth. The Yogis wander in the twelve schools
        of Yoga; the Sannyaasis in six and four. One who remains dead
        while yet alive, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        finds the door of liberation. </p>
