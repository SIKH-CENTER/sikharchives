      <p> Enshrine love for the True Guru, and then you shall obtain this
        understanding.  || 7 ||   This is not Yoga, O Yogi, to abandon
        your family and wander around. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        is within the household of the body. By Guru's Grace, you
        shall find your Lord God.  || 8 ||   This world is a puppet of
        clay, Yogi; the terrible disease, the desire for Maya is in it.
        Making all sorts of efforts, and wearing religious robes, Yogi,
        this disease cannot be cured.  || 9 ||   The Name of the Lord
        is the medicine, Yogi; the Lord enshrines it in the mind. One
        who becomes Gurmukh understands this; he alone finds the Way of
        Yoga.  || 10 ||   The Path of Yoga is very difficult, Yogi; he
        alone finds it, whom God blesses with His Grace. Inside and outside,
        he sees the One Lord; he eliminates doubt from within himself.
        || 11 ||   So play the harp which vibrates without being played,
        Yogi. Says Nanak, thus you shall be liberated, Yogi, and remain
        merged in the True Lord.  || 12 || 1 || 10 ||   RAAMKALEE,  THIRD
        MEHL:  The treasure of devotional worship is revealed to the Gurmukh;
        the True Guru has inspired me to understand this understanding.
        || 1 ||   O Saints, the Gurmukh is blessed with glorious greatness.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Dwelling always in Truth, celestial peace
        wells up; sexual desire and anger are eliminated from within.
        || 2 ||   Eradicating self-conceit, remain lovingly focused on
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the Word of the Shabad,
        burn away possessiveness.  || 3 ||   By Him we are created, and
        by Him we are destroyed; in the end, the Naam will be our only
        help and support.  || 4 ||   He is ever-present; don't
        think that He is far away. He created the creation.  || 5 || 
        Deep within your heart, chant the True Word of the Shabad; remain
        lovingly absorbed in the True Lord.  || 6 ||   The Priceless Naam
        is in the Society of the Saints; by great good fortune, it is
        obtained.  || 7 ||   Do not be deluded by doubt; serve the True
        Guru, and keep your mind steady in one place.  || 8 ||   Without
        the Name, everyone wanders around in confusion; they waste away
        their lives in vain.  || 9 ||   Yogi, you have lost the Way; you
        wander around confused. Through hypocrisy, Yoga is not attained.
        || 10 ||   Sitting in Yogic postures in the City of God, through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall find Yoga.  ||
        11 ||   Restrain your restless wanderings through the Shabad,
        and the Naam will come to dwell in your mind.  || 12 ||   This
        body is a pool, O Saints; bathe in it, and enshrine love for the
        Lord.  || 13 ||   Those who cleanse themselves through the Naam,
        are the most immaculate people; through the Shabad, they wash
        off their filth.  || 14 ||   Trapped by the three qualities, the
        unconscious person does not think of the Naam; without the Name,
        he wastes away.  || 15 ||   The three forms of Brahma, Vishnu
        and Shiva are trapped in the three qualities, lost in confusion.
        || 16 ||   By Guru's Grace, this triad is eradicated,
        and one is lovingly absorbed in the fourth state.  || 17 ||  
        The Pandits, the religious scholars, read, study and discuss the
        arguments; they do not understand.  || 18 ||   Engrossed in corruption,
        they wander in confusion; who can they possibly instruct, O Siblings
        of Destiny?  || 19 ||   The Bani, the Word of the humble devotee
        is the most sublime and exalted; it prevails throughout the ages.
        || 20 || <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> One who is committed to this Bani is emancipated, and through
        the Shabad, merges in Truth.  || 21 ||   One who searches the
        village of the body, through the Shabad, obtains the nine treasures
        of the Naam.  || 22 ||   Conquering desire, the mind is absorbed
        in intuitive ease, and then one chants the Lord's Praises
        without speaking.  || 23 ||   Let your eyes gaze upon the Wondrous
        Lord; let your consciousness be attached to the Unseen Lord. 
        || 24 ||   The Unseen Lord is forever absolute and immaculate;
        one's light merges into the Light.  || 25 ||   I praise
        my Guru forever, who has inspired me to understand this true understanding.
        || 26 ||   Nanak offers this one prayer: through the Name, may
        I find salvation and honor.  || 27 || 2 || 11 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        THIRD MEHL:  It is so hard to obtain that devotional worship
        of the Lord, O Saints. It cannot be described at all.  || 1 ||
        O Saints, as Gurmukh, find the Perfect Lord, and worship the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without the
        Lord, everything is filthy, O Saints; what offering should I place
        before Him?  || 2 ||   Whatever pleases the True Lord is devotional
        worship; His Will abides in the mind.  || 3 ||   Everyone worships
        Him, O Saints, but the self-willed manmukh is not accepted or
        approved.  || 4 ||   If someone dies in the Word of the Shabad,
        his mind become immaculate, O Saints; such worship is accepted
        and approved.  || 5 ||   Sanctified and pure are those true beings,
        who enshrine love for the Shabad.  || 6 ||   There is no worship
        of the Lord, other than the Name; the world wanders, deluded by
        doubt.  || 7 ||   The Gurmukh understands his own self, O Saints;
        he lolvingly centers his mind on the Lord's Name.  || 8
        ||   The Immaculate Lord Himself inspires worship of Him; through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is accepted and approved.
        || 9 ||   Those who worship Him, but do not know the Way, are
        polluted with the love of duality.  || 10 ||   One who becomes
        Gurmukh, knows what worship is; the Lord's Will abides
        within his mind.  || 11 ||   One who accepts the Lord's
        Will obtains total peace, O Saints; in the end, the Naam will
        be our help and support.  || 12 ||   One who does not understand
        his own self, O Saints, falsely flatters himself.  || 13 ||  
        The Messenger of Death does not give up on those who practices
        hypocrisy; they are dragged away in disgrace.  || 14 ||   Those
        who have the Shabad deep within, understand themselves; they find
        the way of salvation.  || 15 ||   Their minds enter into the deepest
        state of Samaadhi, and their light is absorbed into the Light.
        || 16 ||   The Gurmukhs listen constantly to the Naam, and chant
        it in the True Congregation.  || 17 ||   The Gurmukhs sing the
        Lord's Praises, and erase self-conceit; they obtain true
        honor in the Court of the Lord.  || 18 ||   True are their words;
        they speak only the Truth; they lovingly focus on the True Name.
        || 19 ||   My God is the Destroyer of fear, the Destroyer of
        sin; in the end, He is our only help and support.  || 20 ||  
        He Himself pervades and permeates everything; O Nanak, glorious
        greatness is obtained through the Naam.  || 21 || 3 || 12 || 
        RAAMKALEE,  THIRD MEHL:  I am filthy and polluted, proud and
        egotistical; receiving the Word of the Shabad, my filth is taken
        away.  || 1 ||   O Saints, the Gurmukhs are saved through the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. The True Name abides deep within their
        hearts. The Creator Himself embellishes them. <br>

      </p>
      <p> || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Touching the philosopher's stone,
        they themselves become the philosopher's stone; the Dear
        Lord Himself blesses them with His Mercy.  || 2 ||   Some wear
        religious robes, and wander around in pride; they lose their life
        in the gamble.  || 3 ||   Some worship the Lord in devotion, night
        and day; day and night, they keep the Lord's Name enshrined
        in their hearts.  || 4 ||   Those who are imbued with Him night
        and day, are spontaneously intoxicated with Him; they intuitively
        conquer their ego.  || 5 ||   Without the Fear of God, devotional
        worship is never performed; through the Love and the Fear of God,
        devotional worship is embellished.  || 6 ||   The Shabad burns
        away emotional attachment to Maya, and then one contemplates the
        essence of spiritual wisdom.  || 7 ||   The Creator Himself inspires
        us to act; He Himself blesses us with His treasure.  || 8 || 
        The limits of His virtues cannot be found; I sing His Praises
        and contemplate the Word of the Shabad.  || 9 ||   I chant the
        Lord's Name, and praise my Dear Lord; egotism is eradicated
        from within me.  || 10 ||   The treasure of the Naam is obtained
        from the Guru; the treasures of the True Lord are inexhaustible.
        || 11 ||   He Himself is pleased with His devotees; by His Grace,
        He infuses His strength within them.  || 12 ||   They always feel
        hunger for the True Name; they sing and contemplate the Shabad.
        || 13 ||   Soul, body and everything are His; it is so difficult
        to speak of, and contemplate Him.  || 14 ||   Those humble beings
        who are attached to the Shabad are saved; they cross over the
        terrifying world-ocean.  || 15 ||   Without the True Lord, no
        one can cross over; how rare are those who contemplate and understand
        this.  || 16 ||   We obtain only that which is pre-ordained; receiving
        the Lord's Shabad, we are embellished.  || 17 ||   Imbued
        with the Shabad, the body becomes golden, and loves only the True
        Name.  || 18 ||   The body is then filled to overflowing with
        Ambrosial Nectar, obtained by contemplating the Shabad.  || 19
        ||   Those who seek God, find Him; others burst and die from their
        own egotism.  || 20 ||   The debaters waste away, while the servants
        serve, with love and affection for the Guru.  || 21 ||   He alone
        is a Yogi, who contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom, and
        conquers egotism and thirsty desire.  || 22 ||   The True Guru,
        the Great Giver, is revealed to those upon whom You bestow Your
        Grace, O Lord.  || 23 ||   Those who do not serve the True Guru,
        and who are attached to Maya, are drowned; they die in their own
        egotism.  || 24 ||   As long as there is breath within you, so
        long you should serve the Lord; then, you will go and meet the
        Lord.  || 25 ||   Night and day, she remains awake and aware,
        day and night; she is the darling bride of her Beloved Husband
        Lord.  || 26 ||   I offer my body and mind in sacrifice to my
        Guru; I am a sacrifice to Him.  || 27 ||   Attachment to Maya
        will end and go away; only by contemplating the Shabad will you
        be saved.  || 28 ||   They are awake and aware, whom the Lord
        Himself awakens; so contemplate the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 29 ||   O Nanak, those who do not remember the Naam
        are dead. The devotees live in contemplative meditation.  || 30
        || 4 || 13 ||   RAAMKALEE,  THIRD MEHL:  Receiving the treasure
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, from the Guru, I remain satisfied
        and fulfilled.  || 1 || <br>

      <p> O Saints, the Gurmukhs attain the state of liberation. The One
        Name abides deep within my heart; such is the glorious greatness
        of the Perfect Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself is the Creator,
        and He Himself is the Enjoyer. He Himself gives sustenance to
        all.  || 2 ||   Whatever He wants to do, He is doing; no one else
        can do anything.  || 3 ||   He Himself fashions and creates the
        creation; He links each and every person to their task.  || 4
        ||   If you serve Him, then you will find peace; the True Guru
        will unite you in His Union.  || 5 ||   The Lord Himself creates
        Himself; the Unseen Lord cannot be seen.  || 6 ||   He Himself
        kills, and brings back to life; He does not have even an iota
        of greed.  || 7 ||   Some are made givers, and some are made beggars;
        He Himself inspires us to devotional worship.  || 8 ||   Those
        who know the One Lord are very fortunate; they remain absorbed
        in the True Lord.  || 9 ||   He Himself is beautiful, He Himself
        is wise and clever; His worth cannot be expressed.  || 10 || 
        He Himself infuses pain and pleasure; He Himself makes them wander
        around in doubt.  || 11 ||   The Great Giver is revealed to the
        Gurmukh; without the Guru, the world wanders in darkness.  ||
        12 ||   Those who taste, enjoy the flavor; the True Guru imparts
        this understanding.  || 13 ||   Some, the Lord causes to forget
        and lose the Name; others become Gurmukh, and are granted this
        understanding.  || 14 ||   Forever and ever, praise the Lord,
        O Saints; how glorious is His greatness!  || 15 ||   There is
        no other King except Him; He administers justice, as He has made
        it.  || 16 ||   His justice is always True; how rare are those
        who accept His Command.  || 17 ||   O mortal, meditate forever
        on the Lord, who has made the Gurmukh in His making.  || 18 ||
        That humble being who meets with the True Guru is fulfilled;
        the Naam abides in his heart.  || 19 ||   The True Lord is Himself
        forever True; He announces His Bani, the Word of His Shabad. 
        || 20 ||   Nanak is wonderstruck, hearing and seeing His Lord;
        my God is all-pervading, everywhere.  || 21 || 5 || 14 || <br>

      <p> Some pass their lives with their mothers, fathers and children.
        Some pass their lives in power, estates and trade. The Saints
        pass their lives with the support of the Lord's Name. 
        || 1 ||   The world is the creation of the True Lord. He alone
        is the Master of all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Some pass their lives
        in arguments and debates about scriptures. Some pass their lives
        tasting flavors. Some pass their lives attached to women. The
        Saints are absorbed only in the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   Some
        pass their lives gambling. Some pass their lives getting drunk.
        Some pass their lives stealing the property of others. The humble
        servants of the Lord pass their lives meditating on the Naam.
        || 3 ||   Some pass their lives in Yoga, strict meditation, worship
        and adoration. Some, in sickness, sorrow and doubt. Some pass
        their lives practicing control of the breath. The Saints pass
        their lives singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. 
        || 4 ||   Some pass their lives walking day and night. Some pass
        their lives on the fields of battle. Some pass their lives teaching
        children. The Saints pass their lives singing the Lord's
        Praise.  || 5 ||   Some pass their lives as actors, acting and
        dancing. Some pass their lives taking the lives of others. Some
        pass their lives ruling by intimidation. The Saints pass their
        lives chanting the Lord's Praises.  || 6 ||   Some pass
        their lives counseling and giving advice. Some pass their lives
        forced to serve others. Some pass their lives exploring life's
        mysteries. The Saints pass their lives drinking in the sublime
        essence of the Lord.  || 7 ||   As the Lord attaches us, so we
        are attached. No one is foolish, and no one is wise. Nanak is
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those who are blessed by His Grace
        to receive His Name.  || 8 || 3 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        Even in a forest fire, some trees remain green. The infant is
        released from the pain of the mother's womb. Meditating
        in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, fear is dispelled.
        Just so, the Sovereign Lord protects and saves the Saints.  ||
        1 ||   Such is the Merciful Lord, my Protector. Wherever I look,
        I see You cherishing and nurturing.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As thirst
        is quenched by drinking water; as the bride blossoms forth when
        her husband comes home; as wealth is the support of the greedy
        person - just so, the humble servant of the Lord loves
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 2 ||   As the farmer protects
        his fields; as the mother and father show compassion to their
        child; as the lover merges on seeing the beloved; just so does
        the Lord hug His humble servant close in His Embrace.  || 3 ||
        As the blind man is in ecstasy, when he can see again; and the
        mute, when he is able to speak and sing songs; and the cripple,
        being able to climb over the mountain - just so, the Name
        of the Lord saves all.  || 4 ||   As cold is dispelled by fire,
        sins are driven out in the Society of the Saints. As cloth is
        cleaned by soap, just so, by chanting the Naam, all doubts and
        fears are dispelled.  || 5 ||   As the chakvi bird longs for the
        sun, as the sparrow-hawk thirsts for the rain drop, as the deer's
        ears are attuned to the sound of the bell, the Lord's Name
        is pleasing to the mind of the Lord's humble servant. <br>

      <p> || 6 ||   By Your Grace, we love You. When You show Mercy, then
        You come into our minds. When the Support of the earth granted
        His Grace, then I was released from my bonds.  || 7 ||   I have
        seen all places with my eyes wide open. There is no other than
        Him. Doubt and fear are dispelled, by Guru's Grace. Nanak

        FIFTH MEHL:  All beings and creatures that are seen, God, depend
        on Your Support.  || 1 ||   This mind is saved through the Name
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In an instant, He establishes
        and disestablishes, by His Creative Power. All is the Creation
        of the Creator.  || 2 ||   Sexual desire, anger, greed, falsehood
        and slander are banished in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy.  || 3 ||   Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the
        mind becomes immaculate, and life is passed in absolute peace.
        || 4 ||   That mortal who enters the Sanctuary of the devotees,
        does not lose out, here or hereafter.  || 5 ||   Pleasure and
        pain, and the condition of this mind, I place before You, Lord.
        || 6 ||   You are the Giver of all beings; You cherish what You
        have made.  || 7 ||   So many millions of times, Nanak is a sacrifice
        to Your humble servants.  || 8 || 5 || <br>

        My Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Giver of peace. He implants
        the Naam, the Name of the Supreme Lord God within us; in the end,
        He is our help and support.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The source of

        The Lord is all-powerful, the Cause of causes. Nanak seeks His
        Sanctuary.  || 4 ||   Shattering the bonds, the Guru implants

        the One Word of the Shabad.  || 5 ||   He has lifted me up, and
        pulled me out of the deep, dark pit of sin; I am attuned to the

        I shall never wander again.  || 7 ||   This mind is imbued with
        the sublime elixir of the Naam; drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar,
        it is satisfied.  || 8 ||   Joining the Society of the Saints,
        I sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises; I dwell in the
        eternal, unchanging place.  || 9 ||   The Perfect Guru has given
        me the perfect teachings; there is nothing except the Lord, O
        Siblings of Destiny.  || 10 ||   I have obtained the treasure

        into hell.  || 11 ||   Clever tricks have not worked for me; I
        shall act according to the Instructions of the Perfect Guru. 
        || 12 ||   He is chanting, intense meditation, austere self-discipline
        and purification. He Himself acts, and causes us to act.  || 13

        to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  || 16 ||   The Lord
        Master is unlimited and endless; Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice
        to Him.  || 17 ||   Being of Immortal Manifestation, He is not
        born; He is self-existent; He is the Light in the darkness of
        Kali Yuga.  || 18 ||   He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of
        hearts, the Giver of souls; gazing upon Him, I am satisfied and
        fulfilled.  || 19 ||   He is the One Universal Creator Lord, immaculate
        and fearless; He is permeating and pervading all the water and
        the land.  || 20 ||   He blesses His devotees with the Gift of
        devotional worship; Nanak longs for the Lord, O my mother.  ||
        21 || 1 || 6 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL,  SHALOK:  Study the
        Word of the Shabad, O beloveds. It is your anchoring support in
        life and in death. Your face shall be radiant, and you will be
        at peace forever, O Nanak, meditating in remembrance on the One
        Lord. My mind and body are imbued with my Beloved Lord; I have
        been blessed with loving devotion to the Lord, O Saints.  || 1
        ||   The True Guru has approved my cargo, O Saints. He has blessed
        His slave with the profit of the Lord's Name; all my thirst
        is quenched, O Saints.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Searching and searching,
        I have found the One Lord, the jewel; I cannot express His value,
        O Saints.  || 2 ||   I focus my meditation on His Lotus Feet;
        I am absorbed in the True Vision of His Darshan, O Saints.  ||
        3 ||   Singing, singing His Glorious Praises, I am enraptured;
        meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I am satisfied and fulfilled,
        O Saints.  || 4 ||   The Lord, the Supreme Soul, is permeating
        within all; what comes, and what goes, O Saints?  || 5 ||   At
        the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, He is, and
        He shall always be; He is the Giver of peace to all beings, O
        Saints.  || 6 ||   He Himself is endless; His end cannot be found.
        He is totally pervading and permeating everywhere, O Saints. 
        || 7 ||   Nanak: the Lord is my friend, companion, wealth, youth,
        son, father and mother, O Saints.  || 8 || 2 || 7 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  In thought, word and deed, I contemplate the Lord's
        Name. The horrible world-ocean is very treacherous; O Nanak, the
        Gurmukh is carried across.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Inwardly, peace,
        and outwardly, peace; meditating on the Lord, evil tendencies
        are crushed.  || 1 ||   He has rid me of what was clinging to
        me; my Dear Lord God has blessed me with His Grace.  || 2 || 
        The Saints are saved, in His Sanctuary; the very egotistical
        people rot away and die.  || 3 ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, I have obtained this fruit, the Support of the One
        Name alone.  || 4 ||   No one is strong, and no one is weak; all
        are manifestations of Your Light, Lord.  || 5 ||   You are the
        all-powerful, indescribable, unfathomable, all-pervading Lord.
        || 6 ||   Who can estimate Your value, O Creator Lord? God has
        no end or limitation.  || 7 ||   Please bless Nanak with the glorious
        greatness of the gift of the Naam, and the dust of the feet of
        Your Saints.  || 8 || 3 || 8 || 22 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">I am in ecstasy, O my mother, for I have found
        my True Guru. I have found the True Guru, with intuitive ease,
        and my mind vibrates with the music of bliss. The jewelled melodies
        and their related celestial harmonies have come to sing the Word
        of the Shabad. The Lord dwells within the minds of those who sing
        the Shabad. Says Nanak, I am in ecstasy, for I have found my True
        Guru.  || 1 ||   O my mind, remain always with the Lord. Remain
        always with the Lord, O my mind, and all sufferings will be forgotten.
        He will accept You as His own, and all your affairs will be perfectly
        arranged. Our Lord and Master is all-powerful to do all things,
        so why forget Him from your mind? Says Nanak, O my mind, remain
        always with the Lord.  || 2 ||   O my True Lord and Master, what
        is there which is not in Your celestial home? Everything is in
        Your home; they receive, unto whom You give. Constantly singing
        Your Praises and Glories, Your Name is enshrined in the mind.
        The divine melody of the Shabad vibrates for those, within whose
        minds the Naam abides. Says Nanak, O my True Lord and Master,
        what is there which is not in Your home?  || 3 ||   The True Name
        is my only support. The True Name is my only support; it satisfies
        all hunger. It has brought peace and tranquility to my mind; it
        has fulfilled all my desires. I am forever a sacrifice to the
        Guru, who possesses such glorious greatness. Says Nanak, listen,
        O Saints; enshrine love for the Shabad. The True Name is my only
        support.  || 4 ||   The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds,
        vibrate in that blessed house. In that blessed house, the Shabad
        vibrates; He infuses His almighty power into it. Through You,
        we subdue the five demons of desire, and slay Death, the torturer.
        Those who have such pre-ordained destiny are attached to the Lord's
        Name. Says Nanak, they are at peace, and the unstruck sound current
        vibrates within their homes.  || 5 ||   Without the true love
        of devotion, the body is without honor. The body is dishonored
        without devotional love; what can the poor wretches do? No one
        except You is all-powerful; please bestow Your Mercy, O Lord of
        all nature. There is no place of rest, other than the Name; attached
        to the Shabad, we are embellished with beauty. Says Nanak, without
        devotional love, what can the poor wretches do?  || 6 ||   Bliss,
        bliss - everyone talks of bliss; bliss is known only through
        the Guru. Eternal bliss in known only through the Guru, when the
        Beloved Lord grants His Grace. Granting His Grace, He cuts away
        our sins; He blesses us with the healing ointment of spiritual
        wisdom. Those who eradicate attachment from within themselves,
        are adorned with the Shabad, the Word of the True Lord. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Says Nanak, this alone is bliss - bliss which is known
        through the Guru.  || 7 ||   O Baba, he alone receives it, unto
        whom You give it. He alone receives it, unto whom You give it;
        what can the other poor wretched beings do? Some are deluded by
        doubt, wandering in the ten directions; some are adorned with
        attachment to the Naam. By Guru's Grace, the mind becomes
        immaculate and pure, for those who follow God's Will. Says
        Nanak, he alone receives it, unto whom You give it, O Beloved
        Lord.  || 8 ||   Come, Beloved Saints, let us speak the Unspoken
        Speech of the Lord. How can we speak the Unspoken Speech of the
        Lord? Through which door will we find Him? Surrender body, mind,
        wealth, and everything to the Guru; obey the Order of His Will,
        and you will find Him. Obey the Hukam of the Guru's Command,
        and sing the True Word of His Bani. Says Nanak, listen, O Saints,
        and speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.  || 9 ||   O fickle
        mind, through cleverness, no one has found the Lord. Through cleverness,
        no one has found Him; listen, O my mind. This Maya is so fascinating;
        because of it, people wander in doubt. This fascinating Maya was
        created by the One who has administered this potion. I am a sacrifice
        to the One who has made emotional attachment sweet. Says Nanak,
        O fickle mind, no one has found Him through cleverness.  || 10
        ||   O beloved mind, contemplate the True Lord forever. This family
        which you see shall not go along with you. They shall not go along
        with you, so why do you focus your attention on them? Don't
        do anything that you will regret in the end. Listen to the Teachings
        of the True Guru - these shall go along with you. Says
        Nanak, O beloved mind, contemplate the True Lord forever.  ||
        11 ||   O inaccessible and unfathomable Lord, Your limits cannot
        be found. No one has found Your limits; only You Yourself know.
        All living beings and creatures are Your play; how can anyone
        describe You? You speak, and You gaze upon all; You created the
        Universe. Says Nanak, You are forever inaccessible; Your limits
        cannot be found.  || 12 ||   The angelic beings and the silent
        sages search for the Ambrosial Nectar; this Amrit is obtained
        from the Guru. This Amrit is obtained, when the Guru grants His
        Grace; He enshrines the True Lord within the mind. All living
        beings and creatures were created by You; only some come to see
        the Guru, and seek His blessing. Their greed, avarice and egotism
        are dispelled, and the True Guru seems sweet. Says Nanak, those
        with whom the Lord is pleased, obtain the Amrit, through the Guru.
        || 13 ||   The lifestyle of the devotees is unique and distinct.
        The devotees' lifestyle is unique and distinct; they follow
        the most difficult path. They renounce greed, avarice, egotism
        and desire; they do not talk too much. The path they take is sharper
        than a two-edged sword, and finer than a hair. <br>

        their hopes are merged in the Lord. Says Nanak, the lifestyle
        of the devotees, in each and every age, is unique and distinct.
        || 14 ||   As You make me walk, so do I walk, O my Lord and Master;
        what else do I know of Your Glorious Virtues? As You cause them
        to walk, they walk - You have placed them on the Path.
        In Your Mercy, You attach them to the Naam; they meditate forever
        on the Lord, Har, Har. Those whom You cause to listen to Your
        sermon, find peace in the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate. Says
        Nanak, O my True Lord and Master, you make us walk according to
        Your Will.  || 15 ||   This song of praise is the Shabad, the
        most beautiful Word of God. This beauteous Shabad is the everlasting
        song of praise, spoken by the True Guru. This is enshrined in
        the minds of those who are so pre-destined by the Lord. Some wander
        around, babbling on and on, but none obtain Him by babbling. Says
        Nanak, the Shabad, this song of praise, has been spoken by the
        True Guru.  || 16 ||   Those humble beings who meditate on the
        Lord become pure. Meditating on the Lord, they become pure; as
        Gurmukh, they meditate on Him. They are pure, along with their
        mothers, fathers, family and friends; all their companions are
        pure as well. Pure are those who speak, and pure are those who
        listen; those who enshrine it within their minds are pure. Says
        Nanak, pure and holy are those who, as Gurmukh, meditate on the
        Lord, Har, Har.  || 17 ||   By religious rituals, intuitive poise
        is not found; without intuitive poise, skepticism does not depart.
        Skepticism does not depart by contrived actions; everybody is
        tired of performing these rituals. The soul is polluted by skepticism;
        how can it be cleansed? Wash your mind by attaching it to the
        Shabad, and keep your consciousness focused on the Lord. Says
        Nanak, by Guru's Grace, intuitive poise is produced, and
        this skepticism is dispelled.  || 18 ||   Inwardly polluted, and
        outwardly pure. Those who are outwardly pure and yet polluted
        within, lose their lives in the gamble. They contract this terrible
        disease of desire, and in their minds, they forget about dying.
        In the Vedas, the ultimate objective is the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord; but they do not hear this, and they wander around like
        demons. Says Nanak, those who forsake Truth and cling to falsehood,
        lose their lives in the gamble.  || 19 ||   Inwardly pure, and
        outwardly pure. Those who are outwardly pure and also pure within,
        through the Guru, perform good deeds. Not even an iota of falsehood
        touches them; their hopes are absorbed in the Truth. Those who
        earn the jewel of this human life, are the most excellent of merchants.
        Says Nanak, those whose minds are pure, abide with the Guru forever.
        || 20 ||   If a Sikh turns to the Guru with sincere faith, as
        sunmukh - if a Sikh turns to the Guru with sincere faith,
        as sunmukh, his soul abides with the Guru. Within his heart, he
        meditates on the lotus feet of the Guru; deep within his soul,
        he contemplates Him. </p>
