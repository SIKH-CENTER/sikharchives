      <p> Some are hungry and some are satisfied and satiated, but all lean
        on Your Support.  || 3 ||   The True Lord Himself is True, True,
        True. He is woven into the essence of His devotees, through and
        through. He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is revealed. He
        Himself spreads Himself out.  || 4 ||   Forever, forever and ever,
        He shall always exist. He is lofty, inaccessible, unfathomable
        and infinite. He fills the empty, and empties out the filled;
        such are the plays and dramas of my Lord and Master.  || 5 ||
        With my mouth, I praise my True Lord King. With my eyes, I behold
        the inaccessible and unfathomable Lord. Listening, listening with
        my ears, my mind and body are rejuvenated; my Lord and Master
        saves all.  || 6 ||   He created the creation, and gazes upon
        what He has created. All beings and creatures meditate on Him.
        He Himself knows His creative power; He blesses with His Glance
        of Grace.  || 7 ||   Where the Saints gather together and sit,
        God dwells close at hand. They abide in bliss and joy, beholding
        the Lord's wondrous play. They sing the Glories of the
        Lord, and the unstruck sound current of His Bani; O Nanak, His
        slaves remain conscious of Him.  || 8 ||   Coming and going is
        all Your wondrous play. Creating the Creation, You gaze upon Your
        infinite play. Creating the Creation, You Yourself cherish and
        nurture it.  || 9 ||   Listening, listening to Your Glory, I live.
        Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to You. With my palms pressed
        together, I meditate in remembrance on You, day and night, O my
        inaccessible, infinite Lord and Master.  || 10 ||   Other than
        You, who else should I praise? I meditate on the One and Only
        Lord within my mind. Realizing the Hukam of Your Will, Your humble
        servants are enraptured; this is the achievement of Your devotees.
        || 11 ||   Following the Guru's Teachings, I meditate
        on the True Lord within my mind. Following the Guru's Teachings,
        I am immersed in the Lord's Love. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, all bonds are broken, and this doubt and emotional
        attachment are burnt away.  || 12 ||   Wherever He keeps me, is
        my place of rest. Whatever naturally happens, I accept that as
        good. Hatred is gone - I have no hatred at all; I see the
        One Lord in all.  || 13 ||   Fear has been removed, and darkness
        has been dispelled. The all-powerful, primal, detached Lord God
        has been revealed. Forsaking self-conceit, I have entered His
        Sanctuary, and I work for Him.  || 14 ||   Rare are those few,
        very blessed people, who come into the world, and meditate on
        their Lord and Master, twenty-four hours a day. Associating with
        such humble people, all are saved, and their families are saved
        as well.  || 15 ||   This is the blessing which I have received
        from my Lord and Master. Twenty-four hours a day, with my palms
        pressed together, I meditate on Him. I chant the Naam, and through
        the Naam, I intuitively merge into the Lord; O Nanak, may I be
        blessed with the Naam, and ever repeat it.  || 16 || 1 || 6 ||
        MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  Do not be fooled by appearances, you fool.
        This is a false attachment to the expanse of an illusion. No one
        can remain in this world; only the One Lord is permanent and unchanging.
        || 1 ||   Seek the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru. He shall eradicate
        all emotional attachment, sorrow and doubt. He shall administer
        the medicine, the Mantra of the One Name. <br>

      <p> Sing the True Name within your heart.  || 2 ||   So many gods
        yearn for the Naam, the Name of the Lord. All the devotees serve
        Him. He is the Master of the masterless, the Destroyer of the
        pains of the poor. His Name is obtained from the Perfect Guru.
        || 3 ||   I cannot conceive of any other door. One who wanders
        through the three worlds, understands nothing. The True Guru is
        the banker, with the treasure of the Naam. This jewel is obtained
        from Him.  || 4 ||   The dust of His feet purifies. Even the angelic
        beings and gods cannot obtain it, O friend. The True Guru is the
        True Primal Being, the Transcendent Lord God; meeting with Him,
        one is carried across to the other side.  || 5 ||   O my beloved
        mind, if you wish for the 'tree of life'; if you wish
        for Kaamadhayna, the wish-fulfilling cow to adorn your court;
        if you wish to be satisfied and contented, then serve the Perfect
        Guru, and practice the Naam, the source of nectar.  || 6 ||  
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the five thieves
        of desire are conquered. In the Fear of the Supreme Lord God,
        you shall become immaculate and pure. When one meets the Perfect
        Guru, the Philosopher's Stone, His touch reveals the Lord,
        the Philosopher's Stone.  || 7 ||   Myriads of heavens
        do not equal the Lord's Name. The spiritually wise forsake
        mere liberation. The One Universal Creator Lord is found through
        the True Guru. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision
        of the Guru's Darshan.  || 8 ||   No one knows how to serve
        the Guru. The Guru is the unfathomable, Supreme Lord God. He alone
        is the Guru's servant, whom the Guru Himself links to His
        service, and upon whose forehead such blessed destiny is inscribed.
        || 9 ||   Even the Vedas do not know the Guru's Glory.
        They narrate only a tiny bit of what is heard. The True Guru is
        the Supreme Lord God, the Incomparable One; meditating in remembrance
        on Him, the mind is cooled and soothed.  || 10 ||   Hearing of
        Him, the mind comes to life. When He dwells within the heart,
        one becomes peaceful and cool. Chanting the Guru's Name
        with the mouth, one obtains glory, and does not have to walk on
        the Path of Death.  || 11 ||   I have entered the Sanctuary of
        the Saints, and placed before them my soul, my breath of life
        and wealth. I know nothing about service and awareness; please
        take pity upon this worm.  || 12 ||   I am unworthy; please merge
        me into Yourself. Please bless me with Your Grace, and link me
        to Your service. I wave the fan, and grind the corn for the Saints;
        washing their feet, I find peace.  || 13 ||   After wandering
        around at so many doors, I have come to Yours, O Lord. By Your
        Grace, I have entered Your Sanctuary. Forever and ever, keep me
        in the Company of the Saints; please bless me with this Gift of
        Your Name.  || 14 ||   My World-Lord has become merciful, and
        I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Perfect
        True Guru. I have found eternal peace, poise and bliss; Nanak
        is the slave of Your slaves.  || 15 || 2 || 7 || <br>

      <p> All creation meditates in remembrance.  || 1 ||   All the continents,
        islands and worlds meditate in remembrance. The nether worlds
        and spheres meditate in remembrance on that True Lord. The sources
        of creation and speech meditate in remembrance; all the Lord's
        humble servants meditate in remembrance.  || 2 ||   Brahma, Vishnu
        and Shiva meditate in remembrance. The thirty-three million gods
        meditate in remembrance. The titans and demons all meditate in
        remembrance; Your Praises are uncountable - they cannot
        be counted.  || 3 ||   All the beasts, birds and demons meditate
        in remembrance. The forests, mountains and hermits meditate in
        remembrance. All the vines and branches meditate in remembrance;
        O my Lord and Master, You are permeating and pervading all minds.
        || 4 ||   All beings, both subtle and gross, meditate in remembrance.
        The Siddhas and seekers meditate in remembrance on the Lord's
        Mantra. Both the visible and the invisible meditate in remembrance
        on my God; God is the Master of all worlds.  || 5 ||   Men and
        women, throughout the four stages of life, meditate in remembrance
        on You. All social classes and souls of all races meditate in
        remembrance on You. All the virtuous, clever and wise people meditate
        in remembrance; night and day meditate in remembrance.  || 6 ||
        Hours, minutes and seconds meditate in remembrance. Death and
        life, and thoughts of purification, meditate in remembrance. The
        Shaastras, with their lucky signs and joinings, meditate in remembrance;
        the invisible cannot be seen, even for an instant.  || 7 ||  
        The Lord and Master is the Doer, the Cause of causes. He is the
        Inner-knower, the Searcher of all hearts. That person, whom You
        bless with Your Grace, and link to Your devotional service, wins
        this invaluable human life.  || 8 ||   He, within whose mind God
        dwells, has perfect karma, and chants the Chant of the Guru. One
        who realizes God pervading deep within all, does not wander crying
        in reincarnation again.  || 9 ||   Pain, sorrow and doubt run
        away from that one, within whose mind the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad abides. Intuitive peace, poise and bliss come from the
        sublime essence of the Naam; the unstruck sound current of the
        Guru's Bani intuitively vibrates and resounds.  || 10 ||
        He alone is wealthy, who meditates on God. He alone is honorable,
        who joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. That person,
        within whose mind the Supreme Lord God abides, has perfect karma,
        and becomes famous.  || 11 ||   The Lord and Master is pervading
        the water, land and sky. There is no other said to be so. The
        ointment of the Guru's spiritual wisdom has eradicated
        all doubts; except the One Lord, I do not see any other at all.
        || 12 ||   The Lord's Court is the highest of the high.
        His limit and extent cannot be described. The Lord and Master
        is profoundly deep, unfathomable and unweighable; how can He be
        measured?  || 13 ||   You are the Creator; all is created by You.
        Without You, there is no other at all. You alone, God, are in
        the beginning, the middle and the end. You are the root of the
        entire expanse.  || 14 ||   The Messenger of Death does not even
        approach that person who sings the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. All desires
        are fulfilled, for one who listens with his ears to the Praises
        of God.  || 15 ||   You belong to all, and all belong to You,
        O my true, deep and profound Lord and Master. <br>

      <p> Says Nanak, those humble beings are exalted, who are pleasing
        to Your Mind, O my Lord and Master.  || 16 || 1 || 8 ||   MARU,
        FIFTH MEHL:  God is the almighty Giver of all peace and joy.
        Be merciful to me, that I may meditate in remembrance on Your
        Name. The Lord is the Great Giver; all beings and creatures are
        beggars; His humble servants yearn to beg from Him.  || 1 || 
        I beg for the dust of the feet of the humble, that I may be blessed
        with the supreme status, and the filth of countless lifetimes
        may be erased. The chronic diseases are cured by the medicine
        of the Lord's Name; I beg to be imbued with the Immaculate
        Lord.  || 2 ||   With my ears, I listen to the Pure Praises of
        my Lord and Master. With the Support of the One Lord, I have abandoned
        corruption, sexuality and desire. I humbly bow and fall at the
        feet of Your slaves; I do not hesitate to do good deeds.  || 3
        ||   O Lord, with my tongue I sing Your Glorious Praises. The
        sins which I have committed are erased. Meditating, meditating
        in remembrance on my Lord and Master, my mind lives; I am rid
        of the five oppressive demons.  || 4 ||   Meditating on Your lotus
        feet, I have come aboard Your boat. Joining the Society of the
        Saints, I cross over the world-ocean. My flower-offering and worship
        is to realize that the Lord is dwelling alike in all; I shall
        not be reincarnated naked again.  || 5 ||   Please make me the
        slave of Your slaves, O Lord of the world. You are the treasure
        of Grace, merciful to the meek. Meet with your companion and helper,
        the Perfect Transcendent Lord God; you shall never be separated
        from Him again.  || 6 ||   I dedicate my mind and body, and place
        them in offering before the Lord. Asleep for countless lifetimes,
        I have awakened. He, to whom I belong, is my cherisher and nurturer.
        I have killed and discarded my murderous self-conceit.  || 7 ||
        The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is pervading the water
        and the land. The undeceivable Lord and Master is permeating each
        and every heart. The Perfect Guru has demolished the wall of doubt,
        and now I see the One Lord pervading everywhere.  || 8 ||   Wherever
        I look, there I see God, the ocean of peace. The Lord's
        treasure is never exhausted; He is the storehouse of jewels. He
        cannot be seized; He is inaccessible, and His limits cannot be
        found. He is realized when the Lord bestows His Grace.  || 9 ||
        My heart is cooled, and my mind and body are calmed and soothed.
        The craving for birth and death is quenched. Grasping hold of
        my hand, He has lifted me up and out; He has blessed me with His
        Ambrosial Glance of Grace.  || 10 ||   The One and Only Lord is
        permeating and pervading everywhere. There is none other than
        Him at all. God permeates the beginning, the middle and the end;
        He has subdued my desires and doubts.  || 11 ||   The Guru is
        the Transcendent Lord, the Guru is the Lord of the Universe. The
        Guru is the Creator, the Guru is forever forgiving. Meditating,
        chanting the Guru's Chant, I have obtained the fruits and
        rewards; in the Company of the Saints, I have been blessed with
        the lamp of spiritual wisdom.  || 12 ||   Whatever I see, is my
        Lord and Master God. Whatever I hear, is the Bani of God's
        Word. Whatever I do, You make me do; You are the Sanctuary, the
        help and support of the Saints, Your children.  || 13 ||   The
        beggar begs, and worships You in adoration. You are the Purifier
        of the sinners, O Perfectly Holy Lord God. Please bless me with
        this one gift, O treasure of all bliss and virtue; I do not ask
        for anything else.  || 14 || <br>

      <p> God is the Creator of the body-vessel. In the Society of the Saints,
        the dye is produced. Through the Word of the Lord's Bani,
        one's reputation becomes immaculate, and the mind is colored
        by the dye of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 15 ||   The
        sixteen powers, absolute perfection and fruitful rewards are obtained,
        when the Lord and Master of infinite power is revealed. The Lord's
        Name is Nanak's bliss, play and peace; he drinks in the
        Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord.  || 16 || 2 || 9 || <br>

        Truth of the True Guru.  || 8 ||   You issue Your Command for
        this amazing thing, death. You create all beings and creatures,
        and absorb them back into Yourself. You gaze in delight upon the
        one arena of the world, and enjoy all the pleasures.  || 9 ||
        Great is the Lord and Master, and Great is His Name. He is the
        Great Giver; Great is His place. He is inaccessible and unfathomable,
        infinite and unweighable. He cannot be measureed.  || 10 ||  
        No one else knows His value. Only You Yourself, O Immaculate Lord,
        are equal to Yourself. You Yourself are the spiritual teacher,
        You Yourself are the One who meditates. You Yourself are the great
        and immense Being of Truth.  || 11 ||   For so many days, You
        were absorbed in silent absorption. For so many days, there was
        only pitch darkness, and then the Creator revealed Himself.  ||
        12 ||   You Yourself are called the God of Supreme Power. <br>

      <p> You Yourself are the hero, exerting Your regal power. You Yourself
        spread peace within; You are cool and icy calm.  || 13 ||   One
        whom You bless and make Gurmukh - the Naam abides within
        him, and the unstruck sound current vibrates for him. He is peaceful,
        and he is the master of all; the Messenger of Death does not even
        approach him.  || 14 ||   His value cannot be described on paper.
        Says Nanak, the Lord of the world is infinite. In the beginning,
        in the middle and in the end, God exists. Judgement is in His
        Hands alone.  || 15 ||   No one is equal to Him. No one can stand
        up against Him by any means. Nanak's God is Himself all-in-all.
        He creates and stages and watches His wondrous plays.  || 16 ||
        1 || 10 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Supreme Lord God is imperishable,
        the Transcendent Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
        He is the Slayer of demons, our Supreme Lord and Master. The Supreme
        Rishi, the Master of the sensory organs, the uplifter of mountains,
        the joyful Lord playing His enticing flute.  || 1 ||   The Enticer
        of Hearts, the Lord of wealth, Krishna, the Enemy of ego. The
        Lord of the Universe, the Dear Lord, the Destroyer of demons.
        The Life of the World, our eternal and ever-stable Lord and Master
        dwells within each and every heart, and is always with us.  ||
        2 ||   The Support of the Earth, the man-lion, the Supreme Lord
        God. The Protector who tears apart demons with His teeth, the
        Upholder of the earth. O Creator, You assumed the form of the
        pygmy to humble the demons; You are the Lord God of all.  || 3
        ||   You are the Great Raam Chand, who has no form or feature.
        Adorned with flowers, holding the chakra in Your hand, Your form
        is incomparably beautiful. You have thousands of eyes, and thousands
        of forms. You alone are the Giver, and all are beggars of You.
        || 4 ||   You are the Lover of Your devotees, the Master of the
        masterless. The Lord and Master of the milk-maids, You are the
        companion of all. O Lord, Immacuate Great Giver, I cannot describe
        even an iota of Your Glorious Virtues.  || 5 ||   Liberator, Enticing
        Lord, Lord of Lakshmi, Supreme Lord God. Savior of Dropadi's
        honor. Lord of Maya, miracle-worker, absorbed in delightful play,
        unattached.  || 6 ||   The Blessed Vision of His Darshan is fruitful
        and rewarding; He is not born, He is self-existent. His form is
        undying; it is never destroyed. O imperishable, eternal, unfathomable
        Lord, everything is attached to You.  || 7 ||   The Lover of greatness,
        who dwells in heaven. By the Pleasure of His Will, He took incarnation
        as the great fish and the tortoise. The Lord of beauteous hair,
        the Worker of miraculous deeds, whatever He wishes, comes to pass.
        || 8 ||   He is beyond need of any sustenance, free of hate and
        all-pervading. He has staged His play; He is called the four-armed
        Lord. He assumed the beautiful form of the blue-skinned Krishna;
        hearing His flute, all are fascinated and enticed.  || 9 ||  
        He is adorned with garlands of flowers, with lotus eyes. His ear-rings,
        crown and flute are so beautiful. He carries the conch, the chakra
        and the war club; He is the Great Charioteer, who stays with His
        Saints.  || 10 ||   The Lord of yellow robes, the Master of the
        three worlds. The Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the world;
        with my mouth, I chant His Name. The Archer who draws the bow,
        the Beloved Lord God; I cannot count all His limbs.  || 11 ||
        He is said to be free of anguish, and absolutely immaculate.
        The Lord of prosperity, pervading the water, the land and the
        sky. <br>

      <p> He is near this world and the nether regions of the underworld;
        His Place is permanent, ever-stable and imperishable.  || 12 ||
        The Purifier of sinners, the Destroyer of pain and fear. The
        Eliminator of egotism, the Eradicator of coming and going. He
        is pleased with devotional worship, and merciful to the meek;
        He cannot be appeased by any other qualities.  || 13 ||   The
        Formless Lord is undeceivable and unchanging. He is the Embodiment
        of Light; through Him, the whole world blossoms forth. He alone
        unites with Him, whom He unites with Himself. No one can attain
        the Lord by himself.  || 14 ||   He Himself is the milk-maid,
        and He Himself is Krishna. He Himself grazes the cows in the forest.
        You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy. Not even a particle
        of filth attaches to You.  || 15 ||   Which of Your Glorious Virtues
        can I chant with my one tongue? Even the thousand-headed serpent
        does not know Your limit. One may chant new names for You day
        and night, but even so, O God, no one can describe even one of
        Your Glorious Virtues.  || 16 ||   I have grasped the Support,
        and entered the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Father of the world.
        The Messenger of Death is terrifying and horrendous, and sea of
        Maya is impassable. Please be merciful, Lord, and save me, if
        it is Your Will; please lead me to join with the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy.  || 17 ||   All that is seen is an illusion.
        I beg for this one gift, for the dust of the feet of the Saints,
        O Lord of the Universe. Applying it to my forehead, I obtain the
        supreme status; he alone obtains it, unto whom You give it.  ||
        18 ||   Those, unto whom the Lord, the Giver of peace, grants
        His Mercy, grasp the feet of the Holy, and weave them into their
        hearts. They obtain all the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord; the unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds
        within their minds.  || 19 ||   With my tongue I chant the Names
        given to You. 'Sat Naam' is Your perfect, primal Name.
        Says Nanak, Your devotees have entered Your Sanctuary. Please
        bestow the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; their minds are filled
        with love for You.  || 20 ||   You alone know Your state and extent.
        You Yourself speak, and You Yourself describe it. Please make
        Nanak the slave of Your slaves, O Lord; as it pleases Your Will,
        please keep him with Your slaves.  || 21 || 2 || 11 ||   MARU,
        FIFTH MEHL:  O slave of the inaccessible Lord God Allah, forsake
        thoughts of worldly entanglements. Become the dust of the feet
        of the humble fakeers, and consider yourself a traveller on this
        journey. O saintly dervish, you shall be approved in the Court
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Let Truth be your prayer, and faith your
        prayer-mat. Subdue your desires, and overcome your hopes. Let
        your body be the mosque, and your mind the priest. Let true purity
        be God's Word for you.  || 2 ||   Let your practice be
        to live the spiritual life. Let your spiritual cleansing be to
        renounce the world and seek God. Let control of the mind be your
        spiritual wisdom, O holy man; meeting with God, you shall never
        die again.  || 3 ||   Practice within your heart the teachings
        of the Koran and the Bible; restrain the ten sensory organs from
        straying into evil. Tie up the five demons of desire with faith,
        charity and contentment, and you shall be acceptable.  || 4 ||
        Let compassion be your Mecca, and the dust of the feet of the
        holy your fast. Let Paradise be your practice of the Prophet's
        Word. God is the beauty, the light and the fragrance. Meditation
        on Allah is the secluded meditation chamber.  || 5 || <br>

      <p> He alone is a Qazi, who practices the Truth. He alone is a Haji,
        a pilgrim to Mecca, who purifies his heart. He alone is a Mullah,
        who banishes evil; he alone is a saintly dervish, who takes the
        Support of the Lord's Praise.  || 6 ||   Always, at every
        moment, remember God, the Creator within your heart. Let your
        meditation beads be the subjugation of the ten senses. Let good
        conduct and self-restraint be your circumcision.  || 7 ||   You
        must know in your heart that everything is temporary. Family,
        household and siblings are all entanglements. Kings, rulers and
        nobles are mortal and transitory; only God's Gate is the
        permanent place.  || 8 ||   First, is the Lord's Praise;
        second, contentment; third, humility, and fourth, giving to charities.
        Fifth is to hold one's desires in restraint. These are
        the five most sublime daily prayers.  || 9 ||   Let your daily
        worship be the knowledge that God is everywhere. Let renunciation
        of evil actions be the water-jug you carry. Let realization of
        the One Lord God be your call to prayer; be a good child of God
        - let this be your trumpet.  || 10 ||   Let what is earned
        righteously be your blessed food. Wash away pollution with the
        river of your heart. One who realizes the Prophet attains heaven.
        Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, does not cast him into hell.
        || 11 ||   Let good deeds be your body, and faith your bride.
        Play and enjoy the Lord's love and delight. Purify what
        is impure, and let the Lord's Presence be your religious
        tradition. Let your total awareness be the turban on your head.
        || 12 ||   To be Muslim is to be kind-hearted, and wash away
        pollution from within the heart. He does not even approach worldly
        pleasures; he is pure, like flowers, silk, ghee and the deer-skin.
        || 13 ||   One who is blessed with the mercy and compassion of
        the Merciful Lord, is the manliest man among men. He alone is
        a Shaykh, a preacher, a Haji, and he alone is God's slave,
        who is blessed with God's Grace.  || 14 ||   The Creator
        Lord has Creative Power; the Merciful Lord has Mercy. The Praises
        and the Love of the Merciful Lord are unfathomable. Realize the
        True Hukam, the Command of the Lord, O Nanak; you shall be released
        from bondage, and carried across.  || 15 || 3 || 12 ||   MARU,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Abode of the Supreme Lord God is above all.
        He Himself establishes, establishes and creates. Holding tight
        to the Sanctuary of God, peace is found, and one is not afflicted
        by the fear of Maya.  || 1 ||   He saved you from the fire of
        the womb, and did not destroy you, when you were an egg in your
        mother's ovary. Blessing you with meditative remembrance
        upon Himself, He nurtured you and cherished you; He is the Master
        of all hearts.  || 2 ||   I have come to the Sanctuary of His
        lotus feet. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing
        the Praises of the Lord. I have erased all the pains of birth
        and death; meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, I have no fear of
        death.  || 3 ||   God is all-powerful, indescribable, unfathomable
        and divine. All beings and creatures serve Him. In so many ways,
        He cherishes those born from eggs, from the womb, from sweat and
        from the earth.  || 4 ||   He alone obtains this wealth, who savors
        and enjoys, deep within his mind, the Name of the Lord. Grasping
        hold of his arm, God lifts him up and pulls him out of the deep,
        dark pit. <br>

      <p> Such a devotee of the Lord is very rare.  || 5 ||   God exists
        in the beginning, in the middle and in the end. Whatever the Creator
        Lord Himself does, comes to pass. Doubt and fear are erased, in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and then one is not
        afflicted by deadly pain.  || 6 ||   I sing the most Sublime Bani,
        the Word of the Lord of the Universe. I beg for the dust of the
        feet of the Saadh Sangat. Eradicating desire, I have become free
        of desire; I have burnt away all my sins.  || 7 ||   This is the
        unique way of the Saints; they behold the Supreme Lord God with
        them. With each and every breath, they worship and adore the Lord,
        Har, Har. How could anyone be too lazy to meditate on Him?  ||
        8 ||   Wherever I look, there I see the Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts. I never forget God, my Lord and Master, even for an
        instant. Your slaves live by meditating, meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord; You are permeating the woods, the water and the land.
        || 9 ||   Even the hot wind does not touch one who remains awake
        in meditative remembrance, night and day. He delights and enjoys
        meditative remembrance on the Lord; he has no attachment to Maya.
        || 10 ||   Disease, sorrow and pain do not affect him; he sings
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy. Please bless me with Your Name, O my Beloved
        Lord God; please listen to my prayer, O Creator.  || 11 ||   Your
        Name is a jewel, O my Beloved Lord. Your slaves are imbued with
        Your Infinite Love. Those who are imbued with Your Love, become
        like You; it is so rare that they are found.  || 12 ||   My mind
        longs for the dust of the feet of those who never forget the Lord.
        Associating with them, I obtain the supreme status; the Lord,
        my Companion, is always with me.  || 13 ||   He alone is my beloved
        friend and companion, who implants the Name of the One Lord within,
        and eradicates evil-mindedness. Immaculate are the teachings of
        that humble servant of the Lord, who casts out sexual desire,
        anger and egotism.  || 14 ||   Other than You, O Lord, no one
        is mine. The Guru has led me to grasp the feet of God. I am a
        sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru, who has destroyed the illusion
        of duality.  || 15 ||   With each and every breath, I never forget
        God. Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.
        O Nanak, the Saints are imbued with Your Love; You are the great
        and all-powerful Lord.  || 16 || 4 || 13 || <br>

        and the eighteen miraculous spiritual powers, are found in the
        treasure of the Naam, which brings celestial peace and poise,
        and the nine treasures. If you yearn in your mind for all joys,
        then join the Saadh Sangat, and dwell upon your Lord and Master.
        || 4 ||   The Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas proclaim
        that the mortal must be victorious in this priceless human life.
        Forsaking sexual desire, anger and slander, sing of the Lord with
        your tongue, O Nanak.  || 5 ||   He has no form or shape, no ancestry
        or social class. The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading day and
        night. Whoever meditates on Him is very fortunate; he is not consigned
        to reincarnation again.  || 6 ||   One who forgets the Primal
        Lord, the Architect of karma, wanders around burning, and remains
        tormented. No one can save such an ungrateful person; he is thrown
        into the most horrible hell.  || 7 ||   He blessed you with your
        soul, the breath of life, your body and wealth; He preserved and
        nurtured you in your mother's womb. Forsaking His Love,
        you are imbued with another; you shall never achieve your goals
        like this.  || 8 ||   Please shower me with Your Merciful Grace,
        O my Lord and Master. You dwell in each and every heart, and are
        near everyone. Nothing is in my hands; he alone knows, whom You
        inspire to know.  || 9 ||   One who has such pre-ordained destiny

        Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary forever; there is no other equal
        to You.  || 10 ||   In His Will, He made all pain and pleasure.
        How rare are those who remember the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of
        the Lord. His value cannot be described. He is prevailing everywhere.
        || 11 ||   He is the devotee; He is the Great Giver. He is the
        Perfect Primal Lord, the Architect of karma. He is your help and
        support, since infancy; He fulfills your mind's desires.
        || 12 ||   Death, pain and pleasure are ordained by the Lord.
        They do not increase or decrease by anyone's efforts. That
        alone happens, which is pleasing to the Creator; speaking of himself,
        the mortal ruins himself.  || 13 ||   He lifts us up and pulls
        us out of the deep dark pit; He unites with Himself, those who
        were separated for so many incarnations. Showering them with His
        Mercy, He protects them with His own hands. Meeting with the Holy
        Saints, they meditate on the Lord of the Universe.  || 14 || 
        Your worth cannot be described. Wondrous is Your form, and Your
        glorious greatness. Your humble servant begs for the gift of devotional

      <p> <font color="#000000">SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  If virtue is sold when
        there is no buyer, then it is sold very cheap. But if one meets
        a buyer of virtue, then virtue sells for hundreds of thousands. <br>

      <p> Meeting with a virtuous person, virtue is obtained, and one is
        immersed in the True Guru. Priceless virtues are not obtained
        for any price; they cannot be purchased in a store. O Nanak, their
        weight is full and perfect; it never decreases at all.  || 1 ||
        FOURTH MEHL:  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they wander
        around, continually coming and going in reincarnation. Some are
        in bondage, and some are set free; some are happy in the Love
        of the Lord. O Nanak, believe in the True Lord, and practice Truth,
        through the lifestyle of Truth.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  From the Guru,
        I have obtained the supremely powerful sword of spiritual wisdom.
        I have cut down the fortress of duality and doubt, attachment,
        greed and egotism. The Name of the Lord abides within my mind;
        I contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Through Truth,
        self-discipline and sublime understanding, the Lord has become
        very dear to me. Truly, truly, the True Creator Lord is all-pervading.
        || 1 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Among the ragas, Kaydaaraa Raga
        is known as good, O Siblings of Destiny, if through it, one comes
        to love the Word of the Shabad, and if one remains in the Soceity
        of the Saints, and enshrines love for the True Lord. Such a person
        washes away the pollution from within, and saves his generations
        as well. He gathes in the capital of virtue, and destroys and
        drives out unvirtuous sins. O Nanak, he alone is known as united,
        who does not forsake his Guru, and who does not love duality.
        || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Gazing upon the world-ocean, I am afraid
        of death; but if I live in the Fear of You, God, then I am not
        afraid. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I am content;
        O Nanak, I blossom forth in the Name.  || 2 ||   FOURTH MEHL:
        I get on board the boat and set out, but the ocean is churning
        with waves. The boat of Truth encounters no obstruction, if the
        Guru gives encouragement. He takes us across to the door on the
        other side, as the Guru keeps watch. O Nanak, if I am blessed
        with His Grace, I shall go to His Court with honor.  || 3 || 
        PAUREE:  Enjoy your kingdom of bliss; as Gurmukh, practice Truth.
        Sitting upon the throne of Truth, the Lord administers justice;
        He unites us in Union with the Society of the Saints. Meditating
        on the Lord, through the True Teachings, we become just like the
        Lord. If the Lord, the Giver of peace, abides in the mind, in
        this world, then in the end, He becomes our help and support.
        Love for the Lord wells up, when the Guru imparts understanding.
        || 2 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Confused and deluded, I wander
        around, but no one shows me the way. I go and ask the clever people,
        if there is there anyone who can rid me of my pain. If the True
        Guru abides within my mind, then I see the Lord, my best friend,
        there. O Nanak, my mind is satisfied and fulfilled, contemplating
        the Praises of the True Name.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  He Himself
        is the Doer, and He is the deed; He Himself issues the Command.
        He Himself forgives some, and He Himself does the deed. O Nanak,
        receiving the Divine Light from the Guru, suffering and corruption
        are burnt away, through the Name.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Don't
        be fooled by gazing at the riches of Maya, you foolish self-willed
        manmukh. It shall not go along with you when you must depart;
        all the wealth you see is false. The blind and ignorant do not
        understand, that the sword of death is hanging over their heads. </p>
