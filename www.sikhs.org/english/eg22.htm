      <p> As the Lord attaches someone, so is he attached. He alone is the
        Lord's servant, O Nanak, who is so blessed.  || 8 || 6 ||
        GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Without meditating in remembrance on the
        Lord, one's life is like that of a snake. This is how the
        faithless cynic lives, forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   One who lives in meditative remembrance, even for an
        instant, lives for hundreds of thousands and millions of days,
        and becomes stable forever.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without meditating
        in remembrance on the Lord, one's actions and works are cursed.
        Like the crow's beak, he dwells in manure.  || 2 ||   Without
        meditating in remembrance on the Lord, one acts like a dog. The
        faithless cynic is nameless, like the prostitute's son. 
        || 3 ||   Without meditating in remembrance on the Lord, one is
        like a horned ram. The faithless cynic barks out his lies, and
        his face is blackened.  || 4 ||   Without meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord, one is like a donkey. The faithless cynic wanders
        around in polluted places.  || 5 ||   Without meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord, one is like a mad dog. The greedy, faithless cynic
        falls into entanglements.  || 6 ||   Without meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord, he murders his own soul. The faithless cynic is wretched,
        without family or social standing.  || 7 ||   When the Lord becomes
        merciful, one joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Says
        Nanak, the Guru has saved the world.  || 8 || 7 ||   GAUREE, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  Through the Guru's Word, I have attained the
        supreme status. The Perfect Guru has preserved my honor.  || 1
        ||   Through the Guru's Word, I meditate on the Name. By
        Guru's Grace, I have obtained a place of rest.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   I listen to the Guru's Word, and chant it with
        my tongue. By Guru's Grace, my speech is like nectar.  ||
        2 ||   Through the Guru's Word, my selfishness and conceit
        have been removed. Through the Guru's kindness, I have obtained
        glorious greatness.  || 3 ||   Through the Guru's Word, my
        doubts have been removed. Through the Guru's Word, I see
        God everywhere.  || 4 ||   Through the Guru's Word, I practice
        Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success. In the Company
        of the Guru, all the people of the world are saved.  || 5 || 
        Through the Guru's Word, my affairs are resolved. Through
        the Guru's Word, I have obtained the nine treasures.  ||
        6 ||   Whoever places his hopes in my Guru, has the noose of death
        cut away.  || 7 ||   Through the Guru's Word, my good karma
        has been awakened. O Nanak, meeting with the Guru, I have found
        the Supreme Lord God.  || 8 || 8 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I
        remember the Guru with each and every breath. The Guru is my breath
        of life, the True Guru is my wealth.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Beholding
        the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I live. I wash
        the Guru's Feet, and drink in this water.  || 1 ||   I take
        my daily bath in the dust of the Guru's Feet. The egotistical
        filth of countless incarnations is washed off.  || 2 ||   I wave
        the fan over the Guru. Giving me His Hand, He has saved me from
        the great fire.  || 3 ||   I carry water for the Guru's household;
        from the Guru, I have learned the Way of the One Lord.  || 4 ||
        I grind the corn for the Guru's household. </p>

      </p>
      <p> By His Grace, all my enemies have become friends.  || 5 ||   The
        Guru who gave me my soul, has Himself purchased me, and made me
        His slave.  || 6 ||   He Himself has blessed me with His Love.
        Forever and ever, I humbly bow to the Guru.  || 7 ||   My troubles,
        conflicts, fears, doubts and pains have been dispelled; says Nanak,
        my Guru is All-powerful.  || 8 || 9 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Meet me, O my Lord of the Universe. Please bless me with Your
        Name. Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, cursed, cursed is
        love and intimacy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without the Naam, one
        who dresses and eats well is like a dog, who falls in and eats
        impure foods.  || 1 ||   Without the Naam, all occupations are
        useless, like decorations on a dead body.  || 2 ||   One who forgets
        the Naam and indulges in pleasures, shall find no peace, even
        in dreams; his body shall become diseased.  || 3 ||   One who
        renounces the Naam and engages in other occupations, shall see
        all of his false pretenses fall away.  || 4 ||   One whose mind
        does not embrace love for the Naam shall go to hell, even though
        he may perform millions of ceremonial rituals.  || 5 ||   One
        whose mind does not contemplate the Name of the Lord is bound
        like a thief, in the City of Death.  || 6 ||   Hundreds of thousands
        of ostentatious shows and great expanses  -  without the Naam,
        all these displays are false.  || 7 ||   That humble being repeats
        the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, whom the Lord blesses with His
        Mercy.  || 8 || 10 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  My mind longs for
        that Friend, who shall stand by me in the beginning, in the middle
        and in the end.  || 1 ||   The Lord's Love goes with us forever.
        The Perfect and Merciful Lord cherishes all.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   He shall never perish, and He shall never abandon me. Wherever
        I look, there I see Him pervading and permeating.  || 2 ||   He
        is Beautiful, All-knowing, the most Clever, the Giver of life.
        God is my Brother, Son, Father and Mother.  || 3 ||   He is the
        Support of the breath of life; He is my Wealth. Abiding within
        my heart, He inspires me to enshrine love for Him.  || 4 ||  
        The Lord of the World has cut away the noose of Maya. He has made
        me His own, blessing me with His Glance of Grace.  || 5 ||   Remembering,
        remembering Him in meditation, all diseases are healed. Meditating
        on His Feet, all comforts are enjoyed.  || 6 ||   The Perfect
        Primal Lord is Ever-fresh and Ever-young. The Lord is with me,
        inwardly and outwardly, as my Protector.  || 7 ||   Says Nanak,
        that devotee who realizes the state of the Lord, Har, Har, is
        blessed with the treasure of the Naam.  || 8 || 11 || </p>

      </center>
      <p> Countless are those who wander around searching for You, but they
        do not find Your limits. They alone are Your devotees, who are
        blessed by Your Grace.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, I am a sacrifice
        to You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Continually hearing of the terrifying
        path, I am so afraid. I have sought the Protection of the Saints;
        please, save me!  || </p>

      <p> 2 ||   The Fascinating and Beauteous Beloved is the Giver of support
        to all. I bow low and fall at the Feet of the Guru; if only I
        could see the Lord!  || 3 ||   I have made many friends, but I
        am a sacrifice to the One alone. No one has all virtues; the Lord
        alone is filled to overflowing with them.  || 4 ||   His Name
        is chanted in the four directions; those who chant it are embellished
        with peace. I seek Your Protection; Nanak is a sacrifice to You.
        || 5 ||   The Guru reached out to me, and gave me His Arm; He
        lifted me up, out of the pit of emotional attachment. I have won
        the incomparable life, and I shall not lose it again.  || 6 ||
        I have obtained the treasure of all; His Speech is unspoken
        and subtle. In the Court of the Lord, I am honored and glorified;
        I swing my arms in joy.  || 7 ||   Servant Nanak has received
        the invaluable and incomparable jewel. Serving the Guru, I cross
        over the terrifying world-ocean; I proclaim this loudly to all.

        of the One Lord with your tongue, and ask for Him alone.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Renounce your ego, and dwell upon the spiritual
        wisdom of the Guru. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny,
        join the Sangat, the Holy Congregation.  || 1 ||   Whatever you
        see, shall not go with you. The foolish, faithless cynics are
        attached  -  they waste away and die.  || 2 ||   The Name of
        the Fascinating Lord is all-pervading forever. Among millions,
        how rare is that Gurmukh who attains the Name.  || 3 ||   Greet
        the Lord's Saints humbly, with deep respect. You shall obtain
        the nine treasures, and receive infinite peace.  || 4 ||   With
        your eyes, behold the holy people; in your heart, sing the treasure
        of the Naam.  || 5 ||   Abandon sexual desire, anger, greed and
        emotional attachment. Thus you shall be rid of both birth and
        death.  || 6 ||   Pain and darkness shall depart from your home,
        when the Guru implants spiritual wisdom within you, and lights
        that lamp.  || 7 ||   One who serves the Lord crosses over to
        the other side. O servant Nanak, the Gurmukh saves the world.
        || 8 || 1 || 13 ||   FIFTH MEHL,  GAUREE:  Dwelling upon the
        Lord, Har, Har, and the Guru, the Guru, my doubts have been dispelled.
        My mind has obtained all comforts.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I was
        burning, on fire, and the Guru poured water on me; He is cooling
        and soothing, like the sandalwood tree.  || 1 ||   The darkness
        of ignorance has been dispelled; the Guru has lit the lamp of
        spiritual wisdom.  || 2 ||   The ocean of fire is so deep; the
        Saints have crossed over, in the boat of the Lord's Name.
        || 3 ||   I have no good karma; I have no Dharmic faith or purity.
        But God has taken me by the arm, and made me His own.  || 4 ||
        The Destroyer of fear, the Dispeller of pain, the Lover of His
        Saints  -  these are the Names of the Lord.  || 5 ||   He is
        the Master of the masterless, Merciful to the meek, All-powerful,
        the Support of His Saints.  || 6 ||   I am worthless  -  I
        offer this prayer, O my Lord King: &quot;Please, grant me the
        Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.&quot;  || 7 ||   Nanak has come

        pleasures; engrossed in them, the blind fool does not understand.
        || 1 ||   &quot;I am earning profits, I am getting rich&quot;,
        he says, as his life passes away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   &quot;I

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  TRUTH IS THE NAME.
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  BY GURU'S GRACE: </p>
        <p> RAAG GAUREE POORBEE,  CHHANT,  FIRST MEHL:</p>
      </center>
      <p> For the bride, the night is painful; sleep does not come. The
        soul-bride has grown weak, in the pain of separation from her
        Husband Lord. The soul-bride is wasting away, in the pain of separation
        from her Husband; how can she see Him with her eyes? Her decorations,
        sweet foods, sensuous pleasures and delicacies are all false;
        they are of no account at all. Intoxicated with the wine of youthful
        pride, she has been ruined, and her breasts no longer yield milk.
        O Nanak, the soul-bride meets her Husband Lord, when He causes
        her to meet Him; without Him, sleep does not come to her.  ||
        1 ||   The bride is dishonored without her Beloved Husband Lord.
        How can she find peace, without enshrining Him in her heart? Without
        her Husband, her home is not worth living in; go and ask your
        sisters and companions. Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        there is no love and affection; but with her True Lord, she abides
        in peace. Through mental truthfulness and contentment, union with
        the True Friend is attained; through the Guru's Teachings,
        the Husband Lord is known. O Nanak, that soul-bride who does not
        abandon the Naam, is intuitively absorbed in the Naam.  || 2 ||
        Come, O my sisters and companions  -  let's enjoy our
        Husband Lord. I will ask the Guru, and write His Word as my love-note.
        The Guru has shown me the True Word of the Shabad. The self-willed
        manmukhs will regret and repent. My wandering mind became steady,
        when I recognized the True One. The Teachings of Truth are forever
        new; the love of the Shabad is forever fresh. O Nanak, through
        the Glance of Grace of the True Lord, celestial peace is obtained;
        let's meet Him, O my sisters and companions.  || 3 ||   My
        desire has been fulfilled  -  my Friend has come to my home.
        At the Union of husband and wife, the songs of rejoicing were
        sung. Singing the songs of joyful praise and love to Him, the
        soul-bride's mind is thrilled and delighted. My friends are
        happy, and my enemies are unhappy; meditating on the True Lord,
        the true profit is obtained. With her palms pressed together,
        the soul-bride prays, that she may remain immersed in the Love
        of her Lord, night and day. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, the Husband Lord and the soul-bride revel together; my
        desires are fulfilled.  || 4 || 1 ||   GAUREE,  CHHANT,  FIRST
        MEHL:  Hear me, O my Dear Husband God  -  I am all alone in
        the wilderness. How can I find comfort without You, O my Carefree
        Husband God? The soul-bride cannot live without her Husband; the
        night is so painful for her. Sleep does not come. I am in love
        with my Beloved. Please, listen to my prayer! Other than my Beloved,
        no one cares for me; I cry all alone in the wilderness. O Nanak,
        the bride meets Him when He causes her to meet Him; without her
        Beloved, she suffers in pain.  || 1 ||   She is separated from
        her Husband Lord  -  who can unite her with Him? Tasting His
        Love, she meets Him, through the Beautiful Word of His Shabad.
        Adorned with the Shabad, she obtains her Husband, and her body
        is illuminated with the lamp of spiritual wisdom. Listen, O my
        friends and companions  -  she who is at peace dwells upon
        the True Lord and His True Praises. Meeting the True Guru, she
        is ravished and enjoyed by her Husband Lord; she blossoms forth
        with the Ambrosial Word of His Bani. O Nanak, the Husband Lord
        enjoys His bride when she is pleasing to His Mind.  || 2 ||  
        Fascination with Maya made her homeless; the false are cheated
        by falsehood. How can the noose around her neck be untied, without
        the Most Beloved Guru? One who loves the Beloved Lord, and reflects
        upon the Shabad, belongs to Him. How can giving donations to charities
        and countless cleansing baths wash off the filth within the heart?
        Without the Naam, no one attains salvation. Stubborn self-discipline
        and living in the wilderness are of no use at all. O Nanak, the
        home of Truth is attained through the Shabad. How can the Mansion
        of His Presence be known through duality?  || 3 ||   True is Your
        Name, O Dear Lord; True is contemplation of Your Shabad. True
        is the Mansion of Your Presence, O Dear Lord, and True is trade
        in Your Name. Trade in Your Name is very sweet; the devotees earn
        this profit night and day. Other than this, I can think of no
        other merchandise. So chant the Naam each and every moment. The
        account is read; by the Grace of the True Lord and good karma,
        the Perfect Lord is obtained. O Nanak, the Nectar of the Name
        is so sweet. Through the Perfect True Guru, it is obtained.  ||

        her Beloved Lord; without the Guru, the Mansion of His Presence
        is not found. Whatever the Guru says, she should surely do, to
        extinguish the fire of desire. The Lord is True; there is no one
        except Him. Without serving Him, peace is not found. O Nanak,
        that soul-bride, whom the Lord Himself unites, is united with
        Him; He Himself merges with her.  || 1 ||   The life-night of
        the soul-bride is blessed and joyful, when she focuses her consciousness
        on her Dear Lord. She serves the True Guru with love; she eradicates
        selfishness from within. Eradicating selfishness and conceit from
        within, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, she is in

        Lord's Glories, and you shall be loved by your Husband, embracing
        love for the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, the soul-bride
        who wears the necklace of the Lord's Name around her neck
        is loved by her Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   The soul-bride who is
        without her beloved Husband is all alone. She is cheated by the
        love of duality, without the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Without
        the Shabad of her Beloved, how can she cross over the treacherous
        ocean? Attachment to Maya has led her astray. Ruined by falsehood,
        she is deserted by her Husband Lord. The soul-bride does not attain
        the Mansion of His Presence. But she who is attuned to the Guru's
        Shabad is intoxicated with celestial love; night and day, she
        remains absorbed in Him. O Nanak, that soul-bride who remains
        constantly steeped in His Love, is blended by the Lord into Himself.
        || 3 ||   If the Lord merges us with Himself, we are merged with
        Him. Without the Dear Lord, who can merge us with Him? Without
        our Beloved Guru, who can dispel our doubt? Through the Guru,
        doubt is dispelled. O my mother, this is the way to meet Him;
        this is how the soul-bride finds peace. Without serving the Guru,
        there is only pitch darkness. Without the Guru, the Way is not
        found. That wife who is intuitively imbued with the color of His
        Love, contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad. O Nanak,
        the soul-bride obtains the Lord as her Husband, by enshrining
        love for the Beloved Guru.  || 4 || 1 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD MEHL:
        Without my Husband, I am utterly dishonored. Without my Husband
        Lord, how can I live, O my mother? Without my Husband, sleep does
        not come, and my body is not adorned with my bridal dress. The
        bridal dress looks beautiful upon my body, when I am pleasing
        to my Husband Lord. Following the Guru's Teachings, my consciousness
        is focused on Him. I become His happy soul-bride forever, when
        I serve the True Guru; I sit in the Lap of the Guru. Through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, the soul-bride meets her Husband
        Lord, who ravishes and enjoys her. The Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is the only profit in this world. O Nanak, the soul-bride is loved
        by her Husband, when she dwells upon the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord.  || 1 ||   The soul-bride enjoys the Love of her Beloved.
        Imbued with His Love night and day, she contemplates the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad. Contemplating the Guru's Shabad,
        she conquers her ego, and in this way, she meets her Beloved.
        She is the happy soul-bride of her Lord, who is forever imbued
        with the Love of the True Name of her Beloved. Abiding in the
        Company of our Guru, we grasp the Ambrosial Nectar; we conquer
        and cast out our sense of duality. O Nanak, the soul-bride attains
        her Husband Lord, and forgets all her pains.  || 2 ||   The soul-bride
        has forgotten her Husband Lord, because of love and emotional
        attachment to Maya. The false bride is attached to falsehood;
        the insincere one is cheated by insincerity. She who drives out
        her falsehood, and acts according to the Guru's Teachings,
        does not lose her life in the gamble. One who serves the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad is absorbed in the True Lord; she eradicates
        egotism from within. So let the Name of the Lord abide within
        your heart; decorate yourself in this way. O Nanak, the soul-bride
        who takes the Support of the True Name is intuitively absorbed
        in the Lord.  || 3 ||   Meet me, O my Dear Beloved. Without You,
        I am totally dishonored. Sleep does not come to my eyes, and I
        have no desire for food or water. I have no desire for food or
        water, and I am dying from the pain of separation. Without my
        Husband Lord, how can I find peace? </p>

      <p> I offer my prayers to the Guru; if it pleases the Guru, He shall
        unite me with Himself. The Giver of peace has united me with Himself;
        He Himself has come to my home to meet me. O Nanak, the soul-bride
        is forever the Lord's favorite wife; her Husband Lord does
        not die, and He shall never leave.  || 4 || 2 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD
        MEHL:  The soul-bride is pierced through with the sublime essence
        of the Lord, in intuitive peace and poise. The Enticer of hearts
        has enticed her, and her sense of duality has been easily dispelled.
        Her sense of duality has been easily dispelled, and the soul-bride
        obtains her Husband Lord; following the Guru's Teachings,
        she makes merry. This body is filled to overflowing with falsehood,
        deception and the commission of sins. The Gurmukh practices that
        devotional worship, by which the celestial music wells up; without
        this devotional worship, filth is not removed. O Nanak, the soul-bride
        who sheds selfishness and conceit from within, is dear to her
        Beloved.  || 1 ||   The soul-bride has found her Husband Lord,
        through the love and affection of the Guru. She passes her life-night
        sleeping in peace, enshrining the Lord in her heart. Enshrining
        Him deep within her heart night and day, she meets her Beloved,
        and her pains depart. Deep within the mansion of her inner being,
        she enjoys her Husband Lord, reflecting upon the Guru's Teachings.
        She drinks deeply of the Nectar of the Naam, day and night; she
        conquers and casts off her sense of duality. O Nanak, the happy
        soul-bride meets her True Lord, through the Infinite Love of the
        Guru.  || 2 ||   Come, and shower Your Mercy upon me, my most
        Darling, Dear Beloved. The soul-bride offers her prayers to You,
        to adorn her with the True Word of Your Shabad. Adorned with the
        True Word of Your Shabad, she conquers her ego, and as Gurmukh,
        her affairs are resolved. Throughout the ages, the One Lord is
        True; through the Guru's Wisdom, He is known. The self-willed
        manmukh is engrossed in sexual desire, and tormented by emotional
        attachment. With whom should she lodge her complaints? O Nanak,
        the self-willed manmukh finds no place of rest, without the most
        Beloved Guru.  || 3 ||   The bride is foolish, ignorant and unworthy.
        Her Husband Lord is Unapproachable and Incomparable. He Himself
        unites us in His Union; He Himself forgives us. The soul-bride's
        Beloved Husband Lord is the Forgiver of sins; He is contained
        in each and every heart. The True Guru has made me understand
        this understanding, that the Lord is obtained through love, affection
        and loving devotion. She remains forever in bliss, day and night;
        she remains immersed in His Love, night and day. O Nanak, that
        soul-bride who obtains the nine treasures, intuitively obtains
        her Husband Lord.  || 4 || 3 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD MEHL:  The sea
        of Maya is agitated and turbulent; how can anyone cross over this
        terrifying world-ocean? Make the Lord's Name your boat, and
        install the Word of the Shabad as the boatman. With the Shabad
        installed as the boatman, the Lord Himself shall take you across.
        In this way, the difficult ocean is crossed. The Gurmukh obtains
        devotional worship of the Lord, and thus remains dead while yet
        alive. In an instant, the Lord's Name erases his sinful mistakes,
        and his body becomes pure. O Nanak, through the Lord's Name,
        emancipation is obtained, and the slag iron is transformed into
        gold.  || 1 || </p>

      <p> Men and women are obsessed with sex; they do not know the Way
        of the Lord's Name. Mother, father, children and siblings
        are very dear, but they drown, even without water. They are drowned
        to death without water  -  they do not know the path of salvation,
        and they wander around the world in egotism. All those who come
        into the world shall depart. Only those who contemplate the Guru
        shall be saved. Those who become Gurmukh and chant the Lord's
        Name, save themselves and save their families as well. O Nanak,
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within their hearts;
        through the Guru's Teachings, they meet their Beloved.  ||
        2 ||   Without the Lord's Name, nothing is stable. This world
        is just a drama. Implant true devotional worship within your heart,
        and trade in the Name of the Lord. Trade in the Lord's Name
        is infinite and unfathomable. Through the Guru's Teachings,
        this wealth is obtained. This selfless service, meditation and
        devotion is true, if you eliminate selfishness and conceit from
        within. I am senseless, foolish, idiotic and blind, but the True
        Guru has placed me on the Path. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are adorned
        with the Shabad; night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 3 ||   He Himself acts, and inspires others to
        act; He Himself embellishes us with the Word of His Shabad. He
        Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is the Shabad; in each
        and every age, He loves His devotees. In age after age, He loves
        His devotees; the Lord Himself adorns them, and He Himself enjoins
        them to worship Him with devotion. He Himself is All-knowing,
        and He Himself is All-seeing; He inspires us to serve Him. He
        Himself is the Giver of merits, and the Destroyer of demerits;
        He causes His Name to dwell within our hearts. Nanak is forever
        a sacrifice to the True Lord, who Himself is the Doer, the Cause
        of causes.  || 4 || 4 ||   GAUREE,  THIRD MEHL:  Serve the Guru,
        O my dear soul; meditate on the Lord's Name. Do not leave
        me, O my dear soul  -  you shall find the Lord while sitting
        within the home of your own being. You shall obtain the Lord while
        sitting within the home of your own being, focusing your consciousness
        constantly upon the Lord, with true intuitive faith. Serving the
        Guru brings great peace; they alone do it, whom the Lord inspires
        to do so. They plant the seed of the Name, and the Name sprouts
        within; the Name abides within the mind. O Nanak, glorious greatness
        rests in the True Name; It is obtained by perfect pre-ordained
        destiny.  || 1 ||   The Name of the Lord is so sweet, O my dear;
        taste it, and focus your consciousness on it. Taste the sublime
        essence of the Lord with your tongue, my dear, and renounce the
        pleasures of other tastes. You shall obtain the everlasting essence
        of the Lord when it pleases the Lord; your tongue shall be adorned
        with the Word of His Shabad. Meditating on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, a lasting peace is obtained; so remain lovingly focused
        on the Naam. From the Naam we originate, and into the Naam we
        shall pass; through the Naam, we are absorbed in the Truth. O
        Nanak, the Naam is obtained through the Guru's Teachings;
        He Himself attaches us to it.  || 2 ||   Working for someone else,
        O my dear, is like forsaking the bride, and going to foreign countries.
        In duality, no one has ever found peace, O my dear; you are greedy
        for corruption and greed. Greedy for corruption and greed, and
        deluded by doubt, how can anyone find peace? Working for strangers
        is very painful; doing so, one sells himself and loses his faith
        in the Dharma. </p>

      <p> Bound by Maya, the mind is not stable. Each and every moment,
        it suffers in pain. O Nanak, the pain of Maya is taken away by
        focusing one's consciousness on the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 3 ||   The self-willed manmukhs are foolish and crazy,
        O my dear; they do not enshrine the Shabad within their minds.
        The delusion of Maya has made them blind, O my dear; how can they
        find the Way of the Lord? How can they find the Way, without the
        Will of the True Guru? The manmukhs foolishly display themselves.
        The Lord's servants are forever comfortable. They focus their
        consciousness on the Guru's Feet. Those unto whom the Lord
        shows His Mercy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord forever.
        O Nanak, the jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the only
        profit in this world. The Lord Himself imparts this understanding
        to the Gurmukh.  || 4 || 5 || 7 || </p>

      </center>
      <p> My mind has become sad and depressed; how can I see God, the Great
        Giver? My Friend and Companion is the Dear Lord, the Guru, the
        Architect of Destiny. The One Lord, the Architect of Destiny,
        is the Master of the Goddess of Wealth; how can I, in my sadness,
        meet You? My hands serve You, and my head is at Your Feet. My
        mind, dishonored, yearns for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
        With each and every breath, I think of You, day and night; I do
        not forget You, for an instant, even for a moment. O Nanak, I
        am thirsty, like the sparrow-hawk; how can I meet God, the Great
        Giver?  || 1 ||   I offer this one prayer  -  please listen,
        O my Beloved Husband Lord. My mind and body are enticed, beholding
        Your wondrous play. Beholding Your wondrous play, I am enticed;
        but how can the sad, forlorn bride find contentment? My Lord is
        Meritorious, Merciful and Eternally Young; He is overflowing with
        all excellences. The fault is not with my Husband Lord, the Giver
        of peace; I am separated from Him by my own mistakes. Prays Nanak,
        please be merciful to me, and return home, O my Beloved Husband
        Lord.  || 2 ||   I surrender my mind, I surrender my whole body;
        I surrender all my lands. I surrender my head to that beloved
        friend, who brings me news of God. I have offered my head to the
        Guru, the most exalted; He has shown me that God is with me. In
        an instant, all suffering is removed. I have obtained all my mind's
        desires. Day and night, the soul-bride makes merry; all her anxieties
        are erased. Prays Nanak, I have met the Husband Lord of my longing.
        || 3 ||   My mind is filled with bliss, and congratulations are
        pouring in. My Darling Beloved has come home to me, and all my
        desires have been satisfied. I have met my Sweet Lord and Master
        of the Universe, and my companions sing the songs of joy. All
        my friends and relatives are happy, and all traces of my enemies
        have been removed. The unstruck melody vibrates in my home, and
        the bed has been made up for my Beloved. Prays Nanak, I am in
        celestial bliss. </p>

        lofty, and your mansion is unsurpassed. O Mohan, your gates are
        so beautiful. They are the worship-houses of the Saints. In these
        incomparable worship-houses, they continually sing Kirtan, the
        Praises of their Lord and Master. Where the Saints and the Holy
        gather together, there they meditate on you. Be Kind and Compassionate,
        O Merciful Lord; be Merciful to the meek. Prays Nanak, I thirst
        for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; receiving Your Darshan,
        I am totally at peace.  || 1 ||   O Mohan, your speech is incomparable;
        wondrous are your ways. O Mohan, you believe in the One. Everything
        else is dust to you. You adore the One Lord, the Unknowable Lord
        and Master; His Power gives Support to all. Through the Guru's
        Word, you have captured the heart of the Primal Being, the Lord
        of the World. You Yourself move, and You Yourself stand still;
        You Yourself support the whole creation. Prays Nanak, please preserve
        my honor; all Your servants seek the Protection of Your Sanctuary.
        || 2 ||   O Mohan, the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, meditates
        on you; they meditate on the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. O
        Mohan, the Messenger of Death does not even approach those who
        meditate on You, at the last moment. The Messenger of Death cannot
        touch those who meditate on You single-mindedly. Those who worship
        and adore You in thought, word and deed, obtain all fruits and
        rewards. Those who are foolish and stupid, filthy with urine and
        manure, become all-knowing upon gaining the Blessed Vision of
        Your Darshan. Prays Nanak, Your Kingdom is Eternal, O Perfect
        Primal Lord God.  || 3 ||   O Mohan, you have blossomed forth
        with the flower of your family. O Mohan, your children, friends,
        siblings and relatives have all been saved. You save those who
        give up their egotistical pride, upon gaining the Blessed Vision
        of Your Darshan. The Messenger of Death does not even approach
        those who call you 'blessed'. Your Virtues are unlimited
        -  they cannot be described, O True Guru, Primal Being, Destroyer
        of demons. Prays Nanak, Yours is that Anchor, holding onto which
        the whole world is saved.  || 4 || 2 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL,
        SHALOK:  Countless sinners have been purified; I am a sacrifice,

        Name is the fire which burns away sinful mistakes like straw.
        || 1 ||   CHHANT:  Meditate, O my mind, on the Lord God, the
        Lord of the Universe, the Lord, the Master of Wealth. Meditate,
        O my mind, on the Lord, the Destroyer of ego, the Giver of salvation,
        who cuts away the noose of agonizing death. Meditate lovingly
        on the Lotus Feet of the Lord, the Destroyer of distress, the
        Protector of the poor, the Lord of excellence. The treacherous
        path of death and the terrifying ocean of fire are crossed over
        by meditating in remembrance on the Lord, even for an instant.
        Meditate day and night on the Lord, the Destroyer of desire, the
        Purifier of pollution. Prays Nanak, please be Merciful to me,
        O Cherisher of the world, Lord of the Universe, Lord of wealth.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, remember the Lord in meditation; He is the
        Destroyer of pain, the Eradicator of fear, the Sovereign Lord
        King. He is the Greatest Lover, the Merciful Master, the Enticer
        of the mind, the Support of His devotees  -  this is His very

        Lord is our Sanctuary; He is the Enticer of the mind, who banishes
        all sorrows. All illnesses, sufferings and pains are dispelled,

        the Sustainer of the Universe, the Great Giver; He is the Cherisher
        of all. The Cherisher Lord is so very merciful and wise; He is
        compassionate to all. The pains of death, greed and emotional
        attachment simply vanish, when God comes to dwell in the soul.
        When the Lord is thoroughly pleased, then one's service becomes
        perfectly fruitful. Prays Nanak, my desires are fulfilled by meditating
        on the Lord, Merciful to the meek.  || 4 || 3 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Listen, O my companions: let's join together and make
        the effort, to surrender to our Husband Lord. Renouncing our pride,
        let's charm Him with the potion of devotional worship, and
        the mantra of the Holy Saints. O my companions, when He comes
        under our power, He shall never leave us again. This is the good
        nature of the Lord God. O Nanak, God dispels the fear of old age,
        death and hell; He purifies His beings.  || 1 ||   Listen, O my
        companions, to my sincere prayer: let's make this firm resolve.
        In the peaceful poise of intuitive bliss, violence will be gone,
        as we sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Our
        pains and troubles shall be eradicated, and our doubts shall be
        dispelled; we will receive the fruits of our minds' desires.
        O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Supreme Lord God,
        the Perfect, Transcendent Lord.  || 2 ||   O my companions, I
        yearn for Him continually; I invoke His Blessings, and pray that
        God may fulfill my hopes. I thirst for His Feet, and I long for
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; I look for Him everywhere.
        I search for traces of the Lord in the Society of the Saints;
        they will unite me with the All-powerful Primal Lord God. O Nanak,
        those humble, noble beings who meet the Lord, the Giver of peace,
        are very blessed, O my mother.  || 3 ||   O my companions, now
        I dwell with my Beloved Husband; my mind and body are attuned
        to the Lord. Listen, O my companions: now I sleep well, since
        I found my Husband Lord. My doubts have been dispelled, and I
        have found intuitive peace and tranquility through my Lord and
        Master. I have been enlightened, and my heart-lotus has blossomed
        forth. I have obtained God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of
        hearts, as my Husband; O Nanak, my marriage shall last forever.
