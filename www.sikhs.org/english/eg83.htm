      <p> <font color="#000000">If, in his conscious mind, he places his hopes
        in the Lord, then he shall obtain the fruits of all the many desires
        of his mind. The Lord knows everything which happens to the soul.
        Not even an iota of one's effort goes to waste. Place your
        hopes in the Lord, O my mind; the Lord and Master is pervading
        and permeating all.  || 1 ||   O my mind, place your hopes in
        the Lord of the World, the Master of the Universe. That hope which
        is placed in any other than the Lord - that hope is fruitless,
        and totally useless.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That which you can
        see, Maya, and all attachment to family - don't
        place your hopes in them, or your life will be wasted and lost.
        Nothing is in their hands; what can these poor creatures do? By
        their actions, nothing can be done. O my mind, place your hopes
        in the Lord, your Beloved, who shall carry you across, and save
        your whole family as well.  || 2 ||   If you place your hopes
        in any other, in any friend other than the Lord, then you shall
        come to know that it is of no use at all. This hope placed in
        other friends comes from the love of duality. In an instant, it
        is gone; it is totally false. O my mind, place your hopes in the
        Lord, your True Beloved, who shall approve and reward you for
        all your efforts.  || 3 ||   Hope and desire are all Yours, O
        my Lord and Master. <br>

      </p>
      <p> As You inspire hope, so are the hopes held. Nothing is in the
        hands of anyone, O my Lord and Master; such is the understanding
        the True Guru has given me to understand. You alone know the hope
        of servant Nanak, O Lord; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the
        Lord's Darshan, he is satisfied.  || 4 || 1 ||   GOND,
        FOURTH MEHL:  Serve such a Lord, and ever meditate on Him, who
        in an instant erases all sins and mistakes. If someone forsakes
        the Lord and places his hopes in another, then all his service
        to the Lord is rendered fruitless. O my mind, serve the Lord,
        the Giver of peace; serving Him, all your hunger shall depart.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, place your faith in the Lord. Wherever I
        go, my Lord and Master is there with me. The Lord saves the honor
        of His humble servants and slaves.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If you
        tell your sorrows to another, then he, in return, will tell you
        of his greater sorrows. So tell your sorrows to the Lord, your
        Lord and Master, who shall instantly dispel your pain. Forsaking
        such a Lord God, if you tell your sorrows to another, then you
        shall die of shame.  || 2 ||   The relatives, friends and siblings
        of the world that you see, O my mind, all meet with you for their
        own purposes. And that day, when their self-interests are not
        served, on that day, they shall not come near you. O my mind,
        serve your Lord, day and night; He shall help you in good times
        and bad.  || 3 ||   Why place your faith in anyone, O my mind,
        who cannot come to your rescue at the last instant? Chant the
        Lord's Mantra, take the Guru's Teachings, and meditate
        on Him. In the end, the Lord saves those who love Him in their
        consciousness. Servant Nanak speaks: night and day, chant the
        Lord's Name, O Saints; this is the only true hope for emancipation.
        || 4 || 2 ||   GOND,  FOURTH MEHL:  Remembering the Lord in meditation,
        you shall find bliss and peace forever deep within, and your mind
        will become tranquil and cool. It is like the harsh sun of Maya,
        with its burning heat; seeing the moon, the Guru, its heat totally
        vanishes.  || 1 ||   O my mind, night and day, meditate, and chant
        the Lord's Name. Here and hereafter, He shall protect you,
        everywhere; serve such a God forever.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate
        on the Lord, who contains all treasures, O my mind; as Gurmukh,
        search for the jewel, the Lord. Those who meditate on the Lord,
        find the Lord, my Lord and Master; I wash the feet of those slaves
        of the Lord.  || 2 ||   One who realizes the Word of the Shabad,
        obtains the sublime essence of the Lord; such a Saint is lofty
        and sublime, the greatest of the great. The Lord Himself magnifies
        the glory of that humble servant. <br>

      </p>
      <p> No one can lessen or decrease that glory, not even a bit.  ||
        3 ||   He shall give you peace, O my mind; meditate forever, every
        day on Him, with your palms pressed together. Please bless servant
        Nanak with this one gift, O Lord, that Your feet may dwell within
        my heart forever.  || 4 || 3 ||   GOND,  FOURTH MEHL:  All the
        kings, emperors, nobles, lords and chiefs are false and transitory,
        engrossed in duality - know this well. The eternal Lord
        is permanent and unchanging; meditate on Him, O my mind, and you
        shall be approved.  || 1 ||   O my mind, vibrate, and meditate
        on the Lord's Name, which shall be your defender forever.
        One who obtains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, through
        the Word of the Guru's Teachings - no one else's
        power is as great as his.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All the wealthy,
        high class property owners which you see, O my mind, shall vanish,
        like the fading color of the safflower. Serve the True, Immaculate
        Lord forever, O my mind, and you shall be honored in the Court
        of the Lord.  || 2 ||   There are four castes: Brahmin, Kh'shaatriya,
        Soodra and Vaishya, and there are four stages of life. One who
        meditates on the Lord, is the most distinguished and renowned.
        The poor castor oil plant, growing near the sandalwood tree, becomes
        fragrant; in the same way, the sinner, associating with the Saints,
        becomes acceptable and approved.  || 3 ||   He, within whose heart
        the Lord abides, is the highest of all, and the purest of all.
        Servant Nanak washes the feet of that humble servant of the Lord;
        he may be from a low class family, but he is now the Lord's
        servant.  || 4 || 4 ||   GOND,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord, the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts, is all-pervading. As the Lord causes them
        to act, so do they act. So serve forever such a Lord, O my mind,
        who will protect you from everything.  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate
        on the Lord, and read about the Lord every day. Other than the
        Lord, no one can kill you or save you; so why do you worry, O
        my mind?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Creator created the entire
        universe, and infused His Light into it. The One Lord speaks,
        and the One Lord causes all to speak.The Perfect Guru has revealed
        the One Lord.  || 2 ||   The Lord is with you, inside and out;
        tell me, O mind, how can You hide anything from Him? Serve the
        Lord open-heartedly, and then, O my mind, you shall find total
        peace.  || 3 ||   Everything is under His control; He is the greatest
        of all. O my mind, meditate forever on Him. O Servant Nanak, that
        Lord is always with you. Meditate forever on your Lord, and He
        shall emancipate you.  || 4 || 5 ||   GOND,  FOURTH MEHL:  My
        mind yearns so deeply for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan, like the thirsty man without water.  || 1 ||   My mind
        is pierced through by the arrow of the Lord's Love. The
        Lord God knows my anguish, and the pain deep within my mind.

      <p> <font color="#000000">He is the Creator of all, He is the Enjoyer
        of all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Creator listens, and the Creator
        sees. The Creator is unseen, and the Creator is seen. The Creator
        forms, and the Creator destroys. The Creator touches, and the
        Creator is detached.  || 1 ||   The Creator is the One who speaks,
        and the Creator is the One who understands. The Creator comes,
        and the Creator also goes. The Creator is absolute and without
        qualities; the Creator is related, with the most excellent qualities.
        By Guru's Grace, Nanak looks upon all the same.  || 2 ||
        1 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are caught, like the fish and the
        monkey; you are entangled in the transitory world. Your foot-steps
        and your breaths are numbered; only by singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord will you be saved.  || 1 ||   O mind, reform yourself,
        and forsake your aimless wandering. You have found no place of
        rest for yourself; so why do you try to teach others?  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Like the elephant, driven by sexual desire, you are
        attached to your family. People are like birds that come together,
        and fly apart again; you shall become stable and steady, only
        when you meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, in the Company of the
        Holy.  || 2 ||   Like the fish, which perishes because of its
        desire to taste, the fool is ruined by his greed. You have fallen
        under the power of the five thieves; escape is only possible in
        the Sanctuary of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Be Merciful to me, O Destroyer
        of the pains of the meek; all beings and creatures belong to You.
        May I obtain the gift of always seeing the Blessed Vision of Your
        Darshan; meeting with You, Nanak is the slave of Your slaves.

      <p> His treasure is overflowing with the rubies of the Name. He gives
        Support to all hearts.  || 3 ||   The Name is the True Primal
        Being; millions of sins are washed away in an instant, singing
        His Praises. The Lord God is your best friend, your playmate from
        earliest childhood. He is the Support of the breath of life; O
        Nanak, He is love, He is consciousness.  || 4 || 1 || 3 ||  ||
        GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  I trade in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        The Naam is the Support of the mind. My consciousness takes to
        the Shelter of the Naam. Chanting the Naam, millions of sins are
        erased.  || 1 ||   The Lord has blessed me with the wealth of
        the Naam, the Name of the One Lord. The wish of my mind is to
        meditate on the Naam, in association with the Guru.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   The Naam is the wealth of my soul. Wherever I go,
        the Naam is with me. The Naam is sweet to my mind. In the water,
        on the land, and everywhere, I see the Naam.  || 2 ||   Through
        the Naam, one's face becomes radiant in the Court of the
        Lord. Through the Naam, all one's generations are saved.
        Through the Naam, my affairs are resolved. My mind is accustomed
        to the Naam.  || 3 ||   Through the Naam, I have become fearless.
        Through the Naam, my comings and goings have ceased. The Perfect
        Guru has united me with the Lord, the treasure of virtue. Says
        Nanak, I dwell in celestial peace.  || 4 || 2 || 4 ||   GOND,
        FIFTH MEHL:  He grants honor to the dishonored, and gives gifts
        to all the hungry; he protects those in the terrible womb. So
        humbly bow forever to that Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   Meditate
        on such a God in your mind. He shall be your help and support
        everywhere, in good times and bad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The beggar
        and the king are all the same to Him. He sustains and fulfills
        both the ant and the elephant. He does not consult or seek anyone's
        advice. Whatever He does, He does Himself.  || 2 ||   No one knows
        His limit. He Himself is the Immaculate Lord. He Himself is formed,
        and He Himself is formless. In the heart, in each and every heart,
        He is the Support of all hearts.  || 3 ||   Through the Love of
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the devotees become His Beloveds.
        Singing the Praises of the Creator, the Saints are forever in
        bliss. Through the Love of the Naam, the Lord's humble
        servants remain satisfied. Nanak falls at the feet of those humble
        servants of the Lord.  || 4 || 3 || 5 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Associating with them, this mind becomes immaculate and pure.
        Associating with them, one meditates in remembrance on the Lord,
        Har, Har. Associating with them, the residues of sinful mistakes
        are erased. Associating with them, the heart is illumined.  ||
        1 ||   Those Saints of the Lord are my friends. It is their custom
        to sing only the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   By their mantra, the Lord, Har, Har, dwells in the mind.
        By their teachings, doubt and fear are dispelled. By their kirtan,
        they become immaculate and sublime. The world longs for the dust
        of their feet.  || 2 ||   Millions of sinners are saved by associating
        with them. They have the Support of the Name of the One Formless
        Lord. He knows the secrets of all beings; He is the treasure of
        mercy, the divine immaculate Lord.  || 3 ||   When the Supreme
        Lord God becomes merciful, then one meets the Merciful Holy Guru. <br>

      <p> Day and night, Nanak meditates on the Naam. Through the Lord's
        Name, he is blessed with peace, poise and bliss.  || 4 || 4 ||
        6 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate on the image of the Guru within
        your mind; let your mind accept the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, and His Mantra. Enshrine the Guru's feet within
        your heart. Bow in humility forever before the Guru, the Supreme
        Lord God.  || 1 ||   Let no one wander in doubt in the world.
        Without the Guru, no one can cross over.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        The Guru shows the Path to those who have wandered off. He leads
        them to renounce others, and attaches them to devotional worship
        of the Lord. He obliterates the fear of birth and death. The glorious
        greatness of the Perfect Guru is endless.  || 2 ||   By Guru's
        Grace, the inverted heart-lotus blossoms forth, and the Light
        shines forth in the darkness. Through the Guru, know the One who
        created you. By the Guru's Mercy, the foolish mind comes
        to believe.  || 3 ||   The Guru is the Creator; the Guru has the
        power to do everything. The Guru is the Transcendent Lord; He
        is, and always shall be. Says Nanak, God has inspired me to know
        this. Without the Guru, liberation is not obtained, O Siblings
        of Destiny.  || 4 || 5 || 7 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  Chant Guru,
        Guru, Guru, O my mind. I have no other than the Guru. I lean upon
        the Support of the Guru, day and night. No one can decrease His
        bounty.  || 1 ||   Know that the Guru and the Transcendent Lord
        are One. Whatever pleases Him is acceptable and approved.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   One whose mind is attached to the Guru's
        feet - his pains, sufferings and doubts run away. Serving
        the Guru, honor is obtained. I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru.
        || 2 ||   Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's
        Darshan, I am exalted. The work of the Guru's servant is
        perfect. Pain does not afflict the Guru's servant. The
        Guru's servant is famous in the ten directions.  || 3 ||
        The Guru's glory cannot be described. The Guru remains
        absorbed in the Supreme Lord God. Says Nanak, one who is blessed
        with perfect destiny - his mind is attached to the Guru's
        feet.  || 4 || 6 || 8 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  I worship and adore
        my Guru; the Guru is the Lord of the Universe. My Guru is the
        Supreme Lord God; the Guru is the Lord God. My Guru is divine,
        invisible and mysterious. I serve at the Guru's feet, which
        are worshipped by all.  || 1 ||   Without the Guru, I have no
        other place at all. Night and day, I chant the Name of Guru, Guru.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru is my spiritual wisdom, the Guru
        is the meditation within my heart. The Guru is the Lord of the
        World, the Primal Being, the Lord God. With my palms pressed together,
        I remain in the Guru's Sanctuary. Without the Guru, I have
        no other at all.  || 2 ||   The Guru is the boat to cross over
        the terrifying world-ocean. Serving the Guru, one is released
        from the Messenger of Death. In the darkness, the Guru's
        Mantra shines forth. With the Guru, all are saved.  || 3 ||  
        The Perfect Guru is found, by great good fortune. Serving the
        Guru, pain does not afflict anyone. No one can erase the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad. <br>

        ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  Deal and trade only with the Lord, Raam,
        Raam. The Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, is the Support of the breath
        of life. Sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord, Raam, Raam,
        Raam. The Lord is ever-present, all-pervading.  || 1 ||   Joining
        the humble Saints, chant the Lord's Name. This is the most
        immaculate and perfect occupation of all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Gather the treasure, the wealth of the Lord, Raam, Raam. Let
        your sustenance be the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. Never forget the
        Lord, Raam, Raam. In His Mercy, the Guru has revealed this to
        me.  || 2 ||   The Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, is always our help
        and support. Embrace love for the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. Through
        the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, I have become immaculate. The sinful
        residues of countless incarnations have been taken away.  || 3
        ||   Uttering the Lord's Name, birth and death are finished.
        Repeating the Lord's Name, one crosses over the terrifying
        world-ocean. The Luminous Lord is the highest of all. Night and
        day, servant Nanak meditates on Him.  || 4 || 8 || 10 ||   GOND,
        FIFTH MEHL:  My Lord and Master has held back the five demons.
        He conquered them, and scared them away from the Lord's
        slave. They cannot find the mansion of the Lord's devotee.
        Joining together, the Lord's humble servants sing the songs
        of joy.  || 1 ||   The five demons are the rulers of the whole
        world, but they are just water-carriers for the Lord's
        devotee.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They collect taxes from the world,
        but they bow in subservience to God's devotees. They plunder
        and dishonor the faithless cynics, but they massage and wash the
        feet of the Holy.  || 2 ||   The One Mother gave birth to the
        five sons, and began the play of the created world. With the three
        qualities joined together, they celebrate. Renouncing these three
        qualities, the Lord's humble servants rise above them.
        || 3 ||   In His Mercy, He saves His humble servants. They belong
        to Him, and so He saves them by driving out the five. Says Nanak,
        devotion to God is noble and sublime. Without devotion, all just
        waste away uselessly.  || 4 || 9 || 11 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Suffering and troubles are eradicated by the Lord's Name.
        Pain is dispelled, and peace takes its place. Meditating, chanting
        the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, I am satisfied. By the
        Grace of the Saints, I have received all fruitful rewards.  ||
        1 ||   Meditating on the Lord, His humble servant is carried across,
        and the sins of countless incarnations are taken away.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I have enshrined the Guru's feet within my
        heart, and crossed over the ocean of fire. All the painful diseases
        of birth and death have been eradicated. I am attached to God
        in celestial Samaadhi.  || 2 ||   In all places and interspaces,
        the One, our Lord and Master is contained. He is the Inner-knower
        of all hearts. One whom the Lord blesses with understanding, chants
        the Name of God, twenty-four hours a day.  || 3 ||   Deep within,
        God Himself abides; within his heart, the Divine Light shines
        forth. With loving devotion, sing the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises. Meditate on the Supreme Lord God, O Nanak, and you shall
        be saved.  || 4 || 10 || 12 || <br>

      <p> GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  Bow in humility to the lotus feet of the Guru.
        Eliminate sexual desire and anger from this body. Be the dust
        of all, and see the Lord in each and every heart, in all.  ||
        1 ||   In this way, dwell upon the Lord of the World, the Lord
        of the Universe. My body and wealth belong to God; my soul belongs
        to God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Twenty-four hours a day, sing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord. This is the purpose of human life.
        Renounce your egotistical pride, and know that God is with you.
        By the Grace of the Holy, let your mind be imbued with the Lord's
        Love.  || 2 ||   Know the One who created you, and in the world
        hereafter you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. Your
        mind and body will be immaculate and blissful; chant the Name
        of the Lord of the Universe with your tongue.  || 3 ||   Grant
        Your Kind Mercy, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek. My mind begs
        for the dust of the feet of the Holy. Be merciful, and bless me
        with this gift, that Nanak may live, chanting God's Name.
        || 4 || 11 || 13 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  My incense and lamps
        are my service to the Lord. Time and time again, I humbly bow
        to the Creator. I have renounced everything, and grasped the Sanctuary
        of God. By great good fortune, the Guru has become pleased and
        satisfied with me.  || 1 ||   Twenty-four hours a day, I sing
        of the Lord of the Universe. My body and wealth belong to God;
        my soul belongs to God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Chanting the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, I am in bliss. The Supreme Lord God is the
        Perfect Forgiver. Granting His Mercy, He has linked His humble
        servants to His service. He has rid me of the pains of birth and
        death, and merged me with Himself.  || 2 ||   This is the essence
        of karma, righteous conduct and spiritual wisdom, to chant the
        Lord's Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
        God's Feet are the boat to cross over the world-ocean.
        God, the Inner-knower, is the Cause of causes.  || 3 ||   Showering
        His Mercy, He Himself has saved me. The five hideous demons have
        run away. Do not lose your life in the gamble. The Creator Lord
        has taken Nanak's side.  || 4 || 12 || 14 ||   GOND,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  In His Mercy, He has blessed me with peace and bliss. The
        Divine Guru has saved His child. God is kind and compassionate;
        He is the Lord of the Universe. He forgives all beings and creatures.
        || 1 ||   I seek Your Sanctuary, O God, O Merciful to the meek.
        Meditating on the Supreme Lord God, I am forever in ecstasy. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There is no other like the Merciful Lord
        God. He is contained deep within each and every heart. He embellishes
        His slave, here and hereafter. It is Your nature, God, to purify
        sinners.  || 2 ||   Meditation on the Lord of the Universe is
        the medicine to cure millions of illnesses. My Tantra and Mantra
        is to meditate, to vibrate upon the Lord God. Illnesses and pains
        are dispelled, meditating on God. The fruits of the mind's
        desires are fulfilled.  || 3 ||   He is the Cause of causes, the
        All-powerful Merciful Lord. Contemplating Him is the greatest
        of all treasures. God Himself has forgiven Nanak; forever and
        ever, he chants the Name of the One Lord.  || 4 || 13 || 15 ||

        of your mind and body shall be taken away, and all your pain and
        darkness will be dispelled.  || 1 ||   Singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, cross over the world-ocean. By great good fortune,
        one attains the Infinite Lord, the Primal Being.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Messenger of Death cannot even touch that humble being,
        who sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. The Gurmukh
        realizes his Lord and Master; his coming into this world is approved.
        || 2 ||   He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, by the Grace
        of the Saints; his sexual desire, anger and madness are eradicated.
        He knows the Lord God to be ever-present. This is the Perfect
        Teaching of the Perfect Guru.  || 3 ||   He earns the treasure
        of the Lord's wealth. Meeting with the True Guru, all his
        affairs are resolved. He is awake and aware in the Love of the
        Lord's Name; O Nanak, his mind is attached to the Lord's
        Feet.  || 4 || 14 || 16 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord's
        Feet are the boat to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. Meditating
        in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he does not
        die again. Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, he does
        not have to walk on the Path of Death. Contemplating the Supreme
        Lord, the five demons are conquered.  || 1 ||   I have entered
        Your Sanctuary, O Perfect Lord and Master. Please give Your hand
        to Your creatures.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Simritees, Shaastras,
        Vedas and Puraanas expound upon the Supreme Lord God. The Yogis,
        celibates, Vaishnavs and followers of Ram Das cannot find the
        limits of the Eternal Lord God.  || 2 ||   Shiva and the gods
        lament and moan, but they do not understand even a tiny bit of
        the unseen and unknown Lord. One whom the Lord Himself blesses
        with loving devotional worship, is very rare in this world.  ||
        3 ||   I am worthless, with absolutely no virtue at all; all treasures
        are in Your Glance of Grace. Nanak, the meek, desires only to
        serve You. Please be merciful, and grant him this blessing, O
        Divine Guru.  || 4 || 15 || 17 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who
        is cursed by the Saints, is thrown down on the ground. The slanderer
        of the Saints is thrown down from the skies. I hold the Saints
        close to my soul. The Saints are saved instantaneously.  || 1
        ||   He alone is a Saint, who is pleasing to the Lord. The Saints,
        and God, have only one job to do.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God gives
        His hand to shelter the Saints. He dwells with His Saints, day
        and night. With each and every breath, He cherishes His Saints.
        He takes the power away from the enemies of the Saints.  || 2
        ||   Let no one slander the Saints. Whoever slanders them, will
        be destroyed. One who is protected by the Creator Lord, cannot
        be harmed, no matter how much the whole world may try.  || 3 ||
        I place my faith in my God. My soul and body all belong to Him.
        This is the faith which inspires Nanak: the self-willed manmukhs
        will fail, while the Gurmukhs will always win.  || 4 || 16 ||
        18 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Name of the Immaculate Lord is
        the Ambrosial Water. Chanting it with the tongue, sins are washed
        away. <br>

        not fall into hell. Serving the Lord, all fruitful rewards are
        obtained.  || 1 ||   Within my mind is the Support of the Lord.
        The Lord is the boat to cross over the world-ocean. Chant the
        Lord's Name, and the Messenger of Death will run away.
        The Lord breaks the teeth of Maya, the witch.  || 2 ||   The Lord
        is forever and ever the Forgiver. The Lord blesses us with peace
        and bliss. The Lord has revealed His glory. The Lord is the mother
        and father of His Saint.  || 3 ||   The Lord, the Lord, is in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Time and time again,
        I sing the Lord's Praises. Meeting with the Guru, I have
        attained the incomprehensible object. Slave Nanak has grasped
        the Support of the Lord.  || 4 || 17 || 19 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:
        One who is protected by the Protector Lord - the Formless
        Lord is on his side.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the mother's
        womb, the fire does not touch him. Sexual desire, anger, greed
        and emotional attachment do not affect him. In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, he meditates on the Formless Lord. Dust
        is thrown into the faces of the slanderers.  || 1 ||   The Lord's
        protective spell is the armor of His slave. The wicked, evil demons
        cannot even touch him. Whoever indulges in egotistical pride,
        shall waste away to ruin. God is the Sanctuary of His humble slave.
        || 2 ||   Whoever enters the Sanctuary of the Sovereign Lord
        - He saves that slave, hugging him close in His embrace.
        Whoever takes great pride in himself, in an instant, shall be
        like dust mixing with dust.  || 3 ||   The True Lord is, and shall
        always be. Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. Granting
        His Mercy, He saves His slaves. God is the Support of Nanak's
        breath of life.  || 4 || 18 || 20 ||   GOND,  FIFTH MEHL:  Wondrous
        and beautiful is the description of the beauty of the Supreme
        Soul, the Supreme Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is not old;
        He is not young. He is not in pain; He is not caught in Death's
        noose. He does not die; He does not go away. In the beginning,
        and throughout the ages, He is permeating everywhere.  || 1 ||
        He is not hot; He is not cold. He has no enemy; He has no friend.
        He is not happy; He is not sad. Everything belongs to Him; He
        can do anything.  || 2 ||   He has no father; He has no mother.
        He is beyond the beyond, and has always been so. He is not affected
        by virtue or vice. Deep within each and every heart, He is always
        awake and aware.  || 3 ||   From the three qualities, the one
        mechanism of Maya was produced. The great Maya is only His shadow.
        He is undeceivable, impenetrable, unfathomable and merciful. He
        is merciful to the meek, forever compassionate. His state and
        limits cannot ever be known. Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice
        to Him.  || 4 || 19 || 21 || <br>

        victory.  || 2 ||   Supreme bliss fills the minds of the Saints.
        The Saints meditate on the Divine Guru, the Lord God. The faces
        of His companions become radiant and bright. The slanderers lose
        all places of rest.  || 3 ||   With each and every breath, the
        Lord's humble slaves praise Him. The Supreme Lord God and
        the Guru are care-free. All fears are eradicated, in His Sanctuary.
        Smashing all the slanderers, the Lord knocks them to the ground.
        || 4 ||   Let no one slander the Lord's humble servants.
        Whoever does so, will be miserable. Twenty-four hours a day, the
        Lord's humble servant meditates on Him alone. The Messenger
        of Death does not even approach him.  || 5 ||   The Lord's
        humble servant has no vengeance. The slanderer is egotistical.
        The Lord's humble servant wishes well, while the slanderer
        dwells on evil. The Sikh of the Guru meditates on the True Guru.
        The Lord's humble servants are saved, while the slanderer
        is cast into hell.  || 6 ||   Listen, O my beloved friends and
        companions: these words shall be true in the Court of the Lord.
        As you plant, so shall you harvest. The proud, egotistical person
        will surely be uprooted.  || 7 ||   O True Guru, You are the Support
        of the unsupported. Be merciful, and save Your humble servant.
        Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru; remembering Him in meditation,
        my honor has been saved.  || 8 || 1 || 29 || </font><br>
