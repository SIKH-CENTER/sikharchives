        <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.</b>
        <p> <b>TRUTH IS THE NAME.</b> </p>
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  NO FEAR.  NO HATRED. </p>
        <p> IMAGE OF THE UNDYING.  BEYOND BIRTH.  SELF-EXISTENT. </p>
        <p> BY GURU'S GRACE: </p>
        <p> RAAG GUJRI,  FIRST MEHL,  CHAU-PADAS,  FIRST HOUSE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> I would make Your Name the sandalwood, and my mind the stone to
        rub it on; for saffron, I would offer good deeds; thus, I perform
        worship and adoration within my heart.  || 1 ||   Perform worship
        and adoration by meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord;
        without the Name, there is no worship and adoration.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   If one were to wash his heart inwardly, like the
        stone idol which is washed on the outside, his filth would be
        removed, his soul would be cleansed, and he would be liberated
        when he departs.  || 2 ||   Even beasts have value, as they eat
        grass and give milk. Without the Naam, the mortal's life
        is cursed, as are the actions he performs.  || 3 ||   The Lord
        is hear at hand  -  do not think that He is far away. He always
        cherishes us, and remembers us. Whatever He gives us, we eat;
        says Nanak, He is the True Lord.  || 4 || 1 ||   GUJRI,  FIRST
        MEHL:  From the lotus of Vishnu's navel, Brahma was born;
        He chanted the Vedas with a melodious voice. He could not find
        the Lord's limits, and he remained in the darkness of coming
        and going.  || 1 ||   Why should I forget my Beloved?  He is the
        support of my very breath of life. The perfect beings perform
        devotional worship to Him. The silent sages serve Him through
        the Guru's Teachings.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   His lamps are
        the sun and the moon; the One Light of the Destroyer of ego fills
        the three worlds. One who becomes Gurmukh remains immaculately
        pure, day and night, while the self-willed manmukh is enveloped
        by the darkness of night.  || 2 ||   The Siddhas in Samaadhi are
        continually in conflict; what can they see with their two eyes?
        One who has the Divine Light within his heart, and is awakened
        to the melody of the Word of the Shabad  -  the True Guru settles
        his conflicts.  || 3 ||   O Lord of angels and men, infinite and
        unborn, Your True Mansion is incomparable. Nanak merges imperceptibly
        into the Life of the world; shower Your mercy upon him, and save
        him.  || 4 || 2 || </p>

        RAAG GUJRI,  THIRD MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Cursed is that life, in which the Lord's Love is not obtained.
        Cursed is that occupation, in which the Lord is forgotten, and
        one becomes attached to duality.  || 1 ||   Serve such a True
        Guru, O my mind, that by serving Him, God's Love may be produced,
        and all others may be forgotten. Your consciousness shall remain
        attached to the Lord; there shall be no fear of old age, and the
        supreme status shall be obtained.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   A divine
        peace wells up from God's Love; behold, it comes from devotional
        worship. When my identity consumed my identical identity, then
        my mind became immaculately pure, and my light was blended with
        the Divine Light.  || 2 ||   Without good fortune, such a True
        Guru cannot be found, no matter how much all may yearn for Him.
        If the veil of falsehood is removed from within, then lasting
        peace is obtained.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, what service can the servant
        perform for such a True Guru? He should offer his life, his very
        soul, to the Guru. If he focuses his consciousness on the Will
        of the True Guru, then the True Guru Himself will bless him. 
        || 4 || 1 || 3 ||   GUJRI,  THIRD MEHL:  Serve the Lord; do not
        serve anyone else. Serving the Lord, you shall obtain the fruits
        of your heart's desires; serving another, your life shall
        pass away in vain.  || 1 ||   The Lord is my Love, the Lord is
        my way of life, the Lord is my speech and conversation. By Guru's
        Grace, my mind is saturated with the Lord's Love; this is
        what makes up my service.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is my
        Simritees, the Lord is my Shaastras; the Lord is my relative and
        the Lord is my brother. I am hungry for the Lord; my mind is satisfied
        with the Name of the Lord. The Lord is my relation, my helper
        in the end.  || 2 ||   Without the Lord, other assets are false.
        They do not go with the mortal when he departs. The Lord is my
        wealth, which shall go with me; wherever I go, it will go.  ||
        3 ||   One who is attached to falsehood is false; false are the
        deeds he does. Says Nanak, everything happens according to the
        Will of the Lord; no one has any say in this at all.  || 4 ||
        2 || 4 ||   GUJRI,  THIRD MEHL:  It is so difficult to obtain
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in this age; only the Gurmukh
        obtains it. Without the Name, no one is liberated; let anyone
        make other efforts, and see.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to my
        Guru; I am forever a sacrifice to Him. Meeting the True Guru,
        the Lord comes to dwell in the mind, and one remains absorbed
        in Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When God instills His fearl, a balanced
        detachment springs up in the mind. Through this detachment, the
        Lord is obtained, and one remains absorbed in the Lord.  || 2
        ||   He alone is liberated, who conquers his mind; Maya does not
        stick to him again. He dwells in the Tenth Gate, and obtains the
        understanding of the three worlds.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, through
        the Guru, one becomes the Guru; behold, His Wondrous Will. </p>

      </p>
      <p> This deed was done by the Creator Lord; one's light merges
        into the Light.  || 4 || 3 || 5 ||   GUJRI,  THIRD MEHL:  Everyone
        chants the Lord's Name, Raam, Raam; but by such chanting,
        the Lord is not obtained. By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes
        to dwell in the mind, and then, the fruits are obtained.  || 1
        ||   One who enshrines love for God within his mind, never forgets
        the Lord; he continually chants the Lord's Name, Har, Har,
        in his conscious mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those whose hearts
        are filled with hypocrisy, who are called saints only for their
        outward show  -  their desires are never satisfied, and they
        depart grieving in the end.  || 2 ||   Although one may bathe
        at many places of pilgrimage, still, his ego never departs. That
        man, whose sense of duality does not depart  -  the Righteous
        Judge of Dharma shall punish him.  || 3 ||   That humble being,
        unto whom God showers His Mercy, obtains Him; how few are the
        Gurmukhs who understand Him. O Nanak, if one conquers his ego
        within, then he comes to meet the Lord.  || 4 || 4 || 6 ||   GUJRI,
        THIRD MEHL:  That humble being who eliminates his ego is at peace;
        he is blessed with an ever-stable intellect. That humble being
        is immaculately pure, who, as Gurmukh, understands the Lord, and
        focuses his consciousness on the Lord's Feet.  || 1 ||  
        O my unconscious mind, remain conscious of the Lord, and you shall
        obtain the fruits of your desires. By Guru's Grace, you shall
        obtain the sublime elixir of the Lord; by continually drinking
        it in, you shall have eternal peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When
        one meets the True Guru, he becomes the philosopher's stone,
        with the ability to transform others, inspiring them to worship
        the Lord. One who worships the Lord in adoration, obtains his
        rewards; instructing others, he reveals the Truth.  || 2 ||  
        Without becoming the philosopher's stone, he does not inspire
        others to worship the Lord; without instructing his own mind,
        how can he instruct others? The ignorant, blind man calls himself
        the guru, but to whom can he show the way?  || 3 ||   O Nanak,
        without His Mercy, nothing can be obtained. One upon whom He casts
        His Glance of Grace, obtains Him. By Guru's Grace, God bestows
        greatness, and projects the Word of His Shabad.  || 4 || 5 ||
        7 ||   GUJRI,  THIRD MEHL,  PANCH-PADAS:  Wisdom is not produced
        in Benares, nor is wisdom lost in Benares. Meeting the True Guru,
        wisdom is produced, and then, one obtains this understanding.
        || 1 ||   Listen to the sermon of the Lord, O mind, and enshrine
        the Shabad of His Word within your mind. If your intellect remains
        stable and steady, then doubt shall depart from within you.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Enshrine the Lord's lotus feet within your
        heart, and your sins shall be erased. If your soul overcomes the
        five elements, then you shall come to have a home at the true
        place of pilgrimage.  || 2 ||   This mind of the self-centered
        manmukh is so stupid; it does not obtain any understanding at
        all. It does not understand the Name of the Lord; it departs repenting
        in the end.  || 3 ||   In this mind are found Benares, all sacred
        shrines of pilgrimage and the Shaastras; the True Guru has explained
        this. The sixty-eight places of pilgrimage remain with one, whose
        heart is filled with the Lord.  || 4 ||   O Nanak, upon meeting
        the True Guru, the Order of the Lord's Will is understood,
        and the One Lord comes to dwell in the mind. Those who are pleasing
        to You, O True Lord, are true. </p>

      </p>
      <p> They remain absorbed in You.  || 5 || 6 || 8 ||   GUJRI,  THIRD
        MEHL:  The One Name is the treasure, O Pandit. Listen to these
        True Teachings. No matter what you read in duality, reading and
        contemplating it, you shall only continue to suffer.  || 1 ||
        So grasp the Lord's lotus feet; through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, you shall come to understand. With your tongue,
        taste the sublime elixir of the Lord, and your mind shall be rendered
        immaculately pure.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meeting the True Guru,
        the mind becomes content, and then, hunger and desire will not
        trouble you any longer. Obtaining the treasure of the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, one does not go knocking at other doors.  ||
        2 ||   The self-willed manmukh babbles on and on, but he does
        not understand. One whose heart is illumined, by Guru's Teachings,
        obtains the Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||   You may listen to the
        Shaastras, but you do not understand, and so you wander from door
        to door. He is a fool, who does not understand his own self, and
        who does not enshrine love for the True Lord.  || 4 ||   The True
        Lord has fooled the world  -  no one has any say in this at
        all. O Nanak, He does whatever He pleases, according to His Will.

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> RAAG GUJRI,  FOURTH MEHL,  CHAU-PADAS,  FIRST HOUSE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> O Servant of the Lord, O True Guru, O True Primal Being, I offer
        my prayers to You, O Guru. I am an insect and a worm; O True Guru,
        I seek Your Sanctuary; please, be merciful and bestow upon me
        the Light of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O my Best
        Friend, O Divine Guru, please illuminate me with the Light of
        the Lord. By Guru's Instructions, the Naam is my breath of
        life, and the Praise of the Lord is my occupation.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Lord's servants have the greatest good fortune;
        they have faith in the Lord, Har, Har, and a thirst for the Lord.
        Obtaining the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, they are satisfied;
        joining the Company of the Holy, their virtues shine forth.  ||
        2 ||   Those who have not obtained the essence of the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, are most unfortunate; they are taken away
        by the Messenger of Death. Those who have not sought the Sanctuary
        of the True Guru and the Company of the Holy  -  cursed are
        their lives, and cursed are their hopes of life.  || 3 ||   Those
        humble servants of the Lord, who have obtained the Company of
        the True Guru, have such pre-ordained destiny written on their
        foreheads. Blessed, blessed is the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
        where the sublime essence of the Lord is obtained. Meeting with
        His humble servant, O Nanak, the Naam shines forth.  || 4 || 1
        ||   GUJRI,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord, the Lord of the Universe
        is the Beloved of the minds of those who join the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation. The Shabad of His Word fascinates their
        minds. Chant, and meditate on the Lord, the Lord of the Universe;
        God is the One who gives gifts to all.  || 1 ||   O my Siblings
        of Destiny, the Lord of the Universe, Govind, Govind, Govind,
        has enticed and fascinated my mind. I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord of the Universe, Govind, Govind, Govind; joining the
        Holy Society of the Guru, Your humble servant is beautified. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Devotional worship to the Lord is an ocean
        of peace; through the Guru's Teachings, wealth, prosperity and
        the spiritual powers of the Siddhas fall at our feet. </p>

      <p> The Lord's Name is the Support of His humble servant; he
        chants the Lord's Name, and with the Lord's Name he
        is adorned.  || 2 ||   Evil-minded, unfortunate and shallow-minded
        are those who feel anger in their minds, when they hear the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. You may place ambrosial nectar before crows
        and ravens, but they will be satisfied only by eating manure and
        dung with their mouths.  || 3 ||   The True Guru, the Speaker
        of Truth, is the pool of Ambrosial Nectar; bathing within it,
        the crow becomes a swan. O Nanak, blessed, blessed and very fortunate
        are those who, through the Guru's Teachings, with the Naam, wash
        away the filth of their hearts.  || 4 || 2 ||   GUJRI,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  The humble servants of the Lord are exalted, and exalted
        is their speech. With their mouths, they speak for the benefit
        of others. Those who listen to them with faith and devotion, are
        blessed by the Lord; showering His Mercy, He saves them.  || 1
        ||   Lord, please, let me meet the beloved servants of the Lord.
        The True Guru, the Perfect Guru, is my Beloved, my very breath
        of life; the Guru has saved me, the sinner.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The Gurmukhs are fortunate, so very fortunate; their Support
        is the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. They obtain the Ambrosial Nectar
        of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; through the Guru's Teachings,
        they obtain this treasure-house of devotional worship.  || 2 ||
        Those who do not obtain the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of
        the True Guru, the True Primal Being, are most unfortunate; they
        are destroyed by the Messenger of Death. They are like dogs, pigs
        and jackasses; they are cast into the womb of reincarnation, and
        the Lord strikes them down as the worst of murderers.  || 3 ||
        O Lord, Kind to the poor, please shower Your mercy upon Your
        humble servant, and save him. Servant Nanak has entered the Lord's
        Sanctuary; if it pleases You, Lord, please save him.  || 4 ||
        3 ||   GUJRI,  FOURTH MEHL:  Be Merciful and attune my mind, so
        that I might meditate continually on the Lord's Name, night
        and day. The Lord is all peace, all virtue and all wealth; remembering
        Him, all misery and hunger depart.  || 1 ||   O my mind, the Lord's
        Name is my companion and brother. Under Guru's Instruction,
        I sing the Praises of the Lord's Name; it shall be my help
        and support in the end, and it shall deliver me in the Court of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You Yourself are the Giver, O
        God, Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts; by Your Grace, You have
        infused longing for You in my mind. My mind and body long for
        the Lord; God has fulfilled my longing. I have entered the Sanctuary
        of the True Guru.  || 2 ||   Human birth is obtained through good
        actions; without the Name, it is cursed, totally cursed, and it
        passes away in vain. Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one
        obtains only suffering for his delicacies to eat. His mouth is
        insipid, and his face is spat upon, again and again.  || 3 ||
        Those humble beings, who have entered the Sanctuary of the Lord
        God, Har, Har, are blessed with glory in the Court of the Lord,
        Har, Har. Blessed, blessed and congratulations, says God to His
        humble servant. O servant Nanak, He embraces him, and blends him
        with Himself.  || 4 || 4 ||   GUJRI,  FOURTH MEHL:  O Gurmukhs,
        O my friends and companions, give me the gift of the Lord's
        Name, the life of my very life. I am the slave, the servant of
        the Guru's Sikhs, who meditate on the Lord God, the Primal
        Being, night and day.  || 1 ||   Within my mind and body, I have
        enshrined love for the feet of the Guru's Sikhs. </p>

        me in the Teachings, that I might merge in the Lord's Merger.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When it pleases the Lord God, he causes
        us to meet the Gurmukhs; the Hymns of the Guru, the True Guru,
        are very sweet to their minds. Very fortunate are the beloved
        Sikhs of the Guru; through the Lord, they attain the supreme state
        of Nirvaanaa.  || 2 ||   The Sat Sangat, the True Congregation
        of the Guru, is loved by the Lord. The Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, is sweet and pleasing to their minds. One who does not
        obtain the Association of the True Guru, is a most unfortunate
        sinner; he is consumed by the Messenger of Death.  || 3 ||   If
        God, the Kind Master, Himself shows His kindness, then the Lord
        causes the Gurmukh to merge into Himself. Servant Nanak chants
        the Glorious Words of the Guru's Bani; through them, one
        is absorbed into the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 5 ||
        GUJRI,  FOURTH MEHL:  One who has found the Lord God through
        the True Guru, has made the Lord seem so sweet to me, through
        the His Teachings. My mind and body have been cooled and soothed,
        and totally rejuvenated; by great good fortune, I meditate on
        the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, let anyone
        who can implant the Lord's Name within me, come and meet
        with me. Unto my Beloved, I give my mind and body, and my very
        breath of life. He speaks to me of the sermon of my Lord God.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Through the Guru's Teachings, I have
        obtained courage, faith and the Lord. He keeps my mind focused
        continually on the Lord, and the Name of the Lord. The Words of
        the True Guru's Teachings are Ambrosial Nectar; this Amrit
        trickles into the mouth of the one who chants them.  || 2 || 
        Immaculate is the Naam, which cannot be stained by filth. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, chant the Naam with love. That man
        who has not found the wealth of the Naam is most unfortunate;
        he dies over and over again.  || 3 ||   The source of bliss, the
        Life of the world, the Great Giver brings bliss to all who meditate
        on the Lord. You are the Great Giver, all beings belong to You.
        O servant Nanak, You forgive the Gurmukhs, and merge them into
        Yourself.  || 4 || 6 || </p>

      <p> Why, O mind, do you contrive your schemes, when the Dear Lord
        Himself provides for your care? From rocks and stones, He created
        the living beings, and He places before them their sustenance.
        || 1 ||   O my Dear Lord of Souls, one who meets with the Sat
        Sangat, the True Congregation, is saved. By Guru's Grace,
        he obtains the supreme status, and the dry branch blossoms forth
        in greenery.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Mother, father, friends, children,
        and spouse  -  no one is the support of any other. For each
        and every individual, the Lord and Master provides sustenance;
        why do you fear, O my mind?  || 2 ||   The flamingoes fly hundreds
        of miles, leaving their young ones behind. Who feeds them, and
        who teaches them to feed themselves? Have you ever thought of
        this in your mind?  || 3 ||   All treasures and the eighteen supernatural
        spiritual powers of the Siddhas are held by the Lord and Master
        in the palm of His hand. Servant Nanak is devoted, dedicated,

      <p> They perform the four rituals and six religious rites; the world
        is engrossed in these. They are not cleansed of the filth of their
        ego within; without the Guru, they lose the game of life.  ||
        1 ||   O my Lord and Master, please, grant Your Grace and preserve
        me. Out of millions, hardly anyone is a servant of the Lord. All
        the others are mere traders.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have searched
        all the Shaastras, the Vedas and the Simritees, and they all affirm
        one thing: without the Guru, no one obtains liberation; see, and
        reflect upon this in your mind.  || 2 ||   Even if one takes cleansing
        baths at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and wanders
        over the whole planet, and performs all the rituals of purification
        day and night, still, without the True Guru, there is only darkness.
        || 3 ||   Roaming and wandering around, I have travelled over
        the whole world, and now, I have arrived at the Lord's Door.
        The Lord has eliminated my evil-mindedness, and enlightened my
        intellect; O servant Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved.  || 4 || 1
        || 2 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  The wealth of the Lord is my chanting,
        the wealth of the Lord is my deep meditation; the wealth of the
        Lord is the food I enjoy. I do not forget the Lord, Har, Har,
        from my mind, even for an instant; I have found Him in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||   O mother, your son
        has returned home with a profit: the wealth of the Lord while
        walking, the wealth of the Lord while sitting, and the wealth
        of the Lord while waking and sleeping.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        wealth of the Lord is my cleansing bath, the wealth of the Lord
        is my wisdom; I center my meditation on the Lord. The wealth of
        the Lord is my raft, the wealth of the Lord is my boat; the Lord,
        Har, Har, is the ship to carry me across. </p>

        From the wealth of the Lord, I have obtained the nine treasures;
        the true essence of the Lord has come into my hands.  || 3 ||
        No matter how much I eat and expend this wealth, it is not exhausted;
        here and hereafter, it remains with me. Loading the treasure,
        Guru Nanak has given it, and this mind is imbued with the Lord's
        Love.  || 4 || 2 || 3 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  Remembering Him,
        all sins are erased, and ones generations are saved. So meditate
        continually on the Lord, Har, Har; He has no end or limitation.
        || 1 ||   O son, this is your mother's hope and prayer,
        that you may never forget the Lord, Har, Har, even for an instant.
        May you ever vibrate upon the Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||

        the Society of the Saints. May the preservation of your honor
        by the Transcendent Lord be your clothes, and may the singing
        of His Praises be your food.  || 2 ||   So drink in forever the
        Ambrosial Nectar; may you live long, and may the meditative remembrance
        of the Lord give you infinite delight. May joy and pleasure be
        yours; may your hopes be fulfilled, and may you never be troubled
        by worries.  || 3 ||   Let this mind of yours be the bumble bee,
        and let the Lord's feet be the lotus flower. Says servant
        Nanak, attach your mind to them, and blossom forth like the song-bird,
        upon finding the rain-drop.  || 4 || 3 || 4 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  He decides to go to the west, but the Lord leads him away
        to the east. In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes;
        He holds all matters in His hands.  || 1 ||   Cleverness is of
        no use at all. Whatever my Lord and Master deems to be right  - 
        that alone comes to pass.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In his desire
        to acquire land and accumulate wealth, one's breath escapes
        him. He must leave all his armies, assistants and servants; rising
        up, he departs to the City of Death.  || 2 ||   Believing himself
        to be unique, he clings to his stubborn mind, and shows himself
        off. That food, which the blameless people have condemned and
        discarded, he eats again and again.  || 3 ||   One, unto whom
        the Lord shows His natural mercy, has the noose of Death cut away
        from him. Says Nanak, one who meets the Perfect Guru, is celebrated
        as a householder as well as a renunciate.  || 4 || 4 || 5 || 
        GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those humble beings who chant the treasure
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, have their bonds broken. Sexual
        desirer, anger, the poison of Maya and egotism  -  they are
        rid of these afflictions.  || 1 ||   One who joins the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, and chants the Praises of the Lord, has
        his mind purified, by Guru's Grace, and he obtains the joy
        of all joys.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever the Lord does, he
        sees that as good; such is the devotional service he performs.
        He sees friends and enemies as all the same; this is the sign
        of the Way of Yoga.  || 2 ||   The all-pervading Lord is fully
        filling all places; why should I go anywhere else? He is permeating
        and pervading within each and every heart; I am immersed in His
        Love, dyed in the color of His Love.  || 3 || </p>

        then one enters the home of the Fearless Lord. His troubles and
        worries are ended in an instant; O Nanak, he merges in celestial
        peace.  || 4 || 5 || 6 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  Whoever I approach
        to ask for help, I find him full of his own troubles. One who
        worships in his heart the Supreme Lord God, crosses over the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 1 ||   No one, except the Guru-Lord, can dispel
        our pain and sorrow. Forsaking God, and serving another, one's
        honor, dignity and reputation are decreased.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Relatives, relations and family bound through Maya are of
        no avail. The Lord's servant, although of lowly birth, is
        exalted. Associating with him, one obtains the fruits of his mind's
        desires.  || 2 ||   Through corruption, one may obtain thousands
        and millions of enjoyments, but even so, his desires are not satisfied
        through them. Remembering the Naam, the Name of the Lord, millions
        of lights appear, and the incomprehensible is understood.  ||
        3 ||   Wandering and roaming around, I have come to Your Door,
        Destroyer of fear, O Lord King. Servant Nanak yearns for the dust
        of the feet of the Holy; in it, he finds peace.  || 4 || 6 ||

        me the Name of the Lord, which my soul has come to treasure. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Surrounded by dear friends, relatives, children,
        siblings and spouse, he laughs playfully. But when the very last
        moment arrives, Death seizes him, while they merely look on. 
        || 2 ||   By continual oppression and exploitation, he accumulates
        wealth, gold, silver and money, but the load-bearer gets only
        paltry wages, while the rest of the money passes on to others.

        Lord of all creation; You give Your unique support to Your servant.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, Nanak has obtained understanding; singing the Kirtan of
        the Lord's Praises is his only support. The Lord's servants,
        Naam Dayv, Trilochan, Kabeer and Ravi Daas the shoe-maker have
        been liberated.  || 2 || 1 || 10 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  No

        the Lord.  || 1 ||   God's sermon is profound and unfathomable.
        He is heard to be one thing, but He is understood to be something
        else again; He is beyond description and explanation.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   He Himself is the devotee, and He Himself is the
        Lord and Master; He is imbued with Himself. Nanak's God is
        pervading and permeating everywhere; wherever he looks, He is
        there.  || 2 || 2 || 11 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  The humble servant
        of the Lord has no plans, politics or other clever tricks. Whenever
        the occasion arises, there, he meditates on the Lord. || 1 ||
        It is the very nature of God to love His devotees; He cherishes
        His servant, and caresses him as His own child.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Lord's servant sings the Kirtan of His Praises
        as his worship, deep meditation, self-discipline and religious
        observances. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master,

        everywhere, and she clings to the whole world. Says Nanak, she

        and Master. Giving me His hand, the Transcendent Lord has saved
        me, and erased all my sins.  || 1 ||   The Lord and Master Himself
        has become merciful. I have been emancipated, the embodiment of

        carried me across.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meeting her Husband,
        the soul-bride sings the songs of joy, and celebrates her Lord
        and Master. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru, who has
        emancipated everyone.  || 2 || 6 || 15 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Mother, father, siblings, children and relatives  -  their
        power is insignificant. I have seen the many pleasures of Maya,
        but none goes with them in the end.  || 1 ||   O Lord Master,
        other than You, no one is mine. I am a worthless orphan, devoid
        of merit; I long for Your Support.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Your lotus
        feet; here and hereafter, Yours is the only power. In the Saadh

        Vision of Your Darshan; my obligations to all others are annulled.

        doubt and emotional attachment, and leads us to love God. He implants
        this instruction in our minds, for us to sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, in peace and poise.  || 1 ||   O friend, the Saintly
        Guru is such a helper. Meeting Him, the bonds of Maya are released,
        and one never forgets the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Practicing,
        practicing various actions in so many ways, I came to recognize
        this as the best way. Joining the Company of the Holy, Nanak sings
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and crosses over the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 2 || 8 || 17 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  In an
        instant, He establishes and disestablishes; His value cannot be
        described. He turns the king into a beggar in an instant, and
        He infuses splendor into the lowly.  || 1 ||   Meditate forever
        on Your Lord. Why should I feel worry or anxiety, when I am here
        for only a short time.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are my support,
        O my Perfect True Guru; my mind has taken to the protection of
        Your Sanctuary. Nanak, I am a foolish and ignorant child; reach
        out to me with Your hand, Lord, and save me.  || 2 || 9 || 18

        come to dwell within my mind. That heart, within which Your lotus
        feet are enshrined, suffers no darkness or doubt.  || 1 ||   O
        Lord Master, wherever I remember You, there I find You. Show Mercy
        to me, O God, Cherisher of all, that I may sing Your Praises forever.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   With each and every breath, I contemplate
        Your Name; O God, I long for You alone. <br>
