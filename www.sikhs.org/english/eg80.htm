      <p> You are the all-powerful Cause of causes. Please cover my faults,
        Lord of the Universe, O my Guru; I am a sinner - I seek
        the Sanctuary of Your Feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever we
        do, You see and know; there is no way anyone can stubbornly deny
        this. Your glorious radiance is great! So I have heard, O God.
        Millions of sins are destroyed by Your Name.  || 1 ||   It is
        my nature to make mistakes, forever and ever; it is Your Natural
        Way to save sinners. You are the embodiment of kindness, and the
        treasure of compassion, O Merciful Lord; through the Blessed Vision
        of Your Darshan, Nanak has found the state of redemption in life.
        || 2 || 2 || 118 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Bless me with such
        mercy, Lord, that my forehead may touch the feet of the Saints,
        and my eyes may behold the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, and
        my body may fall at the dust of their feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        May the Word of the Guru's Shabad abide within my heart,
        and the Lord's Name be enshrined within my mind. Drive
        out the five thieves, O my Lord and Master, and let my doubts
        all burn like incense.  || 1 ||   Whatever You do, I accept as
        good; I have driven out the sense of duality. You are Nanak's
        God, the Great Giver; in the Congregation of the Saints, emancipate
        me.  || 2 || 3 || 119 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  I ask for such
        advice from Your humble servants, that I may meditate on You,
        and love You, and serve You, and become part and parcel of Your
        Being.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I serve His humble servants, and
        speak with them, and abide with them. I apply the dust of the
        feet of His humble servants to my face and forehead; my hopes,
        and the many waves of desire, are fulfilled.  || 1 ||   Immaculate
        and pure are the praises of the humble servants of the Supreme
        Lord God; the feet of His humble servants are equal to millions
        of sacred shrines of pilgrimage. Nanak bathes in the dust of the
        feet of His humble servants; the sinful resides of countless incarnations
        have been washed away.  || 2 || 4 || 120 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  If it pleases You, then cherish me. O Supreme Lord God,
        Transcendent Lord, O True Guru, I am Your child, and You are my
        Merciful Father.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am worthless; I have
        no virtues at all. I cannot understand Your actions. You alone
        know Your state and extent. My soul, body and property are all
        Yours.  || 1 ||   You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts,
        the Primal Lord and Master; You know even what is unspoken. My
        body and mind are cooled and soothed, O Nanak, by God's
        Glance of Grace.  || 2 || 5 || 121 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Keep me with You forever, O God. You are my Beloved, the Enticer
        of my mind; without You, my life is totally useless.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   In an instant, You transform the beggar into a king;
        O my God, You are the Master of the masterless. You save Your
        humble servants from the burning fire; You make them Your own,
        and with Your Hand, You protect them.  || 1 ||   I have found
        peace and cool tranquility, and my mind is satisfied; meditating
        in remembrance on the Lord, all struggles are ended. Service to
        the Lord, O Nanak, is the treasure of treasures; all other clever
        tricks are useless.  || <br>

      </p>
      <p> 2 || 6 || 122 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Never forget Your servant,
        O Lord. Hug me close in Your embrace, O God, my Lord and Master;
        consider my primal love for You, O Lord of the Universe.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   It is Your Natural Way, God, to purify sinners;
        please do not keep my errors in Your Heart. You are my life, my
        breath of life, O Lord, my wealth and peace; be merciful to me,
        and burn away the curtain of egotism.  || 1 ||   Without water,
        how can the fish survive? Without milk, how can the baby survive?
        Servant Nanak thirsts for the Lord's Lotus Feet; gazing
        upon the Blessed Vision of his Lord and Master's Darshan,
        he finds the essence of peace.  || 2 || 7 || 123 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Here, and hereafter, there is happiness. The Perfect
        Guru has perfectly, totally saved me; the Supreme Lord God has
        been kind to me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord, my Beloved, is
        pervading and permeating my mind and body; all my pains and sufferings
        are dispelled. In celestial peace, tranquility and bliss, I sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord; my enemies and adversaries have
        been totally destroyed.  || 1 ||   God has not considered my merits
        and demerits; in His Mercy, He has made me His own. Unweighable
        is the greatness of the immovable and imperishable Lord; Nanak
        proclaims the victory of the Lord.  || 2 || 8 || 124 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Without the Fear of God, and devotional worship,
        how can anyone cross over the world-ocean? Be kind to me, O Saving
        Grace of sinners; preserve my faith in You, O my Lord and Master.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The mortal does not remember the Lord in
        meditation; he wanders around intoxicated by egotism; he is engrossed
        in corruption like a dog. Utterly cheated, his life is slipping
        away; committing sins, he is sinking away.  || 1 ||   I have come
        to Your Sanctuary, Destroyer of pain; O Primal Immaculate Lord,
        may I dwell upon You in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
        O Lord of beautiful hair, Destroyer of pain, Eradicator of sins,
        Nanak lives, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.

      <p> <font color="#000000">He dwells close at hand, and sees all, but
        how rare is the Gurmukh who understands this. Without the Fear
        of God, there is no devotional worship. Imbued with the Word of
        the Shabad, eternal peace is attained.  || 1 ||   Such is the
        spiritual wisdom, the treasure of the Naam; obtaining it, the
        Gurmukhs enjoy the subtle essence of this nectar.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Everyone talks about spiritual wisdom and spiritual knowledge.
        Talking, talking, they argue, and suffer. No one can stop talking
        and discussing it. Without being imbued with the subtle essence,
        there is no liberation.  || 2 ||   Spiritual wisdom and meditation
        all come from the Guru. Through the lifestyle of Truth, the True
        Lord comes to dwell in the mind. The self-willed manmukh talks
        about it, but does not practice it. Forgetting the Name, he finds
        no place of rest.  || 3 ||   Maya has caught the mind in the trap
        of the whirlpool. Each and every heart is trapped by this bait
        of poison and sin. See that whoever has come, is subject to death.
        Your affairs shall be adjusted, if you contemplate the Lord in
        your heart.  || 4 ||   He alone is a spiritual teacher, who lovingly
        focuses his consciousness on the Word of the Shabad. The self-willed,
        egotistical manmukh loses his honor. The Creator Lord Himself
        inspires us to His devotional worship. He Himself blesses the
        Gurmukh with glorious greatness.  || 5 ||   The life-night is
        dark, while the Divine Light is immaculate. Those who lack the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, are false, filthy and untouchable.
        The Vedas preach sermons of devotional worship. Listening, hearing
        and believing, one beholds the Divine Light.  || 6 ||   The Shaastras
        and Simritees implant the Naam within. The Gurmukh lives in peace
        and tranquility, doing deeds of sublime purity. The self-willed
        manmukh suffers the pains of reincarnation. His bonds are broken,
        enshrining the Name of the One Lord.  || 7 ||   Believing in the
        Naam, one obtains true honor and adoration. Who should I see?
        There is none other than the Lord. I see, and I say, that He alone
        is pleasing to my mind. <br>

        This mind feeds on virtue and vice. Intoxicated with the wine
        of Maya, satisfaction never comes. Satisfaction and liberation
        come, only to one whose mind is pleasing to the True Lord.  ||

        he is proud. But without the Name of the Lord, nothing shall go
        along with him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He enjoys tastes, pleasures
        and joys in his mind. But his wealth will pass on to other people,
        and his body will be reduced to ashes. The entire expanse, like
        dust, shall mix with dust. Without the Word of the Shabad, his
        filth is not removed.  || 2 ||   The various songs, tunes and
        rhythms are false. Trapped by the three qualities, people come
        and go, far from the Lord. In duality, the pain of their evil-mindedness
        does not leave them. But the Gurmukh is emancipated by taking
        the medicine, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  ||
        3 ||   He may wear a clean loin-cloth, apply the ceremonial mark
        to his forehead, and wear a mala around his neck; but if there
        is anger within him, he is merely reading his part, like an actor
        in a play. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he drinks
        in the wine of Maya. Without devotional worship to the Guru, there
        is no peace.  || 4 ||   The human is a pig, a dog, a donkey, a
        cat, a beast, a filthy, lowly wretch, an outcast, if he turns
        his face away from the Guru. He shall wander in reincarnation.
        Bound in bondage, he comes and goes.  || 5 ||   Serving the Guru,
        the treasure is found. With the Naam in the heart, one always
        prospers. And in the Court of the True Lord, you shall not called
        to account. One who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command,
        is approved at the Lord's Door.  || 6 ||   Meeting the
        True Guru, one knows the Lord. Understanding the Hukam of His
        Command, one acts according to His Will. Understanding the Hukam
        of His Command, he dwells in the Court of the True Lord. Through
        the Shabad, death and birth are ended.  || 7 ||   He remains detached,
        knowing that everything belongs to God. He dedicates his body
        and mind unto the One who owns them. He does not come, and he
        does not go. O Nanak, absorbed in Truth, he merges in the True
        Lord.  || 8 || 2 || <br>

        Naam shall dwell in your conscious mind. Meeting with the Guru,
        the Name of the Lord comes to mind. Without the Name, other loves
        are false.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So do that work, which the Guru
        tells you to do. Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, you shall
        come to the home of celestial bliss. Through the True Name, you
        shall obtain glorious greatness.  || 2 ||   One who does not understand

        a place of rest, in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence?

      <p> How can anyone hide anything from Him?  || 4 ||   The True Name
        is known through the True Word of the Shabad. The Lord Himself
        meets that one who eradicates egotistical pride. The Gurmukh chants
        the Naam, forever and ever.  || 5 ||   Serving the True Guru,
        duality and evil-mindedness are taken away. Guilty mistakes are
        erased, and the sinful intellect is cleansed. One's body
        sparkles like gold, and one's light merges into the Light.
        || 6 ||   Meeting with the True Guru, one is blessed with glorious
        greatness. Pain is taken away, and the Naam comes to dwell within
        the heart. Imbued with the Naam, one finds eternal peace.  ||
        7 ||   Obeying the Guru's Instructions, one finds the sate

        Love. The Gurmukh is inspired, his body is golden, and his light
        merges into the Light of the Fearless Lord.  || 1 ||   I take
        the Support of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. I cannot live,
        for a moment, even for an instant, without the Name of the Lord;
        the Gurmukh reads the Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   In the one house of the body, there are ten gates;
        night and day, the five thieves break in. They steal the entire
        wealth of one's Dharmic faith, but the blind, self-willed
        manmukh does not know it.  || 2 ||   The fortress of the body
        is overflowing with gold and jewels; when it is awakened by spiritual
        wisdom, one enshrines love for the essence of reality. The thieves
        and robbers hide out in the body; through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, they are arrested and locked up.  || 3 ||   The Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, is the boat, and the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad is the boatman, to carry us across. The Messenger of Death,
        the tax collector, does not even come close, and no thieves or
        robbers can plunder you.  || 4 ||   I continuously sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, day and night; singing the Lord's
        Praises, I cannot find His limits. The mind of the Gurmukh returns
        to its own home; it meets the Lord of the Universe, to the beat
        of the celestial drum.  || 5 ||   Gazing upon the Blessed Vision
        of His Darshan with my eyes, my mind is satisfied; with my ears,
        I listen to the Guru's Bani, and the Word of His Shabad.
        Listening, listening, my soul is softened, delighted by His subtle
        essence, chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe.  || 6
        ||   In the grip of the three qualities, they are engrossed in
        love and attachment to Maya; only as Gurmukh do they find the
        absolute quality, absorption in bliss. With a single, impartial
        eye, look upon all alike, and see God pervading all.  || 7 ||
        The Light of the Lord's Name permeates all; the Gurmukh
        knows the unknowable. O Nanak, the Lord has become merciful to
        the meek; through loving adoration, he merges in the Lord's
        Name.  || 8 || 1 || 4 ||   BILAAVAL,  FOURTH MEHL:  Meditate on
        the cool water of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Perfume yourself
        with the fragrant scent of the Lord, the sandalwood tree. <br>

      <p> Joining the Society of the Saints, I have obtained the supreme
        status. I am just a castor-oil tree, made fragrant by their association.
        || 1 ||   Meditate on the Lord of the Universe, the Master of
        the world, the Lord of creation. Those humble beings who seek
        the Lord's Sanctuary are saved, like Prahlaad; they are
        emancipated and merge with the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Of
        all plants, the sandalwood tree is the most sublime. Everything
        near the sandalwood tree becomes fragrant like sandalwood. The
        stubborn, false faithless cynics are dried up; their egotistical
        pride separates them far from the Lord.  || 2 ||   Only the Creator
        Lord Himself knows the state and condition of everyone; the Lord
        Himself makes all the arrangements. One who meets the True Guru
        is transformed into gold. Whatever is pre-ordained, is not erased
        by erasing.  || 3 ||   The treasure of jewels is found in the
        ocean of the Guru's Teachings. The treasure of devotional
        worship is opened to me. Focused on the Guru's Feet, faith
        wells up within me; chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        I hunger for more.  || 4 ||   I am totally detached, continually,
        continuously meditating on the Lord; chanting the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, I express my love for Him. Time and time again, each
        and every moment and instant, I express it. I cannot find the
        Lord's limits; He is the farthest of the far.  || 5 ||
        The Shaastras, the Vedas and the Puraanas advise righteous actions,
        and the performance of the six religious rituals. The hypocritical,
        self-willed manmukhs are ruined by doubt; in the waves of greed,
        their boat is heavily loaded, and it sinks.  || 6 ||   So chant
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and through the Naam, find emancipation.
        The Simritees and Shaastras recommend the Naam. Eradicating egotism,
        one becomes pure. The Gurmukh is inspired, and obtains the supreme
        status.  || 7 ||   This world, with its colors and forms, is all
        Yours, O Lord; as You attach us, so do we do our deeds. O Nanak,
        we are the instruments upon which He plays; as He wills, so is
        the path we take.  || 8 || 2 || 5 ||   BILAAVAL,  FOURTH MEHL:
        The Gurmukh meditates on the Inaccessible, Unfathomable Lord.
        I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the True Guru, the True Primal
        Being. He has brought the Lord's Name to dwell upon my
        breath of life; meeting with the True Guru, I am absorbed into
        the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   The Name of the Lord is the
        only Support of His humble servants. I shall live under the protection
        of the True Guru. By Guru's Grace, I shall attain the Court
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This body is the field of karma;
        the Gurmukhs plow and work it, and harvest the essence. The priceless
        jewel of the Naam becomes manifest, and it pours into their vessels
        of love.  || 2 ||   Become the slave of the slave of the slave,
        of that humble being who has become the devotee of the Lord. I
        dedicate my mind and intellect, and place them in offering before
        my Guru; by Guru's Grace, I speak the Unspoken.  || 3 ||
        The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in attachment to Maya;
        their minds are thirsty, burning with desire. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, I have obtained the Ambrosial Water of the Naam, and
        the fire has been put out. The Word of the Guru's Shabad
        has put it out.  || 4 ||   This mind dances before the True Guru. <br>

      <p> The unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds, vibrating the
        celestial melody. I praise the Lord, day and night, moving my
        feet to the beat of the drum.  || 5 ||   Imbued with the Lord's
        Love, my mind sings His Praise, joyfully chanting the Shabad,
        the source of nectar and bliss. The stream of immaculate purity
        flows through the home of the self within; one who drinks it in,
        finds peace.  || 6 ||   The stubborn-minded, egotistical, proud-minded
        person performs rituals, but these are like sand castles built
        by children. When the waves of the ocean come in, they crumble
        and dissolve in an instant.  || 7 ||   The Lord is the pool, and
        the Lord Himself is the ocean; this world is all a play which
        He has staged. As the waves of water merge into the water again,
        O Nanak, so does He merge into Himself.  || 8 || 3 || 6 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FOURTH MEHL:  My mind wears the ear-rings of the True Guru's
        acquaintance; I apply the ashes of the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad to my body. By body has become immortal, in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. Both birth and death have come to an
        end for me.  || 1 ||   O my mind, remain united with the Saadh
        Sangat. Be merciful to me, O Lord; each and every instant, let
        me wash the Feet of the Holy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Forsaking
        family life, he wanders in the forest, but his mind does not remain
        at rest, even for an instant. The wandering mind returns home,
        only when it seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Holy people.
        || 2 ||   The Sannyaasi renounces his daughters and sons, but
        his mind still conjures up all sorts of hopes and desires. With
        these hopes and desires, he still does not understand, that only
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad does one become free
        of desires, and find peace.  || 3 ||   When detachment from the
        world wells up within, he become a naked hermit, but still, his
        mind roams, wanders and rambles in the ten directions. He wanders
        around, but his desires are not satisfied; joining the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, he finds the house of kindness and compassion.
        || 4 ||   The Siddhas learn many Yogis postures, but their minds
        still yearn for riches, miraculous powers and energy. Satisfaction,
        contentment and tranquility do not come to their minds; but meeting
        the Holy Saints, they are satisfied, and through the Name of the
        Lord, spiritual perfection is attained.  || 5 ||   Life is born
        from the egg, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth; God
        created the beings and creatures of all colors and forms. One
        who seeks the Sanctuary of the Holy is saved, whether he is a
        Kh'shaatriya, a Brahmin, a Soodra, a Vaishya or the most
        untouchable of the untouchables.  || 6 ||   Naam Dayv, Jai Dayv,
        Kabeer, Trilochan and Ravi Daas the low-caste leather-worker,
        blessed Dhanna and Sain; all those who joined the humble Saadh
        Sangat, met the Merciful Lord.  || 7 ||   The Lord protects the
        honor of His humble servants; He is the Lover of His devotees
        - He makes them His own. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary
        of the Lord, the Life of the world, who has showered His Mercy
        upon him, and saved him.  || 8 ||  || 4 || 7 ||   BILAAVAL,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  The thirst for God has welled up deep within me; hearing
        the Word of the Guru's Teachings, my mind is pierced by

      <p> The pain of my mind is known only to my own mind; who can know
        the pain of another?  || 1 ||   The Lord, the Guru, the Enticer,
        has enticed my mind. I am stunned and amazed, gazing upon my Guru;
        I have entered the realm of wonder and bliss.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I wander around, exploring all lands and foreign countries;
        within my mind, I have such a great longing to see my God. I sacrifice
        my mind and body to the Guru, who has shown me the Way, the Path
        to my Lord God.  || 2 ||   If only someone would bring me news
        of God; He seems so sweet to my heart, mind and body. I would
        cut off my head and place it under the feet of that one who leads
        me to meet and unite with my Lord God.  || 3 ||   Let us go, O
        my companions, and understand our God; with the spell of virtue,
        let us obtain our Lord God. He is called the Lover of His devotees;
        let us follow in the footsteps of those who seek God's
        Sanctuary.  || 4 ||   If the soul-bride adorns herself with compassion
        and forgiveness, God is pleased, and her mind is illumined with
        the lamp of the Guru's wisdom. With happiness and ecstasy,
        my God enjoys her; I offer each and every bit of my soul to Him.
        || 5 ||   I have made the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, my necklace;
        my mind tinged with devotion is the intricate ornament of crowning
        glory. I have spread out my bed of faith in the Lord, Har, Har.
        I cannot abandon Him - my mind is filled with such a great
        love for Him.  || 6 ||   If God says one thing, and the soul-bride
        does something else, then all her decorations are useless and
        false. She may adorn herself to meet her Husband Lord, but still,
        only the virtuous soul-bride meets God, and the other's
        face is spat upon.  || 7 ||   I am Your hand-maiden, O Inaccessible
        Lord of the Universe; what can I do by myself? I am under Your
        power. Be merciful, Lord, to the meek, and save them; Nanak has
        entered the Sanctuary of the Lord, and the Guru.  || 8 || 5 ||
        8 ||   BILAAVAL,  FOURTH MEHL:  My mind and body are filled with
        love for my Inaccessible Lord and Master. Each and every instant,
        I am filled with immense faith and devotion. Gazing upon the Guru,
        my mind's faith is fulfilled, like the song-bird, which
        cries and cries, until the rain-drop falls into its mouth.  ||
        1 ||   Join with me, join with me, O my companions, and teach
        me the Sermon of the Lord. The True Guru has mercifully united
        me with God. Cutting off my head, and chopping it into pieces,
        I offer it to Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Each and every hair on
        my head, and my mind and body, suffer the pains of separation;
        without seeing my God, I cannot sleep. The doctors and healers
        look at me, and are perplexed. Within my heart, mind and body,
        I feel the pain of divine love.  || 2 ||   I cannot live for a
        moment, for even an instant, without my Beloved, like the opium
        addict who cannot live without opium. Those who thirst for God,
        do not love any other. Without the Lord, there is no other at
        all.  || 3 ||   If only someone would come and unite me with God;
        I am devoted, dedicated, a sacrifice to him. <br>

      <p> After being separated from the Lord for countless incarnations,
        I am re-united with Him, entering the Sanctuary of the True, True,
        True Guru.  || 4 ||   There is one bed for the soul-bride, and
        the same bed for God, her Lord and Master. The self-willed manmukh
        does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; she
        wanders around, in limbo. Uttering, &quot;Guru, Guru&quot;,
        she seeks His Sanctuary; so God comes to meet her, without a moment's
        delay.  || 5 ||   One may perform many rituals, but the mind is
        filled with hypocrisy, evil deeds and greed. When a son is born
        in the house of a prostitute, who can tell the name of his father?
        || 6 ||   Because of devotional worship in my past incarnations,
        I have been born into this life. The Guru has inspired me to worship
        the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. Worshipping, worshipping Him with
        devotion, I found the Lord, and then I merged into the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har.  || 7 ||   God Himself came and
        ground the henna leaves into powder, and applied it to my body.
        Our Lord and Master showers His Mercy upon us, and grasps hold
        of our arms; O Nanak, He lifts us up and saves us.  || 8 || 6

      <p> <font color="#000000">I cannot express the Praises of my God; I
        cannot express His Praises. I have abandoned all others, seeking
        His Sanctuary.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God's Lotus Feet are
        Infinite. I am forever a sacrifice to Them. My mind is in love
        with Them. If I were to abandon Them, there is nowhere else I
        could go.  || 1 ||   I chant the Lord's Name with my tongue.
        The filth of my sins and evil mistakes is burnt off. Climbing
        aboard the Boat of the Saints, I am emancipated. I have been carried
        across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 2 ||   My mind is tied
        to the Lord with the string of love and devotion. This is the
        Immaculate Way of the Saints. They forsake sin and corruption.
        They meet the Formless Lord God.  || 3 ||   Gazing upon God, I
        am wonderstruck. I taste the Perfect Flavor of Bliss. I do not
        waver or wander here or there. The Lord God, Har, Har, dwells
        within my consciousness.  || 4 ||   Those who constantly remember
        God, the treasure of virtue, will never go to hell. Those who
        listen, fascinated, to the Unstruck Sound-Current of the Word,
        will never have to see the Messenger of Death with their eyes.
        || 5 ||   I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Heroic Lord of
        the World. The Merciful Lord God is under the power of His devotees.
        The Vedas do not know the Mystery of the Lord. The silent sages
        constantly serve Him.  || 6 ||   He is the Destroyer of the pains
        and sorrows of the poor. It is so very difficult to serve Him.
        No one knows His limits. He is pervading the water, the land and
        the sky.  || 7 ||   Hundreds of thousands of times, I humbly bow
        to Him. I have grown weary, and I have collapsed at God's
        Door. O God, make me the dust of the feet of the Holy. Please
        fulfill this, Nanak's wish.  || 8 || 1 ||   BILAAVAL, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  God, please release me from birth and death. I have
        grown weary, and collapsed at Your door. I grasp Your Feet, in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. The Love of the Lord,
        Har, Har, is sweet to my mind. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Be Merciful, and attach me to the hem of Your robe. Nanak meditates
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Merciful Master
        of the meek, You are my Lord and Master, O Merciful Master of
        the meek. I yearn for the dust of the feet of the Saints.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The world is a pit of poison, filled with the
        utter darkness of ignorance and emotional attachment. Please take
        my hand, and save me, Dear God. Please bless me with Your Name,
        Lord. Without You, God, I have no place at all. Nanak is a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice to You.  || 2 ||   The human body is in the grip of
        greed and attachment. Without meditating and vibrating upon the
        Lord, it is reduced to ashes. The Messenger of Death is dreadful
        and horrible. The recording scribes of the conscious and the unconscious,
        Chitr and Gupt, know all actions and karma. Day and night, they
        bear witness. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord.  || 3 ||
        O Lord, Destroyer of fear and egotism, be merciful, and save
        the sinners. My sins cannot even be counted. Without the Lord,
        who can hide them? I thought of Your Support, and seized it, O
        my Lord and Master. Please, give Nanak Your hand and save him,
        Lord!  || 4 ||   The Lord, the treasure of virtue, the Lord of
        the world, cherishes and and sustains every heart. My mind is
        thirsty for Your Love, and the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
        O Lord of the Universe, please fulfill my hopes. I cannot survive,
        even for an instant. By great good fortune, Nanak has found the
        Lord.  || 5 ||   Without You, God, there is no other at all. My
        mind loves You, as the partridge loves the moon, as the fish loves
        the water, as the bee and the lotus cannot be separated. As the
        chakvi bird longs for the sun, so does Nanak thirst for the Lord's
        feet.  || 6 ||   As the young bride places the hopes of her life
        in her husband, as the greedy person looks upon the gift of wealth,
        as milk is joined to water, as food is to the very hungry man,
        and as the mother loves her son, so does Nanak constantly remember
        the Lord in meditation.  || 7 ||   As the moth falls into the
        lamp, as the thief steals without hesitation, as the elephant
        is trapped by its sexual urges, as the sinner is caught in his
        sins, as the gambler's addiction does not leave him, so
        is this mind of Nanak's attached to the Lord.  || 8 ||
        As the deer loves the sound of the bell, and as the song-bird
        longs for the rain, the Lord's humble servant lives in
        the Society of the Saints, lovingly meditating and vibrating upon
        the Lord of the Universe. My tongue chants the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. Please bless Nanak with the gift of the Blessed Vision
        of Your Darshan.  || 9 ||   One who sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, and hears them, and writes them, receives all fruits
        and rewards from the Lord. He saves all his ancestors and generations,
        and crosses over the world-ocean. The Lord's Feet are the
        boat to carry him across. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, he sings the Praises of the Lord. The Lord protects
        his honor. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's door.
