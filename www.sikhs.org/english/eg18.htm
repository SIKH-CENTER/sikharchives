      <p> Please bless Nanak with the dust of the feet of the Holy.  ||
        4 || 75 || 144 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  They wear and eat the
        gifts from the Lord; how can laziness help them, O mother?  ||
        1 ||   Forgetting her Husband Lord, and attaching herself to other
        affairs, the soul-bride throws away the precious jewel in exchange
        for a mere shell.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Forsaking God, she is
        attached to other desires. But who has gained honor by saluting
        the slave?  || 2 ||   They consume food and drink, delicious and
        sublime as ambrosial nectar. But the dog does not know the One
        who has bestowed these.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, I have been unfaithful
        to my own nature. Please forgive me, O God, O Searcher of hearts.
        || 4 || 76 || 145 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I meditate on the
        Feet of God within my mind. This is my cleansing bath at all the
        sacred shrines of pilgrimage.  || 1 ||   Meditate in remembrance
        on the Lord every day, O my Siblings of Destiny. Thus, the filth
        of millions of incarnations shall be taken away.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Enshrine the Lord's Sermon within your heart, and you
        shall obtain all the desires of your mind.  || 2 ||   Redeemed
        is the life, death and birth of those, within whose hearts the
        Lord God abides.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, those humble beings are
        perfect, who are blessed with the dust of the feet of the Holy.
        || 4 || 77 || 146 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  They eat and wear
        what they are given, but still, they deny the Lord. The messengers
        of the Righteous Judge of Dharma shall hunt them down.  || 1 ||
        They are unfaithful to the One, who has given them body and
        soul. Through millions of incarnations, for so many lifetimes,
        they wander lost.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Such is the lifestyle
        of the faithless cynics; everything they do is evil.  || 2 ||
        Within their minds, they have forgotten that Lord and Master,
        who created the soul, breath of life, mind and body.  || 3 ||
        Their wickedness and corruption have increased  -  they are
        recorded in volumes of books. O Nanak, they are saved only by
        the Mercy of God, the Ocean of peace.  || 4 ||   O Supreme Lord
        God, I have come to Your Sanctuary. Break my bonds, and carry
        me across, with the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Second Pause 
        || 78 || 147 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  For their own advantage,
        they make God their friend. He fulfills all their desires, and
        blesses them with the state of liberation.  || 1 ||   Everyone
        should make Him such a friend. No one goes away empty-handed from
        Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   For their own purposes, they enshrine
        the Lord in the heart; all pain, suffering and disease are taken
        away.  || 2 ||   Their tongues learn the habit of chanting the
        Lord's Name, and all their works are brought to perfection.
        || 3 ||   So many times, Nanak is a sacrifice to Him; fruitful
        is the Blessed Vision, the Darshan, of my Lord of the Universe.
        || 4 || 79 || 148 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Millions of obstacles
        are removed in an instant, for those who listen to the Sermon
        of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy.  || 1 ||   They drink in the sublime essence of the Lord's
        Name, the Ambrosial Elixir. Meditating on the Lord's Feet,
        hunger is taken away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The treasure of all
        happiness, celestial peace and poise, are obtained by those, whose
        hearts are filled with the Lord God. </p>

      <p> || 2 ||   All medicines and remedies, mantras and tantras are
        nothing more than ashes. Enshrine the Creator Lord within your
        heart.  || 3 ||   Renounce all your doubts, and vibrate upon the
        Supreme Lord God. Says Nanak, this path of Dharma is eternal and
        unchanging.  || 4 || 80 || 149 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        Lord bestowed His Mercy, and led me to meet the Guru. By His power,
        no disease afflicts me.  || 1 ||   Remembering the Lord, I cross
        over the terrifying world-ocean. In the Sanctuary of the spiritual
        warrior, the account books of the Messenger of Death are torn
        up.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The True Guru has given me the Mantra
        of the Lord's Name. By this Support, my affairs have been
        resolved.  || 2 ||   Meditation, self-discipline, self-control
        and perfect greatness were obtained when the Merciful Lord, the
        Guru, became my Help and Support.  || 3 ||   The Guru has dispelled
        pride, emotional attachment and superstition. Nanak sees the Supreme
        Lord God pervading everywhere.  || 4 || 81 || 150 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The blind beggar is better off than the vicious
        king. Overcome by pain, the blind man invokes the Lord's
        Name.  || 1 ||   You are the glorious greatness of Your slave.
        The intoxication of Maya leads the others to hell.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Gripped by disease, they invoke the Name. But those who
        are intoxicated with vice shall find no home, no place of rest.
        || 2 ||   One who is in love with the Lord's Lotus Feet,
        does not think of any other comforts.  || 3 ||   Forever and ever,
        meditate on God, your Lord and Master. O Nanak, meet with the
        Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.  || 4 || 82 ||
        151 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Twenty-four hours a day, the highway
        robbers are my companions. Granting His Grace, God has driven
        them away.  || 1 ||   Everyone should dwell on the Sweet Name
        of such a Lord. God is overflowing with all power.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The world-ocean is burning hot! In an instant, God saves
        us, and carries us across.  || 2 ||   There are so many bonds,
        they cannot be broken. Remembering the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        the fruit of liberation is obtained.  || 3 ||   By clever devices,
        nothing is accomplished. Grant Your Grace to Nanak, that he may
        sing the Glories of God.  || 4 || 83 || 152 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Those who obtain the wealth of the Lord's Name move
        freely in the world; all their affairs are resolved.  || 1 ||
        By great good fortune, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises
        are sung. O Supreme Lord God, as You give, so do I receive.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Enshrine the Lord's Feet within your heart.
        Get aboard this boat, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
        || 2 ||   Everyone who joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, obtains eternal peace; pain does not afflict them any
        longer.  || 3 ||  With loving devotional worship, meditate on
        the treasure of excellence. O Nanak, you shall be honored in the
        Court of the Lord.  || 4 || 84 || 153 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Lord, our Friend, is totally pervading the water, the land
        and the skies. Doubts are dispelled by continually singing the
        Lord's Glorious Praises.  || 1 ||   While rising up, and
        while lying down in sleep, the Lord is always with you, watching
        over you. Remembering Him in meditation, the fear of Death departs.
        || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> With God's Lotus Feet abiding in the heart, all suffering
        comes to an end.  || 2 ||   The One Lord is my hope, honor, power
        and wealth. Within my mind is the Support of the True Banker.
        || 3 ||   I am the poorest and most helpless servant of the Holy.
        O Nanak, giving me His Hand, God has protected me.  || 4 || 85
        || 154 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Taking my cleansing bath in
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have been purified. Its reward
        surpasses the giving of charity at millions of solar eclipses.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   With the Lord's Feet abiding in the
        heart, the sinful mistakes of countless incarnations are removed.
        || 1 ||   I have obtained the reward of the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. I no longer
        have to gaze upon the way of death.  || 2 ||   In thought, word
        and deed, seek the Support of the Lord of the Universe; thus you
        shall be saved from the poisonous world-ocean.  || 3 ||   Granting
        His Grace, God has made me His Own. Nanak chants and meditates
        on the Chant of the Lord's Name.  || 4 || 86 || 155 ||  
        GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Seek the Sanctuary of those who have come
        to know the Lord. Your mind and body shall become cool and peaceful,
        imbued with the Feet of the Lord.  || 1 ||   If God, the Destroyer
        of fear, does not dwell within your mind, you shall spend countless
        incarnations in fear and dread.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who
        have the Lord's Name dwelling within their hearts have all
        their desires and tasks fulfilled.  || 2 ||   Birth, old age and
        death are in His Power, so remember that All-powerful Lord with
        each breath and morsel of food.  || 3 ||   The One God is my Intimate,
        Best Friend and Companion. The Naam, the Name of my Lord and Master,
        is Nanak's only Support.  || 4 || 87 || 156 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  When they are out and about, they keep Him enshrined
        in their hearts; returning home, the Lord of the Universe is still
        with them.  || 1 ||   The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the Companion
        of His Saints. Their minds and bodies are imbued with the Love
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By Guru's Grace, one crosses
        over the world-ocean; the sinful mistakes of countless incarnations
        are all washed away.  || 2 ||   Honor and intuitive awareness
        are acquired through the Name of the Lord God. The Teachings of
        the Perfect Guru are immaculate and pure.  || 3 ||   Within your
        heart, meditate on the His Lotus Feet. Nanak lives by beholding
        the Lord's Expansive Power.  || 4 || 88 || 157 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Blessed is this place, where the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord of the Universe are sung. God Himself bestows peace
        and pleasure.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Misfortune occurs where the
        Lord is not remembered in meditation. There are millions of joys
        where the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung.  || 1 ||   Forgetting
        the Lord, all sorts of pains and diseases come. Serving God, the
        Messenger of Death will not even approach you.  || 2 ||   Very
        blessed, stable and sublime is that place, where the Name of God
        alone is chanted.  || 3 ||   Wherever I go, my Lord and Master
        is with me. Nanak has met the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
        || 4 || 89 || 158 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  That mortal who
        meditates on the Lord of the Universe, whether educated or uneducated,
        obtains the state of supreme dignity.  || 1 ||   In the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on the Lord of the World.
        Without the Name, wealth and property are false.  || 1 ||  Pause

      <p> They alone are handsome, clever and wise, who surrender to the
        Will of God.  || 2 ||   Blessed is their coming into this world,
        if they recognize their Lord and Master in each and every heart.
        || 3 ||   Says Nanak, their good fortune is perfect, if they
        enshrine the Lord's Feet within their minds.  || 4 || 90
        || 159 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord's servant does
        not associate with the faithless cynic. One is in the clutches
        of vice, while the other is in love with the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   It would be like an imaginary rider on a decorated horse,
        or a eunuch caressing a woman.  || 1 ||   It would be like tying
        up an ox and trying to milk it, or riding a cow to chase a tiger.
        || 2 ||   It would be like taking a sheep and worshipping it
        as the Elysian cow, the giver of all blessings; it would be like
        going out shopping without any money.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, consciously
        meditate on the Lord's Name. Meditate in remembrance on the
        Lord Master, your Best Friend.  || 4 || 91 || 160 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Pure and steady is that intellect, which drinks
        in the Lord's sublime essence.  || 1 ||   Keep the Support
        of the Lord's Feet in your heart, and you shall be saved
        from the cycle of birth and death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Pure
        is that body, in which sin does not arise. In the Love of the
        Lord is pure glory.  || 2 ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, corruption is eradicated. This is the greatest blessing
        of all.  || 3 ||   Imbued with loving devotional worship of the
        Sustainer of the Universe, Nanak asks for the dust of the feet
        of the Holy.  || 4 || 92 || 161 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Such
        is my love for the Lord of the Universe; through perfect good
        destiny, I have been united with Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As
        the wife is delighted upon beholding her husband, so does the
        Lord's humble servant live by chanting the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||   As the mother is rejuvenated upon seeing
        her son, so is the Lord's humble servant imbued with Him,
        through and through.  || 2 ||   As the greedy man rejoices upon
        beholding his wealth, so is the mind of the Lord's humble
        servant attached to His Lotus Feet.  || 3 ||   May I never forget
        You, for even an instant, O Great Giver! Nanak's God is the
        Support of his breath of life.  || 4 || 93 || 162 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Those humble beings who are accustomed to the Lord's
        sublime essence, are pierced through with loving devotional worship
        of the Lord's Lotus Feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All other
        pleasures look like ashes; without the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        the world is fruitless.  || 1 ||   He Himself rescues us from
        the deep dark well. Wondrous and Glorious are the Praises of the
        Lord of the Universe.  || 2 ||   In the woods and meadows, and
        throughout the three worlds, the Sustainer of the Universe is
        pervading. The Expansive Lord God is Merciful to all beings. 
        || 3 ||   Says Nanak, that speech alone is excellent, which is
        approved by the Creator Lord.  || 4 || 94 || 163 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Every day, take your bath in the Sacred Pool of
        the Lord. Mix and drink in the most delicious, sublime Ambrosial
        Nectar of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The water of the Name
        of the Lord of the Universe is immaculate and pure. </p>

      <p> Take your cleansing bath in it, and all your affairs shall be
        resolved.  || 1 ||   In the Society of the Saints, spiritual conversations
        take place. The sinful mistakes of millions of incarnations are
        erased.  || 2 ||   The Holy Saints meditate in remembrance, in
        ecstasy. Their minds and bodies are immersed in supreme ecstasy.
        || 3 ||   Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to those who have obtained
        the treasure of the Lord's Feet.  || 4 || 95 || 164 ||  
        GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Do only that, by which no filth or pollution
        shall stick to you. Let your mind remain awake and aware, singing
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate
        in remembrance on the One Lord; do not be in love with duality.
        In the Society of the Saints, chant only the Name.  || 1 ||  
        The karma of good actions, the Dharma of righteous living, religious
        rituals, fasts and worship  -  practice these, but do not know
        any other than the Supreme Lord God.  || 2 ||   Those who place
        their love in God  -  their works are brought to fruition.
        || 3 ||   Infinitely invaluable is that Vaishnaav, that worshipper
        of Vishnu, says Nanak, who has renounced corruption.  || 4 ||
        96 || 165 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  They desert you even when
        you are alive, O madman; what good can they do when someone is
        dead?  || 1 ||   Meditate in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe
        in your mind and body  -  this is your pre-ordained destiny.
        The poison of Maya is of no use at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        Those who have eaten this poison of deception  -  their thirst
        shall never depart.  || 2 ||   The treacherous world-ocean is
        filled with terrible pain. Without the Lord's Name, how can
        anyone cross over?  || 3 ||   Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, you shall be saved here and hereafter. O Nanak, worship
        and adore the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 97 || 166 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The bearded emperor who struck down the poor, has
        been burnt in the fire by the Supreme Lord God.  || 1 ||   The
        Creator administers true justice. He is the Saving Grace of His
        slaves.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the beginning, and throughout
        the ages, His glory is manifest. The slanderer died after contracting
        the deadly fever.  || 2 ||   He is killed, and no one can save
        him. Here and hereafter, his reputation is evil.  || 3 ||   The
        Lord hugs His slaves close in His Embrace. Nanak seeks the Lord's
        Sanctuary, and meditates on the Naam.  || 4 || 98 || 167 ||  
        GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The memorandum was proven to be false by
        the Lord Himself. The sinner is now suffering in despair.  ||
        1 ||   Those who have my Lord of the Universe as their support
        -  death does not even approach them.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        In the True Court, they lie; the blind fools strike their own
        heads with their own hands.  || 2 ||   Sickness afflicts those
        who commit sins; God Himself sits as the Judge.  || 3 ||   By
        their own actions, they are bound and gagged. All their wealth
        is gone, along with their lives.  || 4 ||   Nanak has taken to
        the Sanctuary of the Lord's Court; my Creator has preserved
        my honor.  || 5 || 99 || 168 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The dust
        of the feet of the humble beings is so sweet to my mind. Perfect

      <p> The mind is overflowing with the greasy dirt of egotistical pride.
        With the dust of the feet of the Holy, it is scrubbed clean. 
        || 1 ||   The body may be washed with loads of water, and yet
        its filth is not removed, and it does not become clean.  || 2
        ||   I have met the True Guru, who is merciful forever. Meditating,
        meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I am rid of the fear of
        death.  || 3 ||   Liberation, pleasures and worldly success are
        all in the Lord's Name. With loving devotional worship, O
        Nanak, sing His Glorious Praises.  || 4 || 100 || 169 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord's slaves attain the highest status
        of life. Meeting them, the soul is enlightened.  || 1 ||   Those
        who listen with their mind and ears to the Lord's meditative
        remembrance, are blessed with peace at the Lord's Gate, O

        GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Peace and tranquility have come; the Guru,

        the Company of the Holy, you shall be emancipated.  || 2 ||

        be dispelled, and you shall be saved, my humble friend.  || 3

        The Giver of joy has saved him from smallpox. The Supreme Lord
        God has granted His Grace.  || 1 ||   O Nanak, he alone lives,
        who chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, drink deeply of the Lord's Ambrosial
        Nectar.  || 2 || 103 || 172 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Blessed
        is that forehead, and blessed are those eyes; blessed are those
        devotees who are in love with You.  || 1 ||   Without the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, how anyone find peace? With your tongue,
        chant the Praises of the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Nanak is a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Lord of Nirvaanaa.
        || 2 || 104 || 173 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are my Advisor;
        You are always with me. You preserve, protect and care for me.
        || 1 ||   Such is the Lord, our Help and Support in this world
        and the next. He protects the honor of His slave, O my Sibling
        of Destiny.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He alone exists hereafter; this
        place is in His Power. Twenty-four hours a day, O my mind, chant

        and he bears the True Insignia; the Lord Himself issues His Royal
        Command.  || 3 ||   He Himself is the Giver; He Himself is the
        Cherisher. Continually, continuously, O Nanak, dwell upon the
        Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 105 || 174 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        When the Perfect True Guru becomes merciful, the Lord of the
        World abides in the heart forever.  || 1 || </p>

        it out beneath him. Like a donkey, he gulps down all that comes
        his way.  || 1 ||   Without good deeds, liberation is not obtained.
        The wealth of liberation is only obtained by meditating on the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He performs
        worship ceremonies, applies the ceremonial tilak mark to his forehead,
        and takes his ritual cleansing baths; he pulls out his knife,
        and demands donations.  || 2 ||   With his mouth, he recites the
        Vedas in sweet musical measures, and yet he does not hesitate
        to take the lives of others.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, when God showers
        His Mercy, even his heart becomes pure, and he contemplates God.
        || 4 || 107 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Remain steady in the home
        of your own self, O beloved servant of the Lord. The True Guru
        shall resolve all your affairs.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Transcendent
        Lord has struck down the wicked and the evil. The Creator has
        preserved the honor of His servant.  || 1 ||   The kings and emperors
        are all under his power; he drinks deeply of the most sublime
        essence of the Ambrosial Naam.  || 2 ||   Meditate fearlessly
        on the Lord God. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, this gift is given.  || 3 ||   Nanak has entered the Sanctuary
        of God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; he grasps the
        Support of God, his Lord and Master.  || 4 || 108 ||   GAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  One who is attuned to the Lord, shall not be burned
        in the fire. One who is attuned to the Lord, shall not be enticed
        by Maya. One who is attuned to the Lord, shall not be drowned
        in water. One who is attuned to the Lord, is prosperous and fruitful.
        || 1 ||   All fear is eradicated by Your Name. Joining the Sangat,
        the Holy Congregation, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who is attuned to the Lord,
        is free of all anxieties. One who is attuned to the Lord, is blessed
        with the Mantra of the Holy. One who is attuned to the Lord, is
        not haunted by the fear of death. One who is attuned to the Lord,
        sees all his hopes fulfilled.  || 2 ||   One who is attuned to
        the Lord, does not suffer in pain. One who is attuned to the Lord,
        remains awake and aware, night and day. One who is attuned to
        the Lord, dwells in the home of intuitive peace. One who is attuned
        to the Lord, sees his doubts and fears run away.  || 3 ||   One
        who is attuned to the Lord, has the most sublime and exalted intellect.
        One who is attuned to the Lord, has a pure and spotless reputation.
        Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who do not forget my God.
        || 4 || 109 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Through sincere efforts,
        the mind is made peaceful and calm. Walking on the Lord's
        Way, all pains are taken away. Chanting the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, the mind becomes blissful. Singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, supreme bliss is obtained.  || 1 ||   There is joy
        all around, and peace has come to my home. Joining the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, misfortune disappears.  || 1 ||  Pause

        he has desired, then where should he go to look for Him? I have

        || 110 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The merits of taking millions
        of ceremonial cleansing baths, the giving of hundreds of thousands,
        billions and trillions in charity  -  these are obtained by
        those whose minds are filled with the Name of the Lord.  || 1
        ||   Those who sing the Glories of the Lord of the World are totally
        pure. Their sins are erased, in the Sanctuary of the Kind and

        sorts of austere acts of penance and self-discipline, earning
        huge profits and seeing one's desires fulfilled  -  these
        are obtained by chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with
        the tongue.  || 2 ||   The merits of reciting the Simritees, the
        Shaastras and the Vedas, knowledge of the science of Yoga, spiritual
        wisdom and the pleasure of miraculous spiritual powers  - 
        these come by surrendering the mind and meditating on the Name
        of God.  || 3 ||   The wisdom of the Inaccessible and Infinite
        Lord is incomprehensible. Meditating on the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, and contemplating the Naam within our hearts, O Nanak,
        God has showered His Mercy upon us.  || 4 || 111 ||   GAUREE,

        I have found peace. I have enshrined the Lotus Feet of the Guru
        within my heart.  || 1 ||   The Guru, the Lord of the Universe,
        the Supreme Lord God, is perfect. Worshipping Him, my mind has
        found a lasting peace.  ||  Pause  ||   Night and day, I meditate
        on the Guru, and the Name of the Guru. Thus all my works are brought
        to perfection.  || 2 ||   Beholding the Blessed Vision of His
        Darshan, my mind has become cool and tranquil, and the sinful
        mistakes of countless incarnations have been washed away.  ||
        3 ||   Says Nanak, where is fear now, O Siblings of Destiny? The
        Guru Himself has preserved the honor of His servant.  || 4 ||

        Support of His servants. He always cherishes them, like their
        father and mother.  || 1 ||   In God's Sanctuary, everyone
        is saved. That Perfect True Lord is the Doer, the Cause of causes.
        ||  Pause  ||   My mind now dwells in the Creator Lord. My fears
        have been dispelled, and my soul has found the most sublime peace.
        || 2 ||   The Lord has granted His Grace, and saved His humble
        servant. The sinful mistakes of so many incarnations have been
        washed away.  || 3 ||   The Greatness of God cannot be described.

        various articles; just so, the Lord has made the many patterns
        of the creation. Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt;
        in this way, my essence merges into God's essence.  || 4
        || 2 || 123 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  This life is diminishing,
        day and night. Meeting with the Guru, your affairs shall be resolved.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Listen, my friends, I beg of you: now is
        the time to serve the Saints! In this world, earn the profit of
        the Lord's Name, and hereafter, you shall dwell in peace.
        || 1 ||   This world is engrossed in corruption and cynicism.
        Only those who know God are saved. Those who are awakened by the
        Lord to drink in this sublime essence, come to know the Unspoken
        Speech of the Lord.  || 2 ||   Purchase only that for which you
        have come into the world, and through the Guru, the Lord shall
        dwell within your mind. Within the home of your own inner being,
        you shall obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence with
        intuitive ease. You shall not be consigned again to the wheel
        of reincarnation.  || 3 ||   O Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts,
        Primal Being, Architect of Destiny: please fulfill this yearning
        of my mind. Nanak, Your slave, begs for this happiness: let me
        be the dust of the feet of the Saints.  || 4 || 3 || 124 ||  
        GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Save me, O My Father God. I am worthless
        and without virtue; all virtues are Yours.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The five vicious thieves are assaulting my poor being; save
        me, O Savior Lord! <br>
