      <p> Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, search this cave.
        The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within
        the self. Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and decorate
        yourself with the Shabad. Meeting with your Beloved, you shall
        find peace.  || 4 ||   The Messenger of Death imposes his tax
        on those who are attached to duality. He inflicts punishment on
        those who forget the Name. They are called to account for each
        instant and each moment. Every grain, every particle, is weighed
        and counted.  || 5 ||   One who does not remember her Husband
        Lord in this world is being cheated by duality; she shall weep
        bitterly in the end. She is from an evil family; she is ugly and
        vile. Even in her dreams, she does not meet her Husband Lord.
        || 6 ||   She who enshrines her Husband Lord in her mind in this
        world - His Presence is revealed to her by the Perfect Guru.
        That soul-bride keeps her Husband Lord clasped tightly to her
        heart, and through the Word of the Shabad, she enjoys her Husband
        Lord upon His Beautiful Bed.  || 7 ||   The Lord Himself sends
        out the call, and He summons us to His Presence. He enshrines
        His Name within our minds. O Nanak, one who receives the greatness
        of the Naam night and day, constantly sings His Glorious Praises.
        || 8 || 28 || 29 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  Sublime is their birth,
        and the place where they dwell. Those who serve the True Guru
        remain detached in the home of their own being. They abide in
        the Lord's Love, and constantly imbued with His Love, their
        minds are satisfied and fulfilled with the Lord's Essence.
        || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those
        who read of the Lord, who understand and enshrine Him within their
        minds. The Gurmukhs read and praise the Lord's Name; they
        are honored in the True Court.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Unseen
        and Inscrutable Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere. He
        cannot be obtained by any effort. If the Lord grants His Grace,
        then we come to meet the True Guru. By His Kindness, we are united
        in His Union.  || 2 ||   One who reads, while attached to duality,
        does not understand. He yearns for the three-phased Maya. The
        bonds of the three-phased Maya are broken by the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. Through the Guru's Shabad, liberation is achieved.
        || 3 ||   This unstable mind cannot be held steady. Attached
        to duality, it wanders in the ten directions. It is a poisonous
        worm, drenched with poison, and in poison it rots away.  || 4
        ||   Practicing egotism and selfishness, they try to impress others
        by showing off. They perform all sorts of rituals, but they gain
        no acceptance. Without You, Lord, nothing happens at all. You
        forgive those who are adorned with the Word of Your Shabad.  ||
        5 ||   They are born, and they die, but they do not understand
        the Lord. Night and day, they wander, in love with duality. The
        lives of the self-willed manmukhs are useless; in the end, they
        die, regretting and repenting.  || 6 ||   The Husband is away,
        and the wife is getting dressed up. This is what the blind, self-willed
        manmukhs are doing. They are not honored in this world, and they
        shall find no shelter in the world hereafter. They are wasting
        their lives in vain.  || 7 ||   How rare are those who know the
        Name of the Lord! Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect
        Guru, the Lord is realized. Night and day, they perform the Lord's
        devotional service; day and night, they find intuitive peace.
        || 8 ||   That One Lord is pervading in all. Only a few, as Gurmukh,
        understand this. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are
        beautiful. </p>

      <p> Granting His Grace, God unites them with Himself.  || 9 || 29
        || 30 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukhs read
        and recite; they are called Pandits - spiritual scholars. But
        they are in love with duality, and they suffer in terrible pain.
        Intoxicated with vice, they understand nothing at all. They are
        reincarnated, over and over again.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        my soul is a sacrifice, to those who subdue their ego, and unite
        with the Lord. They serve the Guru, and the Lord dwells within
        their minds; they intuitively drink in the sublime essence of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Pandits read the Vedas, but
        they do not obtain the Lord's essence. Intoxicated with Maya,
        they argue and debate. The foolish intellectuals are forever in
        spiritual darkness. The Gurmukhs understand, and sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord.  || 2 ||   The Indescribable is described
        only through the beauteous Word of the Shabad. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, the Truth becomes pleasing to the mind. Those who speak
        of the truest of the true, day and night - their minds are
        imbued with the Truth.  || 3 ||   Those who are attuned to Truth,
        love the Truth. The Lord Himself bestows this gift; He shall not
        take it back. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the
        True Lord is known forever; meeting the True One, peace is found.
        || 4 ||   The filth of fraud and falsehood does not stick to
        those who, by Guru's Grace, remain awake and aware, night
        and day. The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep
        within their hearts; their light merges into the Light.  || 5
        ||   They read about the three qualities, but they do not know
        the essential reality of the Lord. They forget the Primal Lord,
        the Source of all, and they do not recognize the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. They are engrossed in emotional attachment; they do not
        understand anything at all. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, the Lord is found.  || 6 ||   The Vedas proclaim that
        Maya is of three qualities. The self-willed manmukhs, in love
        with duality, do not understand. They read of the three qualities,
        but they do not know the One Lord. Without understanding, they
        obtain only pain and suffering.  || 7 ||   When it pleases the
        Lord, He unites us with Himself. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, skepticism and suffering are dispelled. O Nanak, True
        is the Greatness of the Name. Believing in the Name, peace is
        obtained.  || 8 || 30 || 31 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The Lord
        Himself is Unmanifest and Unrelated; He is Manifest and Related
        as well. Those who recognize this essential reality are the true
        Pandits, the spiritual scholars. They save themselves, and save
        all their families and ancestors as well, when they enshrine the
        Lord's Name in the mind.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my
        soul is a sacrifice, to those who taste the essence of the Lord,
        and savor its taste. Those who taste this essence of the Lord
        are the pure, immaculate beings. They meditate on the Immaculate
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who reflect
        upon the Shabad are beyond karma. They subdue their ego, and find
        the essence of wisdom, deep within their being. They obtain the
        nine treasures of the wealth of the Naam. Rising above the three
        qualities, they merge into the Lord.  || 2 ||   Those who act
        in ego do not go beyond karma. It is only by Guru's Grace
        that one is rid of ego. Those who have discriminating minds, continually
        examine their own selves. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, they sing the Lord's Glorious Praises.  || 3 || 
        The Lord is the most pure and sublime Ocean. The Saintly Gurmukhs
        continually peck at the Naam, like swans pecking at pearls in
        the ocean. They bathe in it continually, day and night, and the
        filth of ego is washed away.  || 4 ||   The pure swans, with love
        and affection, dwell in the Ocean of the Lord, and subdue their
        ego. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Day and night, they are in love with the True Word of the Shabad.
        They obtain their home in the Ocean of the Lord.  || 5 ||   The
        self-willed manmukhs shall always be filthy cranes, smeared with
        the filth of ego. They may bathe, but their filth is not removed.
        One who dies while yet alive, and contemplates the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, is rid of this filth of ego.  || 6 ||   The
        Priceless Jewel is found, in the home of one's own being,
        when one listens to the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect True Guru.
        By Guru's Grace, the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled;
        I have come to recognize the Divine Light within my own heart.
        || 7 ||   The Lord Himself creates, and He Himself beholds. Serving
        the True Guru, one becomes acceptable. O Nanak, the Naam dwells
        deep within the heart; by Guru's Grace, it is obtained. 
        || 8 || 31 || 32 ||   MAAJH,  THIRD MEHL:  The whole world is
        engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya. Those who are controlled
        by the three qualities are attached to Maya. By Guru's Grace,
        a few come to understand; they center their consciousness in the
        fourth state.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice,
        to those who burn away their emotional attachment to Maya, through
        the Shabad. Those who burn away this attachment to Maya, and focus
        their consciousness on the Lord are honored in the True Court,
        and the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   The source, the root, of the gods and goddesses is Maya.
        For them, the Simritees and the Shaastras were composed. Sexual
        desire and anger are diffused throughout the universe. Coming
        and going, people suffer in pain.  || 2 ||   The jewel of spiritual
        wisdom was placed within the universe. By Guru's Grace, it
        is enshrined within the mind. Celibacy, chastity, self-discipline
        and the practice of truthfulness are obtained from the Perfect
        Guru, by meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||
        In this world of her parents' home, the soul-bride has
        been deluded by doubt. Attached to duality, she later comes to
        regret it. She forfeits both this world and the next, and even
        in her dreams, she does not find peace.  || 4 ||   The soul-bride
        who remembers her Husband Lord in this world, by Guru's Grace,
        sees Him close at hand. She remains intuitively attuned to the
        Love of her Beloved; she makes the Word of His Shabad her decoration.
        || 5 ||   Blessed and fruitful is the coming of those who find
        the True Guru; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they
        burn their love of duality. The One Lord is permeating and pervading
        deep within the heart. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
        they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 6 ||   Those who
        do not serve the True Guru - why did they even come into this
        world? Cursed are their lives; they have uselessly wasted this
        human life. The self-willed manmukhs do not remember the Naam.
        Without the Naam, they suffer in terrible pain.  || 7 ||   The
        One who created the Universe, He alone knows it. He unites with
        Himself those who realize the Shabad. O Nanak, they alone receive
        the Naam, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny is recorded.
        || 8 || 1 || 32 || 33 ||   MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Primal Being
        is Himself remote and beyond. He Himself establishes, and having
        established, He disestablishes. The One Lord is pervading in all;
        those who become Gurmukh are honored.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        my soul is a sacrifice, to those who meditate on the Naam, the
        Name of the Formless Lord. </p>

      <p> He has no form or shape; He is seen within each and every heart.
        The Gurmukh comes to know the unknowable.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        You are God, Kind and Merciful. Without You, there is no other
        at all. When the Guru showers His Grace upon us, He blesses us
        with the Naam; through the Naam, we merge in the Naam.  || 2 ||
        You Yourself are the True Creator Lord. Your treasures are overflowing
        with devotional worship. The Gurmukhs obtain the Naam. Their minds
        are enraptured, and they easily and intuitively enter into Samaadhi.
        || 3 ||   Night and day, I sing Your Glorious Praises, God. I
        praise You, O my Beloved. Without You, there is no other for me
        to seek out. It is only by Guru's Grace that You are found.
        || 4 ||   The limits of the Inaccessible and Incomprehensible
        Lord cannot be found. Bestowing Your Mercy, You merge us into
        Yourself. Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, we
        meditate on the Lord. Serving the Shabad, peace is found.  ||
        5 ||   Praiseworthy is the tongue which sings the Lord's
        Glorious Praises. Praising the Naam, one becomes pleasing to the
        True One. The Gurmukh remains forever imbued with the Lord's
        Love. Meeting the True Lord, glory is obtained.  || 6 ||   The
        self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in ego. They lose their whole
        lives in the gamble. Within is the terrible darkness of greed,
        and so they come and go in reincarnation, over and over again.
        || 7 ||   The Creator Himself bestows Glory on those whom He
        Himself has so pre-destined. O Nanak, they receive the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, the Destroyer of fear; through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, they find peace.  || 8 || 1 || 34 ||   MAAJH,
        FIFTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:  The Unseen Lord is within, but He
        cannot be seen. He has taken the Jewel of the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, and He keeps it well concealed. The Inaccessible and
        Incomprehensible Lord is the highest of all. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, He is known.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        my soul is a sacrifice, to those who chant the Naam, in this Dark
        Age of Kali Yuga. The Beloved Saints were established by the True
        Lord. By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of their Darshan
        is obtained.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One who is sought by the
        Siddhas and the seekers, upon whom Brahma and Indra meditate within
        their hearts, whom the thirty-three million demi-gods search for - meeting
        the Guru, one comes to sing His Praises within the heart.  ||
        2 ||   Twenty-four hours a day, the wind breathes Your Name. The
        earth is Your servant, a slave at Your Feet. In the four sources
        of creation, and in all speech, You dwell. You are dear to the
        minds of all.  || 3 ||   The True Lord and Master is known to
        the Gurmukhs. He is realized through the Shabad, the Word of the
        Perfect Guru. Those who drink it in are satisfied. Through the
        Truest of the True, they are fulfilled.  || 4 ||   In the home
        of their own beings, they are peacefully and comfortably at ease.
        They are blissful, enjoying pleasures, and eternally joyful. They
        are wealthy, and the greatest kings; they center their minds on
        the Guru's Feet.  || 5 ||   First, You created nourishment;
        then, You created the living beings. There is no other Giver as
        Great as You, O my Lord and Master. None approach or equal You.
        || 6 ||   Those who are pleasing to You meditate on You. They
        practice the Mantra of the Holy. They themselves swim across,
        and they save all their ancestors and families as well. </p>

      <p> In the Court of the Lord, they meet with no obstruction.  || 7
        ||   You are so Great! You are the Highest of the High! You are
        Infinite, You are Everything! I am a sacrifice to You. Nanak is
        the slave of Your slaves.  || 8 || 1 || 35 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Who is liberated, and who is united? Who is a spiritual
        teacher, and who is a preacher? Who is a house-holder, and who
        is a renunciate? Who can estimate the Lord's Value?  || 1
        ||   How is one bound, and how is one freed of his bonds? How
        can one escape from the cycle of coming and going in reincarnation?
        Who is subject to karma, and who is beyond karma? Who chants the
        Name, and inspires others to chant it?  || 2 ||   Who is happy,
        and who is sad? Who, as sunmukh, turns toward the Guru, and who,
        as vaymukh, turns away from the Guru? How can one meet the Lord?
        How is one separated from Him? Who can reveal the way to me? 
        || 3 ||   What is that Word, by which the wandering mind can be
        restrained? What are those teachings, by which we may endure pain
        and pleasure alike? What is that lifestyle, by which we may come
        to meditate on the Supreme Lord? How may we sing the Kirtan of
        His Praises?  || 4 ||   The Gurmukh is liberated, and the Gurmukh
        is linked. The Gurmukh is the spiritual teacher, and the Gurmukh
        is the preacher. Blessed is the Gurmukh, the householder and the
        renunciate. The Gurmukh knows the Lord's Value.  || 5 ||
        Egotism is bondage; as Gurmukh, one is emancipated. The Gurmukh
        escapes the cycle of coming and going in reincarnation. The Gurmukh
        performs actions of good karma, and the Gurmukh is beyond karma.
        Whatever the Gurmukh does, is done in good faith.  || 6 ||   The
        Gurmukh is happy, while the self-willed manmukh is sad. The Gurmukh
        turns toward the Guru, and the self-willed manmukh turns away
        from the Guru. The Gurmukh is united with the Lord, while the
        manmukh is separated from Him. The Gurmukh reveals the way.  ||
        7 ||   The Guru's Instruction is the Word, by which the wandering
        mind is restrained. Through the Guru's Teachings, we can
        endure pain and pleasure alike. To live as Gurmukh is the lifestyle
        by which we come to meditate on the Supreme Lord. The Gurmukh
        sings the Kirtan of His Praises.  || 8 ||   The Lord Himself created
        the entire creation. He Himself acts, and causes others to act.
        He Himself establishes. From oneness, He has brought forth the
        countless multitudes. O Nanak, they shall merge into the One once
        again.  || 9 || 2 || 36 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  God is Eternal
        and Imperishable, so why should anyone be anxious? The Lord is
        Wealthy and Prosperous, so His humble servant should feel totally
        secure. O Giver of peace of the soul, of life, of honor - as
        You ordain, I obtain peace.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul
        is a sacrifice, to that Gurmukh whose mind and body are pleased
        with You. You are my mountain, You are my shelter and shield.
        No one can rival You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That person, unto
        whom Your actions seem sweet, comes to see the Supreme Lord God
        in each and every heart. In all places and interspaces, You exist.

      <p> Showering Your Mercy, You protect those who, through perfect destiny,
        merge into You.  || 3 ||   You pulled me out of the deep, dark
        well onto the dry ground. Showering Your Mercy, You blessed Your
        servant with Your Glance of Grace. I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Perfect, Immortal Lord. By speaking and hearing these Praises,
        they are not used up.  || 4 ||   Here and hereafter, You are our
        Protector. In the womb of the mother, You cherish and nurture
        the baby. The fire of Maya does not affect those who are imbued
        with the Lord's Love; they sing His Glorious Praises.  ||
        5 ||   What Praises of Yours can I chant and contemplate? Deep
        within my mind and body, I behold Your Presence. You are my Friend
        and Companion, my Lord and Master. Without You, I do not know
        any other at all.  || 6 ||   O God, that one, unto whom You have
        given shelter, is not touched by the hot winds. O my Lord and
        Master, You are my Sanctuary, the Giver of peace. Chanting, meditating
        on You in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, You are revealed.
        || 7 ||   You are Exalted, Unfathomable, Infinite and Invaluable.
        You are my True Lord and Master. I am Your servant and slave.
        You are the King, Your Sovereign Rule is True. Nanak is a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice to You.  || 8 || 3 || 37 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL,
        SECOND HOUSE:  Continually, continuously, remember the Merciful
        Lord. Never forget Him from your mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Join
        the Society of the Saints, and you shall not have to go down the
        path of Death. Take the Provisions of the Lord's Name with
        you, and no stain shall attach itself to your family.  || 1 ||
        Those who meditate on the Master shall not be thrown down into
        hell. Even the hot winds shall not touch them. The Lord has come
        to dwell within their minds.  || 2 ||   They alone are beautiful
        and attractive, who abide in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy. Those who have gathered in the wealth of the Lord's
        Name - they alone are deep and thoughtful and vast.  || 3 ||
        Drink in the Ambrosial Essence of the Name, and live by beholding
        the face of the Lord's servant. Let all your affairs be resolved,
        by continually worshipping the Feet of the Guru.  || 4 ||   He
        alone meditates on the Lord of the World, whom the Lord has made
        His Own. He alone is a warrior, and he alone is the chosen one,
        upon whose forehead good destiny is recorded.  || 5 ||   Within
        my mind, I meditate on God. For me, this is like the enjoyment
        of princely pleasures. Evil does not well up within me, since
        I am saved, and dedicated to truthful actions.  || 6 ||   I have
        enshrined the Creator within my mind; I have obtained the fruits
        of life's rewards. If your Husband Lord is pleasing to your
        mind, then your married life shall be eternal.  || 7 ||   I have
        obtained everlasting wealth; I have found the Sanctuary of the
        Dispeller of fear. Grasping hold of the hem of the Lord's
        robe, Nanak is saved. He has won the incomparable life.  || 8

        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> By the actions we have committed, we are separated from You. Please
        show Your Mercy, and unite us with Yourself, Lord. We have grown
        weary of wandering to the four corners of the earth and in the
        ten directions. We have come to Your Sanctuary, God. Without milk,
        a cow serves no purpose. Without water, the crop withers, and
        it will not bring a good price. If we do not meet the Lord, our
        Friend, how can we find our place of rest? Those homes, those
        hearts, in which the Husband Lord is not manifest - those towns
        and villages are like burning furnaces. All decorations, the chewing
        of betel to sweeten the breath, and the body itself, are all useless
        and vain. Without God, our Husband, our Lord and Master, all friends
        and companions are like the Messenger of Death. This is Nanak's
        prayer: &quot;Please show Your Mercy, and bestow Your Name. O
        my Lord and Master, please unite me with Yourself, O God, in the
        Eternal Mansion of Your Presence&quot;.  || 1 ||   In the month
        of Chayt, by meditating on the Lord of the Universe, a deep and
        profound joy arises. Meeting with the humble Saints, the Lord
        is found, as we chant His Name with our tongues. Those who have
        found God - blessed is their coming into this world. Those
        who live without Him, for even an instant - their lives are
        rendered useless. The Lord is totally pervading the water, the
        land, and all space. He is contained in the forests as well. Those
        who do not remember God - how much pain must they suffer! Those
        who dwell upon their God have great good fortune. My mind yearns
        for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. O Nanak, my
        mind is so thirsty! I touch the feet of one who unites me with
        God in the month of Chayt.  || 2 ||   In the month of Vaisaakh,
        how can the bride be patient? She is separated from her Beloved.
        She has forgotten the Lord, her Life-companion, her Master; she
        has become attached to Maya, the deceitful one. Neither son, nor
        spouse, nor wealth shall go along with you - only the Eternal
        Lord. Entangled and enmeshed in the love of false occupations,
        the whole world is perishing. Without the Naam, the Name of the
        One Lord, they lose their lives in the hereafter. Forgetting the
        Merciful Lord, they are ruined. Without God, there is no other
        at all. Pure is the reputation of those who are attached to the
        Feet of the Beloved Lord. </p>

      <p> Nanak makes this prayer to God: &quot;Please, come and unite me
        with Yourself.&quot; The month of Vaisaakh is beautiful and pleasant,
        when the Saint causes me to meet the Lord.  || 3 ||   In the month
        of Jayt'h, the bride longs to meet with the Lord. All bow
        in humility before Him. One who has grasped the hem of the robe
        of the Lord, the True Friend - no one can keep him in bondage.
        God's Name is the Jewel, the Pearl. It cannot be stolen or
        taken away. In the Lord are all pleasures which please the mind.
        As the Lord wishes, so He acts, and so His creatures act. They
        alone are called blessed, whom God has made His Own. If people
        could meet the Lord by their own efforts, why would they be crying
        out in the pain of separation? Meeting Him in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, celestial bliss is enjoyed.
        In the month of Jayt'h, the playful Husband Lord meets her,
        upon whose forehead such good destiny is recorded.  || 4 ||  
        The month of Aasaarh seems burning hot, to those who are not close
        to their Husband Lord. They have forsaken God the Primal Being,
        the Life of the World, and they have come to rely upon mere mortals.
        In the love of duality, the soul-bride is ruined; around her neck
        she wears the noose of Death. As you plant, so shall you harvest;
        your destiny is recorded on your forehead. The life-night passes
        away, and in the end, one comes to regret and repent, and then
        depart with no hope at all. Those who meet with the Holy Saints
        are liberated in the Court of the Lord. Show Your Mercy to me,
        O God; I am thirsty for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. Without
        You, God, there is no other at all. This is Nanak's humble
        prayer. The month of Aasaarh is pleasant, when the Feet of the
        Lord abide in the mind.  || 5 ||   In the month of Saawan, the
        soul-bride is happy, if she falls in love with the Lotus Feet
        of the Lord. Her mind and body are imbued with the Love of the
        True One; His Name is her only Support. The pleasures of corruption
        are false. All that is seen shall turn to ashes. The drops of
        the Lord's Nectar are so beautiful! Meeting the Holy Saint,
        we drink these in. The forests and the meadows are rejuvenated
        and refreshed with the Love of God, the All-powerful, Infinite
        Primal Being. My mind yearns to meet the Lord. If only He would
        show His Mercy, and unite me with Himself! Those brides who have
        obtained God - I am forever a sacrifice to them. O Nanak, when
        the Dear Lord shows kindness, He adorns His bride with the Word
        of His Shabad. Saawan is delightful for those happy soul-brides
        whose hearts are adorned with the Necklace of the Lord's
        Name.  || 6 ||   In the month of Bhaadon, she is deluded by doubt,
        because of her attachment to duality. She may wear thousands of
        ornaments, but they are of no use at all. On that day when the
        body perishes - at that time, she becomes a ghost. The Messenger
        of Death seizes and holds her, and does not tell anyone his secret.
        And her loved ones - in an instant, they move on, leaving her
        all alone. She wrings her hands, her body writhes in pain, and
        she turns from black to white. As she has planted, so does she
        harvest; such is the field of karma. Nanak seeks God's Sanctuary;
        God has given him the Boat of His Feet. Those who love the Guru,
        the Protector and Savior, in Bhaadon, shall not be thrown down
        into hell.  || 7 ||   In the month of Assu, my love for the Lord
        overwhelms me. </p>

      <p> How can I go and meet the Lord? My mind and body are so thirsty
        for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Won't someone please
        come and lead me to him, O my mother. The Saints are the helpers
        of the Lord's lovers; I fall and touch their feet. Without
        God, how can I find peace? There is nowhere else to go. Those
        who have tasted the sublime essence of His Love, remain satisfied
        and fulfilled. They renounce their selfishness and conceit, and
        they pray, &quot;God, please attach me to the hem of Your robe.&quot;
        Those whom the Husband Lord has united with Himself, shall not
        be separated from Him again. Without God, there is no other at
        all. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord. In Assu, the
        Lord, the Sovereign King, has granted His Mercy, and they dwell
        in peace.  || 8 ||   In the month of Katak, do good deeds. Do
        not try to blame anyone else. Forgetting the Transcendent Lord,
        all sorts of illnesses are contracted. Those who turn their backs
        on the Lord shall be separated from Him and consigned to reincarnation,
        over and over again. In an instant, all of Maya's sensual
        pleasures turn bitter. No one can then serve as your intermediary.
        Unto whom can we turn and cry? By one's own actions, nothing
        can be done; destiny was pre-determined from the very beginning.
        By great good fortune, I meet my God, and then all pain of separation
        departs. Please protect Nanak, God; O my Lord and Master, please
        release me from bondage. In Katak, in the Company of the Holy,
        all anxiety vanishes.  || 9 ||   In the month of Maghar, those
        who sit with their Beloved Husband Lord are beautiful. How can
        their glory be measured? Their Lord and Master blends them with
        Himself. Their bodies and minds blossom forth in the Lord; they
        have the companionship of the Holy Saints. Those who lack the
        Company of the Holy, remain all alone. Their pain never departs,
        and they fall into the grip of the Messenger of Death. Those who
        have ravished and enjoyed their God, are seen to be continually
        exalted and uplifted. They wear the Necklace of the jewels, emeralds
        and rubies of the Lord's Name. Nanak seeks the dust of the
        feet of those who take to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Door.
        Those who worship and adore God in Maghar, do not suffer the cycle
        of reincarnation ever again.  || 10 ||   In the month of Poh,
        the cold does not touch those, whom the Husband Lord hugs close
        in His Embrace. Their minds are transfixed by His Lotus Feet.
        They are attached to the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
        Seek the Protection of the Lord of the Universe; His service is
        truly profitable. Corruption shall not touch you, when you join
        the Holy Saints and sing the Lord's Praises. From where it
        originated, there the soul is blended again. It is absorbed in
        the Love of the True Lord. When the Supreme Lord God grasps someone's
        hand, he shall never again suffer separation from Him. I am a
        sacrifice, 100,000 times, to the Lord, my Friend, the Unapproachable
        and Unfathomable. Please preserve my honor, Lord; Nanak begs at
        Your Door. Poh is beautiful, and all comforts come to that one,
        whom the Carefree Lord has forgiven.  || 11 ||   In the month
        of Maagh, let your cleansing bath be the dust of the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. Meditate and listen to the Name of the
        Lord, and give it to everyone. In this way, the filth of lifetimes
        of karma shall be removed, and egotistical pride shall vanish
        from your mind. </p>

      <p> Sexual desire and anger shall not seduce you, and the dog of greed
        shall depart. Those who walk on the Path of Truth shall be praised
        throughout the world. Be kind to all beings - this is more
        meritorious than bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of
        pilgrimage and the giving of charity. That person, upon whom the
        Lord bestows His Mercy, is a wise person. Nanak is a sacrifice
        to those who have merged with God. In Maagh, they alone are known
        as true, unto whom the Perfect Guru is Merciful.  || 12 ||   In
        the month of Phalgun, bliss comes to those, unto whom the Lord,
        the Friend, has been revealed. The Saints, the Lord's helpers,
        in their mercy, have united me with Him. My bed is beautiful,
        and I have all comforts. I feel no sadness at all. My desires
        have been fulfilled - by great good fortune, I have obtained
        the Sovereign Lord as my Husband. Join with me, my sisters, and
        sing the songs of rejoicing and the Hymns of the Lord of the Universe.
        There is no other like the Lord - there is no equal to Him.
        He embellishes this world and the world hereafter, and He gives
        us our permanent home there. He rescues us from the world-ocean;
        never again do we have to run the cycle of reincarnation. I have
        only one tongue, but Your Glorious Virtues are beyond counting.
        Nanak is saved, falling at Your Feet. In Phalgun, praise Him continually;
        He has not even an iota of greed.  || 13 ||   Those who meditate
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord - their affairs are all resolved.
        Those who meditate on the Perfect Guru, the Lord-Incarnate - they
        are judged true in the Court of the Lord. The Lord's Feet
        are the Treasure of all peace and comfort for them; they cross
        over the terrifying and treacherous world-ocean. They obtain love
        and devotion, and they do not burn in corruption. Falsehood has
        vanished, duality has been erased, and they are totally overflowing
        with Truth. They serve the Supreme Lord God, and enshrine the
        One Lord within their minds. The months, the days, and the moments
        are auspicious, for those upon whom the Lord casts His Glance
        of Grace. Nanak begs for the blessing of Your Vision, O Lord.

      <p> I serve my True Guru, and meditate on Him all day and night. Renouncing
        selfishness and conceit, I seek His Sanctuary, and speak sweet
        words to Him. Through countless lifetimes and incarnations, I
        was separated from Him. O Lord, you are my Friend and Companion - please
        unite me with Yourself. Those who are separated from the Lord
        do not dwell in peace, O sister. Without their Husband Lord, they
        find no comfort. I have searched and seen all realms. My own evil
        actions have kept me separate from Him; why should I accuse anyone
        else? Bestow Your Mercy, God, and save me! No one else can bestow
        Your Mercy. Without You, Lord, we roll around in the dust. Unto
        whom should we utter our cries of distress? This is Nanak's
        prayer: &quot;May my eyes behold the Lord, the Angelic Being.&quot;
        || 1 ||   The Lord hears the anguish of the soul; He is the All-powerful

      <p> In death and in life, worship and adore the Lord, the Support
        of all. In this world and in the next, the soul-bride belongs
        to her Husband Lord, who has such a vast family. He is Lofty and
        Inaccessible. His Wisdom is Unfathomable. He has no end or limitation.
        That service is pleasing to Him, which makes one humble, like
        the dust of the feet of the Saints. He is the Patron of the poor,
        the Merciful, Luminous Lord, the Redeemer of sinners. From the
        very beginning, and throughout the ages, the True Name of the
        Creator has been our Saving Grace. No one can know His Value;
        no one can weigh it. He dwells deep within the mind and body.
        O Nanak, He cannot be measured. I am forever a sacrifice to those
        who serve God, day and night.  || 2 ||   The Saints worship and
        adore Him forever and ever; He is the Forgiver of all. He fashioned
        the soul and the body, and by His Kindness, He bestowed the soul.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, worship and adore
        Him, and chant His Pure Mantra. His Value cannot be evaluated.
        The Transcendent Lord is endless. That one, within whose mind
        the Lord abides, is said to be most fortunate. The soul's
        desires are fulfilled, upon meeting the Master, our Husband Lord.
        Nanak lives by chanting the Lord's Name; all sorrows have
        been erased. One who does not forget Him, day and night, is continually
        rejuvenated.  || 3 ||   God is overflowing with all powers. I
        have no honor - He is my resting place. I have grasped the
        Support of the Lord within my mind; I live by chanting and meditating
        on His Name. Grant Your Grace, God, and bless me, that I may merge
        into the dust of the feet of the humble. As You keep me, so do
        I live. I wear and eat whatever You give me. May I make the effort,
        O God, to sing Your Glorious Praises in the Company of the Holy.
        I can conceive of no other place; where could I go to lodge a
        complaint? You are the Dispeller of ignorance, the Destroyer of
        darkness, O Lofty, Unfathomable and Unapproachable Lord. Please
        unite this separated one with Yourself; this is Nanak's yearning.
        That day shall bring every joy, O Lord, when I take to the Feet
        of the Guru.  || 4 || 1 || </p>

      <p> SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  The Guru is the Giver; the Guru is the House
        of ice. The Guru is the Light of the three worlds. O Nanak, He
        is everlasting wealth. Place your mind's faith in Him, and
        you shall find peace.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  First, the baby
        loves mother's milk; second, he learns of his mother and
        father; third, his brothers, sisters and aunts; fourth, the love
        of play awakens. Fifth, he runs after food and drink; sixth, in
        his sexual desire, he does not respect social customs. Seventh,
        he gathers wealth and dwells in his house; eighth, he becomes
        angry, and his body is consumed. Ninth, he turns grey, and his
        breathing becomes labored; tenth, he is cremated, and turns to
        ashes. His companions send him off, crying out and lamenting.
        The swan of the soul takes flight, and asks which way to go. <br>
