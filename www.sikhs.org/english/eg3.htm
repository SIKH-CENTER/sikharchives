      <p> O Lord, please give it to me, in Your Natural Way.  || 5 || 2
        || 35 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:  Everyone belongs
        to the One who rules the Universe. The Gurmukh practices good
        deeds, and the truth is revealed in the heart. True is the reputation
        of the true, within whom truth abides. Those who meet the True
        Lord are not separated again; they come to dwell in the home of
        the self deep within.  || 1 ||   O my Lord! Without the Lord,
        I have no other at all. The True Guru leads us to meet the Immaculate
        True God through the Word of His Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        One whom the Lord merges into Himself is merged in the Shabad,
        and remains so merged. No one merges with Him through the love
        of duality; over and over again, they come and go in reincarnation.
        The One Lord permeates all. The One Lord is pervading everywhere.
        That Gurmukh, unto whom the Lord shows His Kindness, is absorbed
        in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   After all their
        reading, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers
        argue and debate. Their intellect and understanding are perverted;
        they just don't understand. They are filled with greed and
        corruption. Through 8.4 million incarnations they wander lost
        and confused; through all their wandering and roaming, they are
        ruined. They act according to their pre-ordained destiny, which
        no one can erase.  || 3 ||   It is very difficult to serve the
        True Guru. Surrender your head; give up your selfishness. Realizing
        the Shabad, one meets with the Lord, and all one's service
        is accepted. By personally experiencing the Personality of the
        Guru, one's own personality is uplifted, and one's light
        merges into the Light. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny
        come to meet the True Guru.  || 4 ||   O mind, don't cry
        out that you are hungry, always hungry; stop complaining. The
        One who created the 8.4 million species of beings gives sustenance
        to all. The Fearless Lord is forever Merciful; He takes care of
        all. O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands, and finds the Door of Liberation.
        || 5 || 3 || 36 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who hear
        and believe, find the home of the self deep within. Through the
        Guru's Teachings, they praise the True Lord; they find the Lord,
        the Treasure of Excellence. Attuned to the Word of the Shabad,
        they are immaculate and pure. I am forever a sacrifice to them.
        Those people, within whose hearts the Lord abides, are radiant
        and enlightened.  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate on the Immaculate
        Lord, Har, Har. Those whose have such pre-ordained destiny written
        on their foreheads - those Gurmukhs remain absorbed in the
        Lord's Love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Saints, see clearly
        that the Lord is near at hand; He is pervading everywhere. Those
        who follow the Guru's Teachings realize Him, and see Him
        Ever-present. He dwells forever in the minds of the virtuous.
        He is far removed from those worthless people who lack virtue.
        The self-willed manmukhs are totally without virtue. Without the
        Name, they die in frustration.  || 2 ||   Those who hear and believe
        in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, meditate on the Lord in
        their minds. Night and day, they are steeped in devotion; their
        minds and bodies become pure. The color of the world is false
        and weak; when it washes away, people cry out in pain. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Those who have the Radiant Light of the Naam within, become steady
        and stable, forever and ever.  || 3 ||   The blessing of this
        human life has been obtained, but still, people do not lovingly
        focus their thoughts on the Name of the Lord. Their feet slip,
        and they cannot stay here any longer. And in the next world, they
        find no place of rest at all. This opportunity shall not come
        again. In the end, they depart, regretting and repenting. Those
        whom the Lord blesses with His Glance of Grace are saved; they
        are lovingly attuned to the Lord.  || 4 ||   They all show off
        and pretend, but the self-willed manmukhs do not understand. Those
        Gurmukhs who are pure of heart - their service is accepted.
        They sing the Glorious Praise of the Lord; they read about the
        Lord each day. Singing the Praise of the Lord, they merge in absorption.
        O Nanak, the words of those who are lovingly attuned to the Naam
        are true forever.  || 5 || 4 || 37 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:
        Those who meditate single-mindedly on the Naam, and contemplate
        the Teachings of the Guru - their faces are forever radiant
        in the Court of the True Lord. They drink in the Ambrosial Nectar
        forever and ever, and they love the True Name.  || 1 ||   O Siblings
        of Destiny, the Gurmukhs are honored forever. They meditate forever
        on the Lord, Har, Har, and they wash off the filth of egotism.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukhs do not know the
        Naam. Without the Name, they lose their honor. They do not savor
        the Taste of the Shabad; they are attached to the love of duality.
        They are worms in the filth of manure. They fall into manure,
        and into manure they are absorbed.  || 2 ||   Fruitful are the
        lives of those who walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.
        Their families are saved; blessed are the mothers who gave birth
        to them. By His Will He grants His Grace; those who are so blessed,
        meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   The Gurmukhs
        meditate on the Naam; they eradicate selfishness and conceit from
        within. They are pure, inwardly and outwardly; they merge into
        the Truest of the True. O Nanak, blessed is the coming of those
        who follow the Guru's Teachings and meditate on the Lord.
        || 4 || 5 || 38 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  The devotees of
        the Lord have the Wealth and Capital of the Lord; with Guru's
        Advice, they carry on their trade. They praise the Name of the
        Lord forever and ever. The Name of the Lord is their Merchandise
        and Support. The Perfect Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord
        into the Lord's devotees; it is an Inexhaustible Treasure.
        || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, instruct your minds in this
        way. O mind, why are you so lazy? Become Gurmukh, and meditate
        on the Naam.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Devotion to the Lord is love
        for the Lord. The Gurmukh reflects deeply and contemplates. Hypocrisy
        is not devotion - speaking words of duality leads only to misery.
        Those humble beings who are filled with keen understanding and
        meditative contemplation - even though they intermingle with
        others, they remain distinct.  || 2 ||   Those who keep the Lord
        enshrined within their hearts are said to be the servants of the
        Lord. Placing mind and body in offering before the Lord, they
        conquer and eradicate egotism from within. Blessed and acclaimed
        is that Gurmukh, who shall never be defeated.  || 3 ||   Those
        who receive His Grace find Him. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Without His Grace, He cannot be found. The 8.4 million species
        of beings all yearn for the Lord. Those whom He unites, come to
        be united with the Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Lord,
        and remains forever absorbed in the Lord's Name.  || 4 ||
        6 || 39 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  The Name of the Lord is
        the Ocean of Peace; the Gurmukhs obtain it. Meditating on the
        Naam, night and day, they are easily and intuitively absorbed
        in the Naam. Their inner beings are immersed in the True Lord;
        they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Siblings
        of Destiny, the world is in misery, engrossed in the love of duality.
        In the Sanctuary of the Guru, peace is found, meditating on the
        Naam night and day.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The truthful ones are
        not stained by filth. Meditating on the Lord, their minds remain
        pure. The Gurmukhs realize the Word of the Shabad; they are immersed
        in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's Name. The Guru has
        lit the brilliant light of spiritual wisdom, and the darkness
        of ignorance has been dispelled.  || 2 ||   The self-willed manmukhs
        are polluted. They are filled with the pollution of egotism, wickedness
        and desire. Without the Shabad, this pollution is not washed off;
        through the cycle of death and rebirth, they waste away in misery.
        Engrossed in this transitory drama, they are not at home in either
        this world or the next.  || 3 ||   For the Gurmukh, the love of
        the Name of the Lord is chanting, deep meditation and self-discipline.
        The Gurmukh meditates forever on the Name of the One Creator Lord.
        O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Support
        of all beings.  || 4 || 7 || 40 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:
        The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in emotional attachment;
        they are not balanced or detached. They do not comprehend the
        Word of the Shabad. They suffer in pain forever, and lose their
        honor in the Court of the Lord. The Gurmukhs shed their ego; attuned
        to the Naam, they find peace.  || 1 ||   O my mind, day and night,
        you are always full of wishful hopes. Serve the True Guru, and
        your emotional attachment shall be totally burnt away; remain
        detached within the home of your heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        The Gurmukhs do good deeds and blossom forth; balanced and detached
        in the Lord, they are in ecstasy. Night and day, they perform
        devotional worship, day and night; subduing their ego, they are
        carefree. By great good fortune, I found the Sat Sangat, the True
        Congregation; I have found the Lord, with intuitive ease and ecstasy.
        || 2 ||   That person is a Holy Saadhu, and a renouncer of the
        world, whose heart is filled with the Naam. His inner being is
        not touched by anger or dark energies at all; he has lost his
        selfishness and conceit. The True Guru has revealed to him the
        Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he drinks in the Sublime
        Essence of the Lord, and is satisfied.  || 3 ||   Whoever has
        found it, has done so in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy. Through perfect good fortune, such balanced detachment is
        attained. The self-willed manmukhs wander around lost, but they
        do not know the True Guru. They are inwardly attached to egotism.
        O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Shabad are dyed in the Color
        of the Lord's Name. Without the Fear of God, how can they
        retain this Color?  || 4 || 8 || 41 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:
        Within the home of your own inner being, the merchandise is obtained.
        All commodities are within. Each and every moment, dwell on the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukhs obtain it. The Treasure
        of the Naam is inexhaustible. By great good fortune, it is obtained.

      <p> O my mind, give up slander, egotism and arrogance. Become Gurmukh,
        and meditate forever on the Dear Lord, the One and Only Creator.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The faces of the Gurmukhs are radiant and
        bright; they reflect on the Word of the Guru's Shabad. They
        obtain peace in this world and the next, chanting and meditating
        within their hearts on the Lord. Within the home of their own
        inner being, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence,
        reflecting on the Guru's Shabad.  || 2 ||   Those who turn
        their faces away from the True Guru shall have their faces blackened.
        Night and day, they suffer in pain; they see the noose of Death
        always hovering above them. Even in their dreams, they find no
        peace; they are consumed by the fires of intense anxiety.  ||
        3 ||   The One Lord is the Giver of all; He Himself bestows all
        blessings. No one else has any say in this; He gives just as He
        pleases. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs obtain Him; He Himself knows Himself.
        || 4 || 9 || 42 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Serve your True
        Lord and Master, and you shall be blessed with true greatness.
        By Guru's Grace, He abides in the mind, and egotism is driven
        out. This wandering mind comes to rest, when the Lord casts His
        Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, become Gurmukh,
        and meditate on the Name of the Lord. The Treasure of the Naam
        abides forever within the mind, and one's place of rest is
        found in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The minds and bodies of the self-willed manmukhs are filled
        with darkness; they find no shelter, no place of rest. Through
        countless incarnations they wander lost, like crows in a deserted
        house. Through the Guru's Teachings, the heart is illuminated.
        Through the Shabad, the Name of the Lord is received.  || 2 ||
        In the corruption of the three qualities, there is blindness;
        in attachment to Maya, there is darkness. The greedy people serve
        others, instead of the Lord, although they loudly announce their
        reading of scriptures. They are burnt to death by their own corruption;
        they are not at home, on either this shore or the one beyond.
        || 3 ||   In attachment to Maya, they have forgotten the Father,
        the Cherisher of the World. Without the Guru, all are unconscious;
        they are held in bondage by the Messenger of Death. O Nanak, through
        the Guru's Teachings, you shall be saved, contemplating the
        True Name.  || 4 || 10 || 43 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  The
        three qualities hold people in attachment to Maya. The Gurmukh
        attains the fourth state of higher consciousness. Granting His
        Grace, God unites us with Himself. The Name of the Lord comes
        to abide within the mind. Those who have the treasure of goodness
        join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.  || 1 ||   O Siblings
        of Destiny, follow the Guru's Teachings and dwell in truth.
        Practice truth, and only truth, and merge in the True Word of
        the Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am a sacrifice to those who
        recognize the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Renouncing selfishness,
        I fall at their feet, and walk in harmony with His Will. Earning
        the Profit of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am intuitively
        absorbed in the Naam.  || 2 ||   Without the Guru, the Mansion
        of the Lord's Presence is not found, and the Naam is not
        obtained. Seek and find such a True Guru, who shall lead you to
        the True Lord. Destroy your evil passions, and you shall dwell
        in peace. Whatever pleases the Lord comes to pass.  || 3 ||  
        As one knows the True Guru, so is the peace obtained. There is
        no doubt at all about this, but those who love Him are very rare.
        O Nanak, the One Light has two forms; through the Shabad, union
        is attained. </p>

      <p> || 4 || 11 || 44 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Discarding the
        Ambrosial Nectar, they greedily grab the poison; they serve others,
        instead of the Lord. They lose their faith, they have no understanding;
        night and day, they suffer in pain. The blind, self-willed manmukhs
        do not even think of the Lord; they are drowned to death without
        water.  || 1 ||   O mind, vibrate and meditate forever on the
        Lord; seek the Protection of His Sanctuary. If the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad abides deep within, then you shall not forget
        the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This body is the puppet of Maya.
        The evil of egotism is within it. Coming and going through birth
        and death, the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor. Serving
        the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained, and one's light
        merges into the Light.  || 2 ||   Serving the True Guru brings
        a deep and profound peace, and one's desires are fulfilled.
        Abstinence, truthfulness and self-discipline are obtained, and
        the body is purified; the Lord, Har, Har, comes to dwell within
        the mind. Such a person remains blissful forever, day and night.
        Meeting the Beloved, peace is found.  || 3 ||   I am a sacrifice
        to those who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru. In the Court
        of the True One, they are blessed with true greatness; they are
        intuitively absorbed into the True Lord. O Nanak, by His Glance
        of Grace He is found; the Gurmukh is united in His Union.  ||
        4 || 12 || 45 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh
        performs religious rituals, like the unwanted bride decorating
        her body. Her Husband Lord does not come to her bed; day after
        day, she grows more and more miserable. She does not attain the
        Mansion of His Presence; she does not find the door to His House.
        || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, meditate on the Naam with one-pointed
        mind. Remain united with the Society of the Saints; chant the
        Name of the Lord, and find peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Gurmukh
        is the happy and pure soul-bride forever. She keeps her Husband
        Lord enshrined within her heart. Her speech is sweet, and her
        way of life is humble. She enjoys the Bed of her Husband Lord.
        The happy and pure soul-bride is noble; she has infinite love
        for the Guru.  || 2 ||   By perfect good fortune, one meets the
        True Guru, when one's destiny is awakened. Suffering and
        doubt are cut out from within, and peace is obtained. One who
        walks in harmony with the Guru's Will shall not suffer in
        pain.  || 3 ||   The Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar, is in the Guru's
        Will. With intuitive ease, it is obtained. Those who are destined
        to have it, drink it in; their egotism is eradicated from within.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and is united with
        the True Lord.  || 4 || 13 || 46 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:
        If you know that He is your Husband Lord, offer your body and
        mind to Him. Behave like the happy and pure soul-bride. With intuitive
        ease, you shall merge with the True Lord, and He shall bless you
        with true greatness.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, without
        the Guru, there is no devotional worship. Without the Guru, devotion
        is not obtained, even though everyone may long for it.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The soul-bride in love with duality goes around the
        wheel of reincarnation, through 8.4 million incarnations. Without
        the Guru, she finds no sleep, and she passes her life-night in
        pain. Without the Shabad, she does not find her Husband Lord,
        and her life wastes away in vain.  || </p>

      <p> 2 ||   Practicing egotism, selfishness and conceit, she wanders
        around the world, but her wealth and property will not go with
        her. The spiritually blind do not even think of the Naam; they
        are all bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death. Meeting the
        True Guru, the wealth is obtained, contemplating the Name of the
        Lord in the heart.  || 3 ||   Those who are attuned to the Naam
        are immaculate and pure; through the Guru, they obtain intuitive
        peace and poise. Their minds and bodies are dyed in the Color
        of the Lord's Love, and their tongues savor His Sublime Essence.
        O Nanak, that Primal Color which the Lord has applied, shall never
        fade away.  || 4 || 14 || 47 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  By
        His Grace one becomes Gurmukh, worshipping the Lord with devotion.
        Without the Guru there is no devotional worship. Those whom He
        unites with Himself, understand and become pure. The Dear Lord
        is True, and True is the Word of His Bani. Through the Shabad,
        we merge with Him.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny: those who
        lack devotion - why have they even bothered to come into the
        world? They do not serve the Perfect Guru; they waste away their
        lives in vain.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord Himself, the Life
        of the World, is the Giver of Peace. He Himself forgives, and
        unites with Himself. So what about all these poor beings and creatures?
        What can anyone say? He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glory.
        He Himself enjoins us to His Service.  || 2 ||   Gazing upon their
        families, people are lured and trapped by emotional attachment,
        but none will go along with them in the end. Serving the True
        Guru, one finds the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence. His Value
        cannot be estimated. The Lord God is my Friend and Companion.
        God shall be my Helper and Support in the end.  || 3 ||   Within
        your conscious mind, you may say anything, but without the Guru,
        selfishness is not removed. The Dear Lord is the Giver, the Lover
        of His devotees. By His Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind.
        O Nanak, by His Grace, He bestows enlightened awareness; God Himself
        blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness.  || 4 || 15 || 48
        ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Blessed is the mother who gave
        birth; blessed and respected is the father of one who serves the
        True Guru and finds peace. His arrogant pride is banished from
        within. Standing at the Lord's Door, the humble Saints serve
        Him; they find the Treasure of Excellence.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Lord. The Word of the Guru's
        Shabad abides within the mind, and the body and mind become pure.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By His Grace, He has come into my home;
        He Himself has come to meet me. Singing His Praises through the
        Shabads of the Guru, we are dyed in His Color with intuitive ease.
        Becoming truthful, we merge with the True One; remaining blended
        with Him, we shall never be separated again.  || 2 ||   Whatever
        is to be done, the Lord is doing. No one else can do anything.
        Those separated from Him for so long are reunited with Him once
        again by the True Guru, who takes them into His Own Account. He
        Himself assigns all to their tasks; nothing else can be done.
        || 3 ||   One whose mind and body are imbued with the Lord's
        Love gives up egotism and corruption. Day and night, the Name
        of the One Lord, the Fearless and Formless One, dwells within
        the heart. O Nanak, He blends us with Himself, through the Perfect,
        Infinite Word of His Shabad.  || 4 || 16 || 49 ||   SIREE RAAG,
        THIRD MEHL:  The Lord of the Universe is the Treasure of Excellence;
        His limits cannot be found. </p>

      <p> He is not obtained by mouthing mere words, but by rooting out
        ego from within. Meeting the True Guru, one is permeated forever
        with the Fear of God, who Himself comes to dwell within the mind.
        || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, one who becomes Gurmukh and
        understands this is very rare. To act without understanding is
        to lose the treasure of this human life.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        Those who have tasted it, enjoy its flavor; without tasting it,
        they wander in doubt, lost and deceived. The True Name is the
        Ambrosial Nectar; no one can describe it. Drinking it in, one
        becomes honorable, absorbed in the Perfect Word of the Shabad.
        || 2 ||   He Himself gives, and then we receive. Nothing else
        can be done. The Gift is in the Hands of the Great Giver. At the
        Guru's Door, in the Gurdwara, it is received. Whatever He
        does, comes to pass. All act according to His Will.  || 3 || 
        The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is abstinence, truthfulness,
        and self-restraint. Without the Name, no one becomes pure. Through
        perfect good fortune, the Naam comes to abide within the mind.
        Through the Shabad, we merge into Him. O Nanak, one who lives
        in intuitive peace and poise, imbued with the Lord's Love,
        obtains the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 4 || 17 || 50 ||
        SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  You may torment your body with extremes
        of self-discipline, practice intensive meditation and hang upside-down,
        but your ego will not be eliminated from within. You may perform
        religious rituals, and still never obtain the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, remain dead
        while yet alive, and the Name of the Lord shall come to dwell
        within the mind.  || 1 ||   Listen, O my mind: hurry to the Protection
        of the Guru's Sanctuary. By Guru's Grace you shall be
        saved. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall cross
        over the terrifying world-ocean of poison.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Everything under the influence of the three qualities shall
        perish; the love of duality is corrupting. The Pandits, the religious
        scholars, read the scriptures, but they are trapped in the bondage
        of emotional attachment. In love with evil, they do not understand.
        Meeting the Guru, the bondage of the three qualities is cut away,
        and in the fourth state, the Door of Liberation is attained. 
        || 2 ||   Through the Guru, the Path is found, and the darkness
        of emotional attachment is dispelled. If one dies through the
        Shabad, then salvation is obtained, and one finds the Door of
        Liberation. By Guru's Grace, one remains blended with the
        True Name of the Creator.  || 3 ||   This mind is very powerful;
        we cannot escape it just by trying. In the love of duality, people
        suffer in pain, condemned to terrible punishment. O Nanak, those
        who are attached to the Naam are saved; through the Shabad, their
        ego is banished.  || 4 || 18 || 51 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:
        By His Grace, the Guru is found, and the Name of the Lord is
        implanted within. Without the Guru, no one has obtained it; they
        waste away their lives in vain. The self-willed manmukhs create
        karma, and in the Court of the Lord, they receive their punishment.
        || 1 ||   O mind, give up the love of duality. The Lord dwells
        within you; serving the Guru, you shall find peace.  ||  Pause
        ||   When you love the Truth, your words are true; they reflect
        the True Word of the Shabad. The Name of the Lord dwells within
        the mind; egotism and anger are wiped away. Meditating on the
        Naam with a pure mind, the Door of Liberation is found.  || 2
        ||   Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes. It dies and is
        re-born; it continues coming and going in reincarnation. The self-willed
        manmukhs do not recognize the Shabad; they forfeit their honor,
        and depart in disgrace. </p>

      <p> Serving the Guru, the Name is obtained, and one remains absorbed
        in the True Lord.  || 3 ||   With faith in the Shabad, the Guru
        is found, and selfishness is eradicated from within. Night and
        day, worship the True Lord with devotion and love forever. The
        Treasure of the Naam abides in the mind; O Nanak, in the poise
        of perfect balance, merge into the Lord.  || 4 || 19 || 52 ||
        SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who do not serve the True Guru
        shall be miserable throughout the four ages. The Primal Being
        is within their own home, but they do not recognize Him. They
        are plundered by their egotistical pride and arrogance. Cursed
        by the True Guru, they wander around the world begging, until
        they are exhausted. They do not serve the True Word of the Shabad,
        which is the solution to all of their problems.  || 1 ||   O my
        mind, see the Lord ever close at hand. He shall remove the pains
        of death and rebirth; the Word of the Shabad shall fill you to
        overflowing.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who praise the True One
        are true; the True Name is their Support. They act truthfully,
        in love with the True Lord. The True King has written His Order,
        which no one can erase. The self-willed manmukhs do not obtain
        the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. The false are plundered
        by falsehood.  || 2 ||   Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes.
        Without the Guru, there is utter darkness. In emotional attachment
        to Maya, they have forgotten the Great Giver, the Giver of Peace.
        Those who serve the True Guru are saved; they keep the True One
        enshrined in their hearts. By His Grace, we find the Lord, and
        reflect on the True Word of the Shabad.  || 3 ||   Serving the
        True Guru, the mind becomes immaculate and pure; egotism and corruption
        are discarded. So abandon your selfishness, and remain dead while
        yet alive. Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The
        pursuit of worldly affairs comes to an end, when you embrace love
        for the True One. Those who are attuned to Truth - their faces
        are radiant in the Court of the True Lord.  || 4 ||   Those who
        do not have faith in the Primal Being, the True Guru, and who
        do not enshrine love for the Shabad - they take their cleansing
        baths, and give to charity again and again, but they are ultimately
        consumed by their love of duality. When the Dear Lord Himself
        grants His Grace, they are inspired to love the Naam. O Nanak,
        immerse yourself in the Naam, through the Infinite Love of the
        Guru.  || 5 || 20 || 53 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Whom shall
        I serve? What shall I chant? I will go and ask the Guru. I will
        accept the Will of the True Guru, and eradicate selfishness from
        within. By this work and service, the Naam shall come to dwell
        within my mind. Through the Naam, peace is obtained; I am adorned
        and embellished by the True Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||   O my
        mind, remain awake and aware night and day, and think of the Lord.
        Protect your crops, or else the birds shall descend on your farm.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The desires of the mind are fulfilled, when
        one is filled to overflowing with the Shabad. One who fears, loves,
        and is devoted to the Dear Lord day and night, sees Him always
        close at hand. Doubt runs far away from the bodies of those, whose
        minds remain forever attuned to the True Word of the Shabad. The
        Immaculate Lord and Master is found. He is True; He is the Ocean
        of Excellence.  || 2 ||   Those who remain awake and aware are
        saved, while those who sleep are plundered. They do not recognize
        the True Word of the Shabad, and like a dream, their lives fade
        away. </p>

      <p> Like guests in a deserted house, they leave just exactly as they
        have come. The life of the self-willed manmukh passes uselessly.
        What face will he show when he passes beyond?  || 3 ||   God Himself
        is everything; those who are in their ego cannot even speak of
        this. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized,
        and the pain of egotism is eradicated from within. I fall at the
        feet of those who serve their True Guru. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice
        to those who are found to be true in the True Court.  || 4 ||
        21 || 54 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Consider the time and
        the moment - when should we worship the Lord? Night and day,
        one who is attuned to the Name of the True Lord is true. If someone
        forgets the Beloved Lord, even for an instant, what sort of devotion
        is that? One whose mind and body are cooled and soothed by the
        True Lord - no breath of his is wasted.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        meditate on the Name of the Lord. True devotional worship is performed
        when the Lord comes to dwell in the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        With intuitive ease, cultivate your farm, and plant the Seed
        of the True Name. The seedlings have sprouted luxuriantly, and
        with intuitive ease, the mind is satisfied. The Word of the Guru's
        Shabad is Ambrosial Nectar; drinking it in, thirst is quenched.
        This true mind is attuned to Truth, and it remains permeated with
        the True One.  || 2 ||   In speaking, in seeing and in words,
        remain immersed in the Shabad. The Word of the Guru's Bani
        vibrates throughout the four ages. As Truth, it teaches Truth.
        Egotism and possessiveness are eliminated, and the True One absorbs
        them into Himself. Those who remain lovingly absorbed in the True
        One see the Mansion of His Presence close at hand.  || 3 ||  
        By His Grace, we meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Without
        His Mercy, it cannot be obtained. Through perfect good destiny,
        one finds the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and one comes
        to meet the True Guru. Night and day, remain attuned to the Naam,
        and the pain of corruption shall be dispelled from within. O Nanak,
        merging with the Shabad through the Name, one is immersed in the
        Name.  || 4 || 22 || 55 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who
        contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad are filled with
        the Fear of God. They remain forever merged with the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation; they dwell upon the Glories of the True
        One. They cast off the filth of their mental duality, and they
        keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts. True is their speech,
        and true are their minds. They are in love with the True One.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, you are filled with the filth of egotism.
        The Immaculate Lord is eternally Beautiful. We are adorned with
        the Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God joins to Himself
        those whose minds are fascinated with the True Word of His Shabad.
        Night and day, they are attuned to the Naam, and their light is
        absorbed into the Light. Through His Light, God is revealed. Without
        the True Guru, understanding is not obtained. The True Guru comes
        to meet those who have such pre-ordained destiny.  || 2 ||   Without
        the Name, all are miserable. In the love of duality, they are
        ruined. Without Him, I cannot survive even for an instant, and
        my life-night passes in anguish. Wandering in doubt, the spiritually
        blind come and go in reincarnation, over and over again. </p>

      <p> When God Himself bestows His Glance of Grace, He blends us into
        Himself.  || 3 ||   He hears and sees everything. How can anyone
        deny Him? Those who sin again and again, shall rot and die in
        sin. God's Glance of Grace does not come to them; those self-willed
        manmukhs do not obtain understanding. They alone see the Lord,
        unto whom He reveals Himself. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs find Him.
        || 4 || 23 || 56 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Without the Guru,
        the disease is not cured, and the pain of egotism is not removed.
        By Guru's Grace, He dwells in the mind, and one remains immersed
        in His Name. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord
        is found; without the Shabad, people wander, deceived by doubt.
        || 1 ||   O mind, dwell in the balanced state of your own inner
        being. Praise the Lord's Name, and you shall no longer come
        and go in reincarnation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One Lord alone
        is the Giver, pervading everywhere. There is no other at all.
        Praise the Word of the Shabad, and He shall come to dwell in your
        mind; you shall be blessed with intuitive peace and poise. Everything
        is within the Lord's Glance of Grace. As He wishes, He gives.
        || 2 ||   In egotism, all must account for their actions. In
        this accounting, there is no peace. Acting in evil and corruption,
        people are immersed in corruption. Without the Name, they find
        no place of rest. In the City of Death, they suffer in agony.
        || 3 ||   Body and soul all belong to Him; He is the Support
        of all. By Guru's Grace, understanding comes, and then the
        Door of Liberation is found. O Nanak, sing the Praises of the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord; He has no end or limitation.  || 4
        || 24 || 57 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who have the
        Support of the True Name are in ecstasy and peace forever. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they obtain the True One,
        the Destroyer of pain. Forever and ever, they sing the Glorious
        Praises of the True One; they love the True Name. When the Lord
        Himself grants His Grace, He bestows the treasure of devotion.
        || 1 ||   O mind, sing His Glorious Praises, and be in ecstasy
        forever. Through the True Word of His Bani, the Lord is obtained,
        and one remains immersed in the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In
        true devotion, the mind is dyed in the deep crimson color of the
        Lord's Love, with intuitive peace and poise. The mind is
        fascinated by the Word of the Guru's Shabad, which cannot
        be described. The tongue imbued with the True Word of the Shabad
        drinks in the Amrit with delight, singing His Glorious Praises.
        The Gurmukh obtains this love, when the Lord, in His Will, grants
        His Grace.  || 2 ||   This world is an illusion; people pass their
        life-nights sleeping. By the Pleasure of His Will, He lifts some
        out, and unites them with Himself. He Himself abides in the mind,
        and drives out attachment to Maya. He Himself bestows glorious
        greatness; He inspires the Gurmukh to understand.  || 3 ||   The
        One Lord is the Giver of all. He corrects those who make mistakes.
        He Himself has deceived some, and attached them to duality. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, the Lord is found, and one's light
        merges into the Light. Attuned to the Name of the Lord night and
        day, O Nanak, you shall be absorbed into the Name.  || 4 || 25

      <p> Their minds are imbued with the Word of the Guru's Shabad;
        the Love of their Beloved is on their tongues. Without the True
        Guru, no one has found Him; reflect upon this in your mind and
        see. The filth of the self-willed manmukhs is not washed off;
        they have no love for the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||   O my
        mind, walk in harmony with the True Guru. Dwell within the home
        of your own inner being, and drink in the Ambrosial Nectar; you
        shall attain the Peace of the Mansion of His Presence.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The unvirtuous have no merit; they are not allowed
        to sit in His Presence. The self-willed manmukhs do not know the
        Shabad; those without virtue are far removed from God. Those who
        recognize the True One are permeated and attuned to Truth. Their
        minds are pierced through by the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        and God Himself ushers them into His Presence.  || 2 ||   He Himself
        dyes us in the Color of His Love; through the Word of His Shabad,
        He unites us with Himself. This True Color shall not fade away,
        for those who are attuned to His Love. The self-willed manmukhs
        grow weary of wandering around in all four directions, but they
        do not understand. One who is united with the True Guru, meets
        and merges in the True Word of the Shabad.  || 3 ||   I have grown
        weary of making so many friends, hoping that someone might be
        able to end my suffering. Meeting with my Beloved, my suffering
        has ended; I have attained Union with the Word of the Shabad.
        Earning Truth, and accumulating the Wealth of Truth, the truthful
        person gains a reputation of Truth. Meeting with the True One,
        O Nanak, the Gurmukh shall not be separated from Him again.  ||
        4 || 26 || 59 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  The Creator Himself
        created the Creation; He produced the Universe, and He Himself
        watches over it. The One and Only Lord is pervading and permeating
        all. The Unseen cannot be seen. God Himself is Merciful; He Himself
        bestows understanding. Through the Guru's Teachings, the True
        One dwells forever in the mind of those who remain lovingly attached
        to Him.  || 1 ||   O my mind, surrender to the Guru's Will.
        Mind and body are totally cooled and soothed, and the Naam comes
        to dwell in the mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Having created the
        creation, He supports it and takes care of it. The Word of the
        Guru's Shabad is realized, when He Himself bestows His Glance
        of Grace. Those who are beautifully adorned with the Shabad in
        the Court of the True Lord - those Gurmukhs are attuned to
        the True Word of the Shabad; the Creator unites them with Himself.
        || 2 ||   Through the Guru's Teachings, praise the True One,
        who has no end or limitation. He dwells in each and every heart,
        by the Hukam of His Command; by His Hukam, we contemplate Him.
        So praise Him through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and
        drive out egotism from within. That soul-bride who lacks the Lord's
        Name acts without virtue, and so she grieves.  || 3 ||   Praising
        the True One, attached to the True One, I am satisfied with the
        True Name. Contemplating His Virtues, I accumulate virtue and
        merit; I wash myself clean of demerits. He Himself unites us in
        His Union; there is no more separation. O Nanak, I sing the Praises
        of my Guru; through Him, I find that God.  || 4 || 27 || 60 ||
        SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  Listen, listen, O soul-bride: you
        are overtaken by sexual desire - why do you walk like that,
        swinging your arms in joy? You do not recognize your own Husband
        Lord! When you go to Him, what face will you show Him? I touch
        the feet of my sister soul-brides who have known their Husband
        Lord. </p>

      <p> If only I could be like them! Joining the Sat Sangat, the True
        Congregation, I am united in His Union.  || 1 ||   O woman, the
        false ones are being cheated by falsehood. God is your Husband;
        He is Handsome and True. He is obtained by reflecting upon the
        Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukhs do not recognize
        their Husband Lord; how will they spend their life-night? Filled
        with arrogance, they burn with desire; they suffer in the pain
        of the love of duality. The happy soul-brides are attuned to the
        Shabad; their egotism is eliminated from within. They enjoy their
        Husband Lord forever, and their life-night passes in the most
        blissful peace.  || 2 ||   She is utterly lacking in spiritual
        wisdom; she is abandoned by her Husband Lord. She cannot obtain
        His Love. In the darkness of intellectual ignorance, she cannot
        see her Husband, and her hunger does not depart. Come and meet
        with me, my sister soul-brides, and unite me with my Husband.
        She who meets the True Guru, by perfect good fortune, finds her
        Husband; she is absorbed in the True One.  || 3 ||   Those upon
        whom He casts His Glance of Grace become His happy soul-brides.
        One who recognizes her Lord and Master places her body and mind
        in offering before Him. Within her own home, she finds her Husband
        Lord; her egotism is dispelled. O Nanak, the happy soul-brides
        are embellished and exalted; night and day they are absorbed in
        devotional worship.  || 4 || 28 || 61 ||   SIREE RAAG,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Some enjoy their Husband Lord; unto whose door should I
        go to ask for Him? I serve my True Guru with love, that He may
        lead me to Union with my Husband Lord. He created all, and He
        Himself watches over us. Some are close to Him, and some are far
        away. She who knows her Husband Lord to be always with her, enjoys
        His Constant Presence.  || 1 ||   O woman, you must walk in harmony
        with the Guru's Will. Night and day, you shall enjoy your
        Husband, and you shall intuitively merge into the True One.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Attuned to the Shabad, the happy soul-brides
        are adorned with the True Word of the Shabad. Within their own
        home, they obtain the Lord as their Husband, with love for the
        Guru. Upon her beautiful and cozy bed, she enjoys the Love of
        her Lord. She is overflowing with the treasure of devotion. That
        Beloved God abides in her mind; He gives His Support to all. 
        || 2 ||   I am forever a sacrifice to those who praise their Husband
        Lord. I dedicate my mind and body to them, and give my head as
        well; I fall at their feet. Those who recognize the One renounce
        the love of duality. The Gurmukh recognizes the Naam, O Nanak,
        and is absorbed into the True One.  || 3 || 29 || 62 ||   SIREE
        RAAG,  THIRD MEHL:  O Dear Lord, You are the Truest of the True.
        All things are in Your Power. The 8.4 million species of beings
        wander around searching for You, but without the Guru, they do
        not find You. When the Dear Lord grants His Forgiveness, this
        human body finds lasting peace. By Guru's Grace, I serve
        the True One, who is Immeasurably Deep and Profound.  || 1 ||
        O my mind, attuned to the Naam, you shall find peace. Follow
        the Guru's Teachings, and praise the Naam; there is no other
        at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Righteous Judge of Dharma, by
        the Hukam of God's Command, sits and administers True Justice.
        Those evil souls, ensnared by the love of duality, are subject
        to Your Command. </p>

      <p> The souls on their spiritual journey chant and meditate within
        their minds on the One Lord, the Treasure of Excellence. The Righteous
        Judge of Dharma serves them; blessed is the Lord who adorns them.
        || 2 ||   One who eliminates mental wickedness from within the
        mind, and casts out emotional attachment and egotistical pride,
        comes to recognize the All-pervading Soul, and is intuitively
        absorbed into the Naam. Without the True Guru, the self-willed
        manmukhs do not find liberation; they wander around like lunatics.
        They do not contemplate the Shabad; engrossed in corruption, they
        utter only empty words.  || 3 ||   He Himself is everything; there
        is no other at all. I speak just as He makes me speak, when He
        Himself makes me speak. The Word of the Gurmukh is God Himself.
        Through the Shabad, we merge in Him. O Nanak, remember the Naam;
        serving Him, peace is obtained.  || 4 || 30 || 63 ||   SIREE RAAG,
        THIRD MEHL:  The world is polluted with the filth of egotism,
        suffering in pain. This filth sticks to them because of their
        love of duality. This filth of egotism cannot be washed away,
        even by taking cleansing baths at hundreds of sacred shrines.
        Performing all sorts of rituals, people are smeared with twice
        as much filth. This filth is not removed by studying. Go ahead,
        and ask the wise ones.  || 1 ||   O my mind, coming to the Sanctuary
        of the Guru, you shall become immaculate and pure. The self-willed
        manmukhs have grown weary of chanting the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, but their filth cannot be removed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        With a polluted mind, devotional service cannot be performed,
        and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, cannot be obtained. The filthy,
        self-willed manmukhs die in filth, and they depart in disgrace.
        By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to abide in the mind, and
        the filth of egotism is dispelled. Like a lamp lit in the darkness,
        the spiritual wisdom of the Guru dispels ignorance.  || 2 || 
        &quot;I have done this, and I will do that&quot; - I am an
        idiotic fool for saying this! I have forgotten the Doer of all;
        I am caught in the love of duality. There is no pain as great
        as the pain of Maya; it drives people to wander all around the
        world, until they become exhausted. Through the Guru's Teachings,
        peace is found, with the True Name enshrined in the heart.  ||
        3 ||   I am a sacrifice to those who meet and merge with the Lord.
        This mind is attuned to devotional worship; through the True Word
        of Gurbani, it finds its own home. With the mind so imbued, and
        the tongue imbued as well, sing the Glorious Praises of the True
        Lord. O Nanak, never forget the Naam; immerse yourself in the
        True One.  || 4 || 31 || 64 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FOURTH MEHL,  FIRST
        HOUSE:  Within my mind and body is the intense pain of separation;
        how can my Beloved come to meet me in my home? When I see my God,
        seeing God Himself, my pain is taken away. I go and ask my friends,
  &quot;How can I meet and merge with God?&quot;  || 1 ||   O my
        True Guru, without You I have no other at all. I am foolish and
        ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary. Please be Merciful and unite
        me with the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The True Guru is the Giver
        of the Name of the Lord. God Himself causes us to meet Him. The
        True Guru understands the Lord God. There is no other as Great
        as the Guru. I have come and collapsed in the Guru's Sanctuary.
        In His Kindness, He has united me with God.  || 2 || <br>
