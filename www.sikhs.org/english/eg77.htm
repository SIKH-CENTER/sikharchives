      <p> <font color="#000000">You are the Emperor, and I call You a chief
        - how does this add to Your greatness? As You permit me,
        I praise You, O Lord and Master; I am ignorant, and I cannot chant
        Your Praises.  || 1 ||   Please bless me with such understanding,
        that I may sing Your Glorious Praises. May I dwell in Truth, according
        to Your Will.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever has happened, has
        all come from You. You are All-knowing. Your limits cannot be
        known, O my Lord and Master; I am blind - what wisdom do
        I have?  || 2 ||   What should I say? While talking, I talk of
        seeing, but I cannot describe the indescribable. As it pleases
        Your Will, I speak; it is just the tiniest bit of Your greatness.
        || 3 ||   Among so many dogs, I am an outcast; I bark for my
        body's belly. Without devotional worship, O Nanak, even
        so, still, my Master's Name does not leave me.  || 4 ||
        1 ||   BILAAWAL,  FIRST MEHL:  My mind is the temple, and my body
        is the simple cloth of the humble seeker; deep within my heart,
        I bathe at the sacred shrine. The One Word of the Shabad abides
        within my mind; I shall not come to be born again.  || 1 ||  
        My mind is pierced through by the Merciful Lord, O my mother!
        Who can know the pain of another? I think of none other than the
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Lord, inaccessible, unfathomable,
        invisible and infinite:  please, take care of me! In the water,
        on the land and in sky, You are totally pervading. Your Light
        is in each and every heart.  || 2 ||   All teachings, instructions
        and understandings are Yours; the mansions and sanctuaries are
        Yours as well. Without You, I know no other, O my Lord and Master;
        I continually sing Your Glorious Praises.  || 3 ||   All beings
        and creatures seek the Protection of Your Sanctuary; all thought
        of their care rests with You. That which pleases Your Will is
        good; this alone is Nanak's prayer.  || 4 || 2 ||   BILAAWAL,
        FIRST MEHL:  He Himself is the Word of the Shabad, and He Himself
        is the Insignia. He Himself is the Listener, and He Himself is
        the Knower. He Himself created the creation, and He Himself beholds
        His almighty power. <br>

      </p>
      <p> You are the Great Giver; Your Name alone is approved.  || 1 ||
        Such is the Name of the Immaculate, Divine Lord. I am just a
        beggar; You are invisible and unknowable.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Love of Maya is like a cursed woman, ugly, dirty and promiscuous.
        Power and beauty are false, and last for only a few days. But
        when one is blessed with the Naam, the darkness within is illuminated.
        || 2 ||   I tasted Maya and renounced it, and now, I have no
        doubts. One whose father is known, cannot be illegitimate. One
        who belongs to the One Lord, has no fear. The Creator acts, and
        causes all to act. One who dies in the Word of the Shabad conquers
        his mind, through his mind. Keeping his mind restrained, he enshrines
        the True Lord within his heart. He does not know any other, and
        he is a sacrifice to the Guru. O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, he
        is emancipated.  || 4 || 3 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIRST MEHL:  Through
        the Word of the Guru's Teachings, the mind intuitively
        meditates on the Lord. Imbued with the Lord's Love, the
        mind is satisfied. The insane, self-willed manmukhs wander around,
        deluded by doubt. Without the Lord, how can anyone survive? Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized.  || 1 ||
        Without the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, how can I live, O
        my mother? Without the Lord, my soul cannot survive, even for
        an instant; the True Guru has helped me understand this.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Forgetting my God, I die in pain. With each breath
        and morsel of food, I meditate on my Lord, and seek Him. I remain
        always detached, but I am enraptured with the Lord's Name.
        Now, as Gurmukh, I know that the Lord is always with me.  || 2
        ||   The Unspoken Speech is spoken, by the Will of the Guru. He
        shows us that God is unapproachable and unfathomable. Without
        the Guru, what lifestyle could we practice, and what work could
        we do? Eradicating egotism, and walking in harmony with the Guru's
        Will, I am absorbed in the Word of the Shabad.  || 3 ||   The
        self-willed manmukhs are separated from the Lord, gathering false
        wealth. The Gurmukhs are celebrated with the glory of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. The Lord has showered His Mercy upon me,
        and made me the slave of His slaves. The Name of the Lord is the
        wealth and capital of servant Nanak.  || 4 || 4 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Cursed, cursed is the food; cursed, cursed
        is the sleep; cursed, cursed are the clothes worn on the body.
        Cursed is the body, along with family and friends, when one does
        not find his Lord and Master in this life. He misses the step
        of the ladder, and this opportunity will not come into his hands
        again; his life is wasted, uselessly.  || 1 ||   The love of duality
        does not allow him to lovingly focus his attention on the Lord;
        he forgets the Feet of the Lord. O Life of the World, O Great
        Giver, you eradicate the sorrows of your humble servants. || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   You are Merciful, O Great Giver of Mercy; what
        are these poor beings? All are liberated or placed into bondage
        by You; this is all one can say. One who becomes Gurmukh is said
        to be liberated, while the poor self-willed manmukhs are in bondage.
        || 2 ||   He alone is liberated, who lovingly focuses his attention
        on the One Lord, always dwelling with the Lord. His depth and
        condition cannot be described. The True Lord Himself embellishes
        him. <br>

      <p> Those who wander around, deluded by doubt, are called manmukhs;
        they are neither on this side, nor on the other side.  || 3 ||
        That humble being, who is blessed by the Lord's Glance
        of Grace obtains Him, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. In the midst of Maya, the Lord's servant is emancipated.
        O Nanak, one who has such destiny inscribed upon his forehead,
        conquers and destroys death.  || 4 || 1 ||   BILAAVAL,  THIRD
        MEHL:  How can the unweighable be weighed? If there is anyone
        else as great, then he alone could understand the Lord. There
        is no other than Him. How can His value be estimated?  || 1 ||
        By Guru's Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind. One comes
        to know Him, when duality departs.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself
        is the Assayer, applying the touch-stone to test it. He Himself
        analyzes the coin, and He Himself approves it as currency. He
        Himself weights it perfectly. He alone knows; He is the One and
        Only Lord.  || 2 ||   All the forms of Maya emanate from Him.
        He alone becomes pure and immaculate, who is united with the Lord.
        He alone is attached, whom the Lord attaches. All Truth is revealed
        to him, and then, he merges in the True Lord.  || 3 ||   He Himself
        leads the mortals to focus on Him, and He Himself causes them
        to chase after Maya. He Himself imparts understanding, and He
        reveals Himself. He Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is
        the Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, He Himself speaks and teaches.
        || 4 || 2 ||    BILAAVAL,  THIRD MEHL:  My Lord and Master has
        made me His servant, and blessed me with His service; how can
        anyone argue about this? Such is Your play, One and Only Lord;
        You are the One, contained among all.  || 1 ||   When the True
        Guru is pleased and appeased, one is absorbed in the Lord's
        Name. One who is blessed by the Lord's Mercy, finds the
        True Guru; night and day, he automatically remains focused on
        the Lord's meditation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   How can I
        serve You? How can I be proud of this? When You withdraw Your
        Light, O Lord and Master, then who can speak and teach?  || 2
        ||   You Yourself are the Guru, and You Yourself are the chaylaa,
        the humble disciple; You Yourself are the treasure of virtue.
        As You cause us to move, so do we move, according to the Pleasure
        of Your Will, O Lord God.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, You are the True
        Lord and Master; who can know Your actions? Some are blessed with
        glory in their own homes, while others wander in doubt and pride.
        || 4 || 3 ||   BILAAVAL,  THIRD MEHL:  The perfect Lord has fashioned
        the Perfect Creation. Behold the Lord Lord pervading everywhere.
        In this play of the world, is the glorious greatness of the True
        Name. No one should take pride in himself.  || 1 ||   One who
        accepts the wisdom of the True Guru's Teachings, is absorbed
        into the True Guru. The Lord's Name abides deep within
        the nucleus of one who realizes the Bani of the Guru's
        Word within his soul.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Now, this is the essence
        of the teachings of the four ages: for the human race, the Name
        of the One Lord is the greatest treasure. Celibacy, self-discipline
        and pilgrimages were the essence of Dharma in those past ages;
        but in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Praise of the Lord's
        Name is the essence of Dharma.  || 2 ||   Each and every age has
        its own essence of Dharma; study the Vedas and the Puraanas, and
        see this as true. They are Gurmukh, who meditate on the Lord,
        Har, Har; in this world, they are perfect and approved. <br>

      <p> Says Nanak, loving the True Lord, the mind's egotism and
        self-conceit is eradicated. Those who speak and listen to the
        Lord's Name, all find peace. Those who believe in it, obtain
        the supreme treasure.  || 4 || 4 ||   BILAAVAL,  THIRD MEHL: 
        The Lord Himself attaches the Gurmukh to His Love; joyful melodies
        permeate his home, and he is embellished with the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad. The women come and sing the songs of joy.
        Meeting with their Beloved, lasting peace is obtained.  || 1 ||
        I am a sacrifice to those, whose minds are filled with the Lord.
        Meeting with the humble servant of the Lord, peace is obtained,
        and one intuitively sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   They are always imbued with Your Joyful Love;
        O Dear Lord, You Yourself come to dwell in their minds. They obtain
        eternal glory. The Gurmukhs are united in the Lord's Union.
        || 2 ||   The Gurmukhs are imbued with the love of the Word of
        the Shabad. They abide in the home of their own being, singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. They are dyed in the deep crimson
        color of the Lord's Love; they look so beautiful. This
        dye never fades away; they are absorbed in the True Lord.  ||
        3 ||   The Shabad deep within the nucleus of the self dispels
        the darkness of ignorance. Meeting with my Friend, the True Guru,
        I have obtained spiritual wisdom. Those who are attuned to the
        True Lord, do not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation again.
        O Nanak, my Perfect Guru implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        deep within.  || 4 || 5 ||   BILAAVAL,  THIRD MEHL:  From the
        Perfect Guru, I have obtained glorious greatness. The Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, has spontaneously come to abide in my mind.
        Through the Word of the Shabad, I have burnt away egotism and
        Maya. Through the Guru, I have obtained honor in the Court of
        the True Lord.  || 1 ||   I serve the Lord of the Universe; I
        have no other work to do. Night and day, my mind is in ecstasy;
        as Gurmukh, I beg for the bliss-giving Naam.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   From the mind itself, mental faith is obtained. Through the
        Guru, I have realized the Shabad. How rare is that person, who
        looks upon life and death alike. She shall never die again, and
        shall not have to see the Messenger of Death.  || 2 ||   Within
        the home of the self are all the millions of treasures. The True
        Guru has revealed them, and my egotistical pride is gone. I keep
        my meditation always focused on the Cosmic Lord. Night and day,
        I sing the One Name.  || 3 ||   I have obtained glorious greatness
        in this age, from the Perfect Guru, meditating on the Naam. Wherever
        I look, I see the Lord permeating and pervading. He is forever
        the Giver of peace; His worth cannot be estimated.  || 4 ||  
        By perfect destiny, I have found the Perfect Guru. He has revealed
        to me the treasure of the Naam, deep within the nucleus of my
        self. The Word of the Guru's Shabad is so very sweet. O
        Nanak, my thirst is quenched, and my mind and body have found
        peace.  || 5 || 6 || 4 || 6 || 10 || <br>

        I am a lowly stone, with no good karma at all.  || 1 ||   O my
        mind, vibrate and meditate on the Lord, the Name of the Lord.
        Under Guru's Instructions, obtain the sublime, subtle essence
        of the Lord; renounce other fruitless actions.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The humble servants of the Lord are saved by the Lord; I
        am worthless - it is Your glory to save me. I have no other
        than You, O my Lord and Master; I meditate on the Lord, by my
        good karma.  || 2 ||   Those who lack the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, their lives are cursed, and they must endure terrible pain.
        They are consigned to reincarnation over and over again; they
        are the most unfortunate fools, with no good karma at all.  ||
        3 ||   The Naam is the Support of the Lord's humble servants;
        their good karma is pre-ordained. The Guru, the True Guru, has
        implanted the Naam within servant Nanak, and his life is fruitful.
        || 4 || 2 ||   BILAAVAL,  FOURTH MEHL:  My consciousness is lured
        by emotional attachment and corruption; is is filled with evil-minded
        filth. I cannot serve You, O God; I am ignorant - how can
        I cross over?  || 1 ||   O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord,
        the Lord, the Lord of man. God has showered His Mercy upon His
        humble servant; meeting with the True Guru, he is carried across.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O my Father, my Lord and Master, Lord God,
        please bless me with such understanding, that I may sing Your
        Praises. Those who are attached to You are saved, like iron which
        is carried across with wood.  || 2 ||   The faithless cynics have
        little or no understanding; they do not serve the Lord, Har, Har.
        Those beings are unfortunate and vicious; they die, and are consigned
        to reincarnation, over and over again.  || 3 ||   Those whom You
        unite with Yourself, O Lord and Master, bathe in the Guru's
        cleansing pool of contentment. Vibrating upon the Lord, the filth
        of their evil-mindedness is washed away; servant Nanak is carried
        across.  || 4 || 3 ||   BILAAVAL,  FOURTH MEHL:  Come, O Saints,
        and join together, O my Siblings of Destiny; let us tell the Stories
        of the Lord, Har, Har. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the
        boat in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad is the boatman to ferry us across.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord. <br>

      <p> According to the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon your forehead,
        sing the Praises of the Lord; join the Holy Congregation, and
        cross over the world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Within the body-village
        is the Lord's supreme, sublime essence. How can I obtain
        it? Teach me, O humble Saints. Serving the True Guru, you shall
        obtain the Fruitful Vision of the Lord's Darshan; meeting
        Him, drink in the ambrosial essence of the Lord's Nectar.
        || 2 ||   The Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is so sweet;
        O Saints of the Lord, taste it, and see. Under Guru's Instruction,
        the Lord's essence seems so sweet; through it, all corrupt
        sensual pleasures are forgotten.  || 3 ||   The Name of the Lord
        is the medicine to cure all diseases; so serve the Lord, O humble
        Saints. The four great blessings are obtained, O Nanak, by vibrating
        upon the Lord, under Guru's Instruction.  || 4 || 4 ||
        BILAAVAL,  FOURTH MEHL:  Anyone, from any class - Kh'shaatriya,
        Brahman, Soodra or Vaishya - can chant, and meditate on
        the Mantra of the Lord's Name. Worship the Guru, the True
        Guru, as the Supreme Lord God; serve Him constantly, all day and
        night.  || 1 ||   O humble servants of the Lord, behold the True
        Guru with your eyes. Whatever you wish for, you shall receive,
        chanting the Word of the Lord's Name, under Guru's
        Instruction.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   People think of many and various
        efforts, but that alone happens, which is to happen. All beings
        seek goodness for themselves, but what the Lord does -
        that may not be what we think and expect.  || 2 ||   So renounce
        the clever intellect of your mind, O humble servants of the Lord,
        no matter how hard this may be. Night and day, meditate on the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; accept the wisdom of the
        Guru, the True Guru.  || 3 ||   Wisdom, balanced wisdom is in
        Your power, O Lord and Master; I am the instrument, and You are
        the player, O Primal Lord. O God, O Creator, Lord and Master of
        servant Nanak, as You wish, so do I speak.  || 4 || 5 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FOURTH MEHL:  I meditate on the source of bliss, the Sublime
        Primal Being; night and day, I am in ecstasy and bliss. The Righteous
        Judge of Dharma has no power over me; I have cast off all subservience
        to the Messenger of Death.  || 1 ||   Meditate, O mind, on the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe. By great good fortune,
        I have found the Guru, the True Guru; I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord of supreme bliss.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The foolish
        faithless cynics are held captive by Maya; in Maya, they continue
        wandering, wandering around. Burnt by desire, and bound by the
        karma of their past actions, they go round and round, like the
        ox at the mill press.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukhs, who focus on serving
        the Guru, are saved; by great good fortune, they perform service.
        Those who meditate on the Lord obtain the fruits of their rewards,
        and the bonds of Maya are all broken.  || 3 ||   He Himself is
        the Lord and Master, and He Himself is the servant. The Lord of
        the Universe Himself is all by Himself. O servant Nanak, He Himself
        is All-pervading; as He keeps us, we remain.  || 4 || 6 || <br>

        this nectar, all have drowned, and their souls have not found

      <p> O Nanak, they alone look beautiful in the Court of the Lord, whom
        the Lord has made His Own.  || 1 ||   Maya is a mirage, which
        deludes the mind, O my companion, like the scent-crazed deer,
        or the transitory shade of a tree. Maya is fickle, and does not
        go with you, O my companion; in the end, it will leave you. He
        may enjoy pleasures and sensual delights with supremely beautiful
        women, but no one finds peace in this way. Blessed, blessed are
        the humble, Holy Saints of the Lord, O my companion. O Nanak,

        and merge with the Lord. There, neither pain nor hunger nor disease
        will afflict you; enshrine love for the Lord's Lotus Feet.
        There is no birth or death there, no coming or going in reincarnation,
        when you enter the Sanctuary of the Eternal Lord. Love does not
        end, and attachment does not grip you, O Nanak, when you meditate
        on the One Lord.  || 3 ||   Bestowing His Glance of Grace, my

      <p> The Beloved Feet of the Guru abide within my heart.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   The mind is engrossed in sexual desire, anger, greed
        and emotional attachment. Breaking my bonds, the Guru has liberated
        me.  || 2 ||   Experiencing pain and pleasure, one is born, only
        to die again. The Lotus Feet of the Guru bring peace and shelter.
        || 3 ||   The world is drowning in the ocean of fire. O Nanak,
        holding me by the arm, the True Guru has saved me.  || 4 || 3
        || 8 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Body, mind, wealth and everything,
        I surrender to my Lord. What is that wisdom, by which I may come
        to chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har?  || 1 ||   Nurturing
        hope, I have come to beg from God. Gazing upon You, the courtyard
        of my heart is embellished.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Trying several
        methods, I reflect deeply upon the Lord. In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, this mind is saved.  || 2 ||   I have
        neither intelligence, wisdom, common sense nor cleverness. I meet
        You, only if You lead me to meet You.  || 3 ||   My eyes are content,
        gazing upon the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan. Says Nanak,
        such a life is fruitful and rewarding.  || 4 || 4 || 9 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Mother, father, children and the wealth of Maya,
        will not go along with you. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, all pain is dispelled.  || 1 ||   God Himself is pervading,
        and permeating all. Chant the Name of the Lord with your tongue,
        and pain will not afflict you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who is
        afflicted by the terrible fire of thirst and desire, becomes cool,
        chanting the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 2 ||   By millions
        of efforts, peace is not obtained; the mind is satisfied only
        by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Please
        bless me with devotion, O God, O Searcher of hearts. This is Nanak's
        prayer, O Lord and Master.  || 4 || 5 || 10 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  By great good fortune, the Perfect Guru is found. Meeting
        with the Holy Saints, meditate on the Name of the Lord.  || 1
        ||   O Supreme Lord God, I seek Your Sanctuary. Meditating on
        the Guru's Feet, sinful mistakes are erased.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   All other rituals are just worldly affairs; joining
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one is saved.  || 2
        ||   One may contemplate the Simritees, Shaastras and Vedas, but
        only by chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is one saved
        and carried across.  || 3 ||   Have Mercy upon servant Nanak,
        O God, and bless him with the dust of the feet of the Holy, that
        he may be emancipated.  || 4 || 6 || 11 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  I contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad within
        my heart; all my hopes and desires are fulfilled. The faces of
        the humble Saints are radiant and bright; the Lord has mercifully
        blessed them with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Holding them by the hand, He has lifted them up out of the
        deep, dark pit, and their victory is celebrated throughout the
        world.  || 2 ||   He elevates and exalts the lowly, and fills
        the empty. They receive the supreme, sublime essence of the Ambrosial
        Naam.  || 3 ||   The mind and body are made immaculate and pure,
        and sins are burnt to ashes. Says Nanak, God is pleased with me.
        || 4 || 7 || 12 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  All desires are
        fulfilled, O my friend, lovingly centering your consciousness
        on the Lord's Lotus Feet. <br>

      <p> || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on God. The fire
        of desire is quenched, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One's life become fruitful
        and rewarding, by great good fortune. In the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, enshrine love for the Lord.  || 2 ||   Wisdom,
        honor, wealth, peace and celestial bliss are attained, if one
        does not forget the Lord of supreme bliss, even for an instant.
        || 3 ||   My mind is so very thirsty for the Blessed Vision of
        the Lord's Darshan. Prays Nanak, O God, I seek Your Sanctuary.
        || 4 || 8 || 13 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  I am worthless,
        totally lacking all virtues. Bless me with Your Mercy, and make
        me Your Own.  || 1 ||   My mind and body are embellished by the
        Lord, the Lord of the World. Granting His Mercy, God has come
        into the home of my heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is the Lover
        and Protector of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear. Now, I have
        been carried across the world-ocean.  || 2 ||   It is God's
        Way to purify sinners, say the Vedas. I have seen the Supreme
        Lord with my eyes.  || 3 ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, the Lord becomes manifest. O slave Nanak, all pains
        are relieved.  || 4 || 9 || 14 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Who
        can know the value of serving You, God? God is imperishable, invisible
        and incomprehensible.  || 1 ||   His Glorious Virtues are infinite;
        God is profound and unfathomable. The Mansion of God, my Lord
        and Master, is lofty and high. You are unlimited, O my Lord and
        Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There is no other than the One Lord.
        You alone know Your worship and adoration.  || 2 ||   No one can
        do anything by himself, O Siblings of Destiny. He alone obtains
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, unto whom God bestows it.  ||
        3 ||   Says Nanak, that humble being who pleases God, he alone
        finds God, the treasure of virtue.  || 4 || 10 || 15 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Extending His Hand, the Lord protected you in your
        mother's womb. Renouncing the sublime essence of the Lord,
        you have tasted the fruit of poison.  || 1 ||   Meditate, vibrate
        on the Lord of the Universe, and renounce all entanglements. When
        the Messenger of Death comes to murder you, O fool, then your
        body will be shattered and helplessly crumble.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   You hold onto your body, mind and wealth as your own, and
        you do not meditate on the Creator Lord, even for an instant.
        || 2 ||   You have fallen into the deep, dark pit of great attachment.
        Caught in the illusion of Maya, you have forgotten the Supreme
        Lord.  || 3 ||   By great good fortune, one sings the Kirtan of
        God's Praises. In the Society of the Saints, Nanak has
        found God.  || 4 || 11 || 16 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Mother,
        father, children, relatives and siblings - O Nanak, the
        Supreme Lord is our help and support.  || 1 ||   He blesses us
        with peace, and abundant celestial bliss. Perfect is the Bani,
        the Word of the Perfect Guru. His Virtues are so many, they cannot
        be counted.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God Himself makes all arrangements.
        Meditating on God, desires are fulfilled.  || 2 ||   He is the
        Giver of wealth, Dharmic faith, pleasure and liberation. </p>
