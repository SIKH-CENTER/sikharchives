      <p> O Nanak, whatever the Gurmukhs do is acceptable; they remain lovingly
        absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        I am a sacrifice to those Sikhs who are Gurmukhs. I behold the
        Blessed Vision, the Darshan of those who meditate on the Lord's
        Name. Listening to the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, I contemplate
        His virtues; I write His Praises on the fabric of my mind. I praise
        the Lord's Name with love, and eradicate all my sins. Blessed,
        blessed and beauteous is that body and place, where my Guru places
        His feet.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Without the Guru,
        spiritual wisdom is not obtained, and peace does not come to abide
        in the mind. O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        the self-willed manmukhs depart, after having wasted their lives.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  All the Siddhas, spiritual masters and
        seekers search for the Name; they have grown weary of concentrating
        and focusing their attention. Without the True Guru, no one finds
        the Name; the Gurmukhs unite in Union with the Lord. Without the
        Name, all food and clothes are worthless; cursed is such spirituality,
        and cursed are such miraculous powers. That alone is spirituality,
        and that alone is miraculous power, which the Carefree Lord spontaneously
        bestows. O Nanak, the Lord's Name abides in the mind of the
        Gurmukh; this is spirituality, and this is miraculous power. 
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  I am a minstrel of God, my Lord and Master;
        every day, I sing the songs of the Lord's Glorious Praises.
        I sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and I listen to
        the Praises of the Lord, the Master of wealth and Maya. The Lord
        is the Great Giver; all the world is begging; all beings and creatures
        are beggars. O Lord, You are kind and compassionate; You give
        Your gifts to even worms and insects among the rocks. Servant
        Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as Gurmukh,
        he has become truly wealthy.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:
        Reading and studying are just worldly pursuits, if there is thirst
        and corruption within. Reading in egotism, all have grown weary;
        through the love of duality, they are ruined. He alone is educated,
        and he alone is a wise Pandit, who contemplates the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad. He searches within himself, and finds the
        true essence; he finds the Door of Salvation. He finds the Lord,
        the treasure of excellence, and peacefully contemplates Him. Blessed
        is the trader, O Nanak, who, as Gurmukh, takes the Name as his
        only Support.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Without conquering his mind,
        no one can be successful. See this, and concentrate on it. The
        wandering holy men are tired of of making pilgrimages to sacred
        shrines; they have not been able to conquer their minds. The Gurmukh
        has conquered his mind, and he remains lovingly absorbed in the
        True Lord. O Nanak, this is how the filth of the mind is removed;
        the Word of the Shabad burns away the ego.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        O Saints of the Lord, O my Siblings of Destiny, please meet with
        me, and implant the Name of the One Lord within me. O humble servants
        of the Lord, adorn me with the decorations of the Lord, Har, Har;
        let me wear the robes of the Lord's forgiveness. Such decorations
        are pleasing to my God; such love is dear to the Lord. I chant
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, day and night; in an instant,
        all sins are eradicated. </p>

      </p>
      <p> That Gurmukh, unto whom the Lord becomes merciful, chants the
        Lord's Name, and wins the game of life.  || 21 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  The filth of countless incarnations sticks to this
        mind; it has become pitch black. The oily rag cannot be cleaned
        by merely washing it, even if it is washed a hundred times. By
        Guru's Grace, one remains dead while yet alive; his intellect
        is transformed, and he becomes detached from the world. O Nanak,
        no filth sticks to him, and he does not fall into the womb again.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Kali Yuga is called the Dark Age, but
        the most sublime state is attained in this age. The Gurmukh obtains
        the fruit, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises; this is his
        destiny, ordained by the Lord. O Nanak, by Guru's Grace,
        he worships the Lord night and day; he chants the Lord's
        Name, and remains absorbed in the Lord's devotional worship.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O Lord, unite me with the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, so that with my mouth, I may speak the sublime
        Word of the Guru's Bani. I sing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord, and constantly chant the Lord's Name; through the Guru's
        Teachings, I enjoy the Lord's Love constantly. I take the
        medicine of meditation on the Lord's Name, which has cured
        all diseases and multitudes of sufferings. Those who do not forget
        the Lord, while breathing or eating  -  know them to be the
        perfect servants of the Lord. Those Gurmukhs who worship the Lord
        in adoration end their subservience to the Messenger of Death,
        and to the world.  || 22 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O man, you
        have been tormented by a nightmare, and you have passed your life
        in sleep. You did not wake to hear the Word of the True Guru's
        Shabad; you have no inspiration within yourself. That body burns,
        which has no virtue, and which does not serve the Guru. I have
        seen that the world is burning, in egotism and the love of duality.
        O Nanak, those who seek the Guru's Sanctuary are saved; within
        their minds, they meditate on the True Word of the Shabad.  ||
        1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, the soul-bride
        is rid of egotism, and she is glorified. If she walks steadily
        in the way of His Will, then she is adorned with decorations.
        Her couch becomes beautiful, and she constantly enjoys her Husband
        Lord; she obtains the Lord as her Husband. The Lord does not die,
        and she never suffers pain; she is a happy soul-bride forever.
        O Nanak, the Lord God unites her with Himself; she enshrines love
        and affection for the Guru.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who conceal
        and deny their Guru, are the most evil people. O Dear Lord, let
        me not even see them; they are the worst sinners and murderers.
        They wander from house to house, with impure minds, like wicked,
        forsaken women. But by great good fortune, they may meet the Company
        of the Holy; as Gurmukhs, they are reformed. O Lord, please be
        kind and let me meet the True Guru; I am a sacrifice to the Guru.
        || 23 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Serving the Guru, peace is produced,
        and then, one does not suffer in pain. The cycle of birth and
        death is brought to an end, and death has no power over at all.
        His mind is imbued with the Lord, and he remains merged in the
        True Lord. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who walk in the
        Way of the True Guru's Will.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Without
        the Word of the Shabad, purity is not obtained, even though the
        soul-bride may adorn herself with all sorts of decorations. </p>
      <p>
        <center>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> She does not know the value of her Husband Lord; she is attached
        to the love of duality. She is impure, and ill-mannered, O Nanak;
        among women, she is the most evil woman.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Be
        kind to me, Lord, that I might chant the Word of Your Bani. May
        I meditate on the Lord's Name, chant the Lord's Name,
        and obtain the profit of the Lord's Name. I am a sacrifice
        to those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, day and night.
        May I behold with my eyes those who worship and adore my Beloved
        True Guru. I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has united me with
        my Lord, my friend, my very best friend.  || 24 ||   SHALOK, 
        FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord loves His slaves; the Lord is the friend
        of His slaves. The Lord is under the control of His slaves, like
        the musical instrument under the control of the musician. The
        Lord's slaves meditate on the Lord; they love their Beloved.
        Please, hear me, O God  -  let Your Grace rain over the whole
        world. The praise of the Lord's slaves is the Glory of the
        Lord. The Lord loves His Own Glory, and so His humble servant
        is celebrated and hailed. That humble servant of the Lord meditates
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Lord, and the Lord's
        humble servant, are one and the same. Servant Nanak is the slave
        of the Lord; O Lord, O God, please, preserve his honor.  || 1
        ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Nanak loves the True Lord; without Him, he
        cannot even survive. Meeting the True Guru, one finds the Perfect
        Lord, and the tongue enjoys the sublime essence of the Lord. 
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Night and day, morning and night, I sing to
        You, Lord. All beings and creatures meditate on Your Name. You
        are the Giver, the Great Giver; we eat whatever You give us. In
        the congregation of the devotees, sins are eradicated. Servant
        Nanak is forever a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, O Lord.
        || 25 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  He has spiritual ignorance
        within, and his intellect is dull and dim; he does not place his
        faith in the True Guru. He has deceit within himself, and so he
        sees deception in all others; through his deceptions, he is totally
        ruined. The True Guru's Will does not enter into his consciousness,
        and so he wanders around, pursuing his own interests. If He grants
        His Grace, then Nanak is absorbed into the Word of the Shabad.
        || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed
        in emotional attachment to Maya; in the love of duality, their
        minds are unsteady. Night and day, they are burning; day and night,
        they are totally ruined by their egotism. Within them, is the
        total pitch darkness of greed, and no one even approaches them.
        They themselves are miserable, and they never find peace; they
        are born, only to die, and die again. O Nanak, the True Lord God
        forgives those, who focus their consciousness on the Guru's
        feet. || 2 ||   PAUREE:  That Saint, that devotee, is acceptable,
        who is loved by God. Those beings are wise, who meditate on the
        Lord. They eat the food, the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam, the
        Name of the Lord. They apply the dust of the feet of the Saints
        to their foreheads. </p>

      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, they are purified, bathing in the sacred shrine of the
        Lord.  || 26 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  Within the Gurmukh is
        peace and tranquility; his mind and body are absorbed in the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. He contemplates the Naam, he studies the
        Naam, and he remains lovingly absorbed in the Naam. He obtains
        the treasure of the Naam, and his anxiety is dispelled. Meeting
        with the Guru, the Naam wells up, and his thirst and hunger are
        completely relieved. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, he gathers
        in the Naam.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  One who is cursed by the
        True Guru, abandons his home, and wanders around aimlessly. He
        is jeered at, and his face is blackened in the world hereafter.
        He babbles incoherently, and foaming at the mouth, he dies. What
        can anyone do? Such is his destiny, according to his past deeds.
        Wherever he goes, he is a liar, and by telling lies, he not liked
        by anyone. O Siblings of Destiny, behold this, the glorious greatness
        of our Lord and Master, O Saints; as one behaves, so does he receive.
        This shall be God's determination in His True Court; servant
        Nanak predicts and proclaims this.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The True
        Guru has established the village; the Guru has appointed its guards
        and protectors. My hopes are fulfilled, and my mind is imbued
        with the love of the Guru's Feet. The Guru is infinitely
        merciful; He has erased all my sins. The Guru has showered me
        with His Mercy, and He has made me His own. Nanak is forever a
        sacrifice to the Guru, who has countless virtues.  || 27 ||  
        SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  By His Command, we receive our pre-ordained
        rewards; so what can we do now, O Pandit? When His Command is
        received, then it is decided; all beings move and act accordingly.
        || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  The string through the nose is in the
        hands of the Lord Master; one's own actions drive him on.
        Wherever his food is, there he eats it; O Nanak, this is the Truth.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord Himself puts everything in its proper
        place. He Himself created the creation, and He Himself destroys
        it. He Himself fashions His creatures, and He Himself nourishes
        them. He hugs His slaves close in His embrace, and blesses them
        with His Glance of Grace. O Nanak, His devotees are forever in
        bliss; they have burnt away the love of duality.  || 28 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  O mind, meditate on the Dear Lord, with single-minded
        conscious concentration. The glorious greatness of the Lord shall
        last forever and ever; He never regrets what He gives. I am forever
        a sacrifice to the Lord; serving Him, peace is obtained. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukh remains merged with the Lord; he burns away his ego
        through the Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  He Himself
        enjoins us to serve Him, and He Himself blesses us with forgiveness.
        He Himself is the father and mother of all; He Himself cares for
        us. O Nanak, those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        abide in the home of their inner being; they are honored throughout
        the ages.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You are the Creator, all-powerful,
        able to do anything. </p>

      <p> Without You, there is no other at all. You Yourself created the
        world, and You Yourself shall destroy it in the end. The Word
        of Your Shabad alone is pervading everywhere; whatever You do,
        comes to pass. God blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness,
        and then, he finds the Lord. As Gurmukh, Nanak worships and adores
        the Lord; let everyone proclaim, &quot;Blessed, blessed, blessed
        is He, the Guru!&quot;  || 29 || 1 ||  SUDH  || </p>

        RAAG SORAT'H,  THE WORD OF DEVOTEE KABEER JEE,  FIRST HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Worshipping their idols, the Hindus die; the Muslims die bowing
        their heads. The Hindus cremate their dead, while the Muslims
        bury theirs; neither finds Your true state, Lord.  || 1 ||   O
        mind, the world is a deep, dark pit. On all four sides, Death
        has spread his net.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Reciting their poems,
        the poets die; the mystical ascetics die while journeying to Kaydaar
        Naat'h. The Yogis die, with their matted hair, but even they
        do not find Your state, Lord.  || 2 ||   The kings die, gathering
        and hoarding their money, burying great quantities of gold. The
        Pandits die, reading and reciting the Vedas; women die, gazing
        at their own beauty.  || 3 ||   Without the Lord's Name,
        all come to ruin; behold, and know this, O body. Without the Name
        of the Lord, who can find salvation? Kabeer speaks the Teachings.
        || 4 || 1 ||   When the body is burnt, it turns to ashes; if
        it is not cremated, then it is eaten by armies of worms. The unbaked
        clay pitcher dissolves, when water is poured into it; this is
        also the nature of the body.  || 1 ||   Why, O Siblings of Destiny,
        do you strut around, all puffed up with pride? Have you forgotten
        those days, when you were hanging, face down, for ten months?
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Like the bee which collects honey, the fool
        eagerly gathers and collects wealth. At the time of death, they
        shout, &quot;Take him away, take him away! Why leave a ghost lying
        around?&quot;  || 2 ||   His wife accompanies his to the threshold,
        and his friends and companions beyond. All the people and relatives
        go as far as the cremation grounds, and then, the soul-swan goes
        on alone.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, listen, O mortal being: you
        have been seized by Death, and you have fallen into the deep,
        dark pit. You have entangled yourself in the false wealth of Maya,
        like the parrot caught in the trap.  || 4 || 2 ||   Listening
        to all the teachings of the Vedas and the Puraanas, I wanted to
        perform the religious rituals. But seeing all the wise men caught
        by Death, I arose and left the Pandits; now I am free of this
        desire.  || 1 ||   O mind, you have not completed the only task
        you were given; you have not meditated on the Lord, your King.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Going to the forests, they practice Yoga
        and deep, austere meditation; they live on roots and the fruits
        they gather. The musicians, the Vedic scholars, the chanters of
        one word and the men of silence, all are listed on the Register
        of Death.  || 2 ||   Loving devotional worship does not enter
        into your heart; pampering and adorning your body, you must still
        give it up. You sit and play music, but you are still a hypocrite;
        what do you expect to receive from the Lord?  || 3 || </p>

      <p> Death has fallen on the whole world; the doubting religious scholars
        are also listed on the Register of Death. Says Kabeer, those humble
        people become pure  -  they become Khalsa  -  who know the
        Lord's loving devotional worship.  || 4 || 3 ||  SECOND HOUSE
        ||   With both of my eyes, I look around; I don't see anything
        except the Lord. My eyes gaze lovingly upon Him, and now, I cannot
        speak of anything else.  || 1 ||   My doubts were removed, and
        my fear ran away, when my consciousness became attached to the
        Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When the magician beats
        his tambourine, everyone comes to see the show. When the magician
        winds up his show, then he enjoys its play all alone.  || 2 ||
        By preaching sermons, one's doubt is not dispelled. Everyone
        is tired of preaching and teaching. The Lord causes the Gurmukh
        to understand; his heart remains permeated with the Lord.  ||
        3 ||   When the Guru grants even a bit of His Grace, one's
        body, mind and entire being are absorbed into the Lord. Says Kabeer,
        I am imbued with the Lord's Love; I have met with the Life
        of the world, the Great Giver.  || 4 || 4 ||   Let the sacred
        scriptures be your milk and cream, and the ocean of the mind the
        churning vat. Be the butter-churner of the Lord, and your buttermilk
        shall not be wasted.  || 1 ||   O soul-bride slave, why don't
        you take the Lord as your Husband? He is the Life of the world,
        the Support of the breath of life.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The chain
        is around your neck, and the cuffs are on your feet. The Lord
        has sent you wandering around from house to house. And still,
        you do not meditate on the Lord, O soul-bride, slave. Death is
        watching you, O wretched woman.  || 2 ||   The Lord God is the
        Cause of causes. What is in the hands of the poor soul-bride,
        the slave? She awakens from her slumber, and she becomes attached
        to whatever the Lord attaches her.  || 3 ||   O soul-bride, slave,
        where did you obtain that wisdom, by which you erased your inscription
        of doubt? Kabeer has tasted that subtle essence; by Guru's
        Grace, his mind is reconciled with the Lord.  || 4 || 5 ||   Without
        Him, we cannot even live; when we meet Him, then our task is completed.
        People say it is good to live forever, but without dying, there
        is no life.  || 1 ||   So now, what sort wisdom should I contemplate
        and preach? As I watch, worldly things dissipate.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Saffron is ground up, and mixed with sandalwood; without
        eyes, the world is seen. The son has given birth to his father;
        without a place, the city has been established.  || 2 ||   The
        humble beggar has found the Great Giver, but he is unable to eat
        what he has been given. He cannot leave it alone, but it is never
        exhausted. He shall not go to beg from others any longer.  ||
        3 ||   Those select few, who know how to die while yet alive,
        enjoy great peace. Kabeer has found that wealth; meeting with
        the Lord, he has erased his self-conceit.  || 4 || 6 ||   What
        use is it to read, and what use is it to study? What use is it
        to listen to the Vedas and the Puraanas? What use is reading and
        listening, if celestial peace is not attained?  || 1 ||   The
        fool does not chant the Name of the Lord. So what does he think
        of, over and over again?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the darkness,
        we need a lamp to find the incomprehensible thing. </p>

      <p> I have found this incomprehensible thing; my mind is illuminated
        and enlightened.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, now I know Him; since
        I know Him, my mind is pleased and appeased. My mind is pleased
        and appeased, and yet, people do not believe it. They do not believe
        it, so what can I do?  || 3 || 7 ||   In his heart there is deception,
        and yet in his mouth are words of wisdom. You are false  - 
        why are you churning water?  || 1 ||   Why do you bother to wash
        your body? Your heart is still full of filth.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The gourd may be washed at the sixty-eight sacred shrines,
        but even then, its bitterness is not removed.  || 2 ||   Says
        Kabeer after deep contemplation, please help me cross over the
        terrifying world-ocean, O Lord, O Destroyer of ego.  || 3 || 8

      <p> Practicing great hypocrisy, he acquires the wealth of others.
        Returning home, he squanders it on his wife and children.  ||
        1 ||   O my mind, do not practice deception, even inadvertently.
        In the end, your own soul shall have to answer for its account.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Moment by moment, the body is wearing away,
        and old age is asserting itself. And then, when you are old, no
        one shall pour water into your cup.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, no
        one belongs to you. Why not chant the Lord's Name in your
        heart, when you are still young?  || 3 || 9 ||   O Saints, my
        windy mind has now become peaceful and still. It seems that I
        have learned something of the science of Yoga.  ||  Pause  ||
        The Guru has shown me the hole, through which the deer carefully
        enters. I have now closed off the doors, and the unstruck celestial
        sound current resounds.  || 1 ||   The pitcher of my heart-lotus
        is filled with water; I have spilled out the water, and set it
        upright. Says Kabeer, the Lord's humble servant, this I know.
        Now that I know this, my mind is pleased and appeased.  || 2 ||
        10 ||   RAAG SORAT'H:  I am so hungry, I cannot perform devotional
        worship service. Here, Lord, take back Your mala. I beg for the
        dust of the feet of the Saints. I do not owe anyone anything.
        || 1 ||   O Lord, how can I be with You? If You do not give me
        Yourself, then I shall beg until I get You.  ||  Pause  ||   I
        ask for two kilos of flour, and half a pound of ghee, and salt.
        I ask for a pound of beans, which I shall eat twice a day.  ||
        2 ||   I ask for a cot, with four legs, and a pillow and mattress.
        I ask for a quit to cover myself. Your humble servant shall perform
        Your devotional worship service with love.  || 3 ||   I have no
        greed; Your Name is the only ornament I wish for. Says Kabeer,
        my mind is pleased and appeased; now that my mind is pleased and
        appeased, I have come to know the Lord.  || 4 || 11 || </p>

      <p> Then I, his humble servant, become patient.  || 1 ||   Meeting
        the Divine True Guru, I merge into the sound current of the Naad.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Where the dazzling white light is seen,
        there the unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds. One's
        light merges in the Light; by Guru's Grace, I know this.
        || 2 ||   The jewels are in the treasure chamber of the heart-lotus.
        They sparkle and glitter like lightning. The Lord is near at hand,
        not far away. He is totally permeating and pervading in my soul.
        || 3 ||   Where the light of the undying sun shines, the light
        of burning lamps seems insignificant. By Guru's Grace, I
        know this. Servant Naam Dayv is absorbed in the Celestial Lord.
        || 4 || 1 ||   FOURTH HOUSE,  SORAT'H:  The woman next door
        asked Naam Dayv, &quot;Who built your house? I shall pay him double
        wages. Tell me, who is your carpenter?&quot;  || 1 ||   O sister,
        I cannot give this carpenter to you. Behold, my carpenter is pervading
        everywhere. My carpenter is the Support of the breath of life.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This carpenter demands the wages of love,
        if someone wants Him to build their house. When one breaks his
        ties with all the people and relatives, then the carpenter comes
        of His own accord.  || 2 ||   I cannot describe such a carpenter,
        who is contained in everything, everywhere. The mute tastes the
        most sublime ambrosial nectar, but if you ask him to describe
        it, he cannot.  || 3 ||   Listen to the virtues of this carpenter,
        O sister; He stopped the oceans, and established Dhroo as the
        pole star. Naam Dayv's Lord Master brought Sita back, and
        gave Sri Lanka to Bhabheekhan.  || 4 || 2 ||   SORAT'H, 
        THIRD HOUSE:  The skinless drum plays. Without the rainy season,
        the clouds shake with thunder. Without clouds, the rain falls,
        if one contemplates the essence of reality.  || 1 ||   I have
        met my Beloved Lord. Meeting with Him, my body is made beauteous
        and sublime.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Touching the philosopher's
        stone, I have been transformed into gold. I have threaded the
        jewels into my mouth and mind. I love Him as my own, and my doubt
        has been dispelled. Seeking the Guru's guidance, my mind
        is content.  || 2 ||   The water is contained within the pitcher;
        I know that the One Lord is contained in all. The mind of the
        disciple has faith in the Guru. Servant Naam Dayv understands
        the essence of reality.  || 3 || 3 || </p>

      <p> When I am in my ego, then You are not with me. Now that You are
        with me, there is no egotism within me. The wind may raise up
        huge waves in the vast ocean, but they are just water in water.
        || 1 ||   O Lord, what can I say about such an illusion? Things
        are not as they seem.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   It is like the king,
        who falls asleep upon his throne, and dreams that he is a beggar. </p>

      <p> His kingdom is intact, but separated from it, he suffers in sorrow.
        Such is my own condition.  || 2 ||   Like the story of the rope
        mistaken for a snake, the mystery has now been explained to me.
        Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were gold;
        now, I do not say what I said then.  || 3 ||   The One Lord is
        pervading the many forms; He enjoys Himself in all hearts. Says
        Ravi Daas, the Lord is nearer than our own hands and feet. Whatever
        will be, will be.  || 4 || 1 ||   If I am bound by the noose of
        emotional attachment, then I shall bind You, Lord, with the bonds
        of love. Go ahead and try to escape, Lord; I have escaped by worshipping
        and adoring You.  || 1 ||   O Lord, You know my love for You.
        Now, what will You do?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   A fish is caught,
        cut up, and cooked it in many different ways. Bit by bit, it is
        eaten, but still, it does not forget the water.  || 2 ||   The
        Lord, our King, is father to no one, except those who love Him.
        The veil of emotional attachment has been cast over the entire
        world, but it does not bother the Lord's devotee.  || 3 ||
        Says Ravi Daas, my devotion to the One Lord is increasing; now,
        who can I tell this to? That which brought me to worship and adore
        You  -  I am still suffering that pain.  || 4 || 2 ||   I obtained
        this precious human life as a reward for my past actions, but
        without discriminating wisdom, it is wasted in vain. Tell me,
        without devotional worship of the Lord, of what use are mansions
        and thrones like those of King Indra?  || 1 ||   You have not
        considered the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, our King;
        this sublime essence shall cause you to forget all other essences.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   We do not know what we need to know, and
        we have become insane. We do not consider what we should consider;
        our days are passing away. Our passions are strong, and our discriminating
        intellect is weak; we have no access to the supreme objective.
        || 2 ||   We say one thing, and do something else; entangled
        in endless Maya, we do not understand anything. Says Ravi Daas,
        Your slave, O Lord, I am disillusioned and detached; please, spare
        me Your anger, and have mercy on my soul.  || 3 || 3 ||   He is
        the ocean of peace; the miraculous tree of life, the wish-fulfilling
        jewel, and the Kaamadhayna, the cow which fulfills all desires,
        all are in His power. The four great blessings, the eighteen supernatural
        spiritual powers of the Siddhas, and the nine treasures, are all
        in the palm of His hand.  || 1 ||   You do not chant with your
        tongue the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. Abandon your involvement
        in all other words.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The various Shaastras,
        Puranaas, and the Vedas of Brahma, are made up of thirty-four
        letters. After deep contemplation, Vyaas spoke of the supreme
        objective; there is nothing equal to the Lord's Name.  ||
        2 ||   Very fortunate are those who are absorbed in celestial
        bliss, and released from their entanglements; they are lovingly
        attached to the Lord. Says Ravi Daas, enshrine the Lord's
        Light within your heart, and your fear of birth and death shall
        run away from you.  || 3 || 4 ||   If You are the mountain, Lord,
        then I am the peacock. If You are the moon, then I am the partridge
        in love with it.  || 1 ||   O Lord, if You will not break with
        me, then I will not break with You. For, if I were to break with
        You, with whom would I then join?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If You
        are the lamp, then I am the wick. </p>

      <p> If You are the sacred place of pilgrimage, then I am the pilgrim.
        || 2 ||   I am joined in true love with You, Lord. I am joined
        with You, and I have broken with all others.  || 3 ||   Wherever
        I go, there I serve You. There is no other Lord Master than You,
        O Divine Lord.  || 4 ||   Meditating, vibrating upon You, the
        noose of death is cut away. To attain devotional worship, Ravi
        Daas sings to You, Lord.  || 5 || 5 ||   The body is a wall of
        water, supported by the pillars of air; the egg and sperm are
        the mortar. The framework is made up of bones, flesh and veins;
        the poor soul-bird dwells within it.  || 1 ||   O mortal, what
        is mine, and what is yours? The soul is like a bird perched upon
        a tree.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You lay the foundation and build
        the walls. But in the end, three and a half cubits will be your
        measured space.  || 2 ||   You make your hair beautiful, and wear
        a stylish turban on your head. But in the end, this body shall
        be reduced to a pile of ashes.  || 3 ||   Your palaces are lofty,
        and your brides are beautiful. But without the Lord's Name,
        you shall lose the game entirely.  || 4 ||   My social status
        is low, my ancestry is low, and my life is wretched. I have come
        to Your Sanctuary, O Luminous Lord, my King; so says Ravi Daas,
        the shoemaker.  || 5 || 6 ||   I am a shoemaker, but I do not
        know how to mend shoes. People come to me to mend their shoes.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have no awl to stitch them; I have no
        knife to patch them.   || 1 ||   Mending, mending, people waste
        their lives and ruin themselves. Without wasting my time mending,
        I have found the Lord.  || 2 ||   Ravi Daas chants the Lord's
        Name; he is not concerned with the Messenger of Death.  || 3 ||

      <p> Tears well up in my eyes, my body has become weak, and my hair
        has become milky-white. My throat is tight, and I cannot utter
        even one word; what can I do now? I am a mere mortal.  || 1 ||
        O Lord, my King, Gardener of the world-garden, be my Physician,
        and save me, Your Saint.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My head aches,
        my body is burning, and my heart is filled with anguish. Such
        is the disease that has struck me; there is no medicine to cure
        it.  || 2 ||   The Name of the Lord, the ambrosial, immaculate
        water, is the best medicine in the world. By Guru's Grace,
        says servant Bheekhan, I have found the Door of Salvation.  ||
        3 || 1 ||   Such is the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the invaluable
        jewel, the most sublime wealth, which I have found through good
        deeds. By various efforts, I have enshrined it within my heart;
        this jewel cannot be hidden by hiding it.  || 1 ||   The Glorious
        Praises of the Lord cannot be spoken by speaking. They are like
        the sweet candies given to a mute.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The tongue
        speaks, the ears listen, and the mind contemplates the Lord; they
        find peace and comfort. Says Bheekhan, my eyes are content; wherever
