      <p> O Nanak, with the Name of the Lord abiding in one's mind,
        no obstacles stand in one's way, O Siblings of Destiny. 
        || 8 || 2 ||   SORAT'H,  THIRD MEHL:  The Dear Lord is realized
        through the Word of His Shabad, O Siblings of Destiny, which is
        found only by perfect destiny. The happy soul-brides are forever
        in peace, O Siblings of Destiny; night and day, they are attuned
        to the Lord's Love.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, You Yourself
        color us in Your Love. Sing, continually sing His Praises, imbued
        with His Love, O Siblings of Destiny; be in love with the Lord.
        ||  Pause  ||   Work to serve the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny;
        abandon self-conceit, and and focus your consciousness. You shall
        be in peace forever, and you shall not suffer in pain any longer,
        O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord Himself shall come and abide in
        your mind.  || 2 ||   She who does not know the Will of her Husband
        Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, is an ill-mannered and bitter bride.
        She does things with a stubborn mind, O Siblings of Destiny; without
        the Name, she is false.  || 3 ||   They alone sing the Lord's
        Praises, who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their
        foreheads, O Siblings of Destiny; through the Love of the True
        Lord, they find detachment. Night and day, they are imbued with
        His Love; they utter His Glorious Praises, O Siblings of Destiny,
        and they lovingly focus their consciousness on the Fearless Guru.
        || 4 ||   He kills and revives all, O Siblings of Destiny; serve
        Him, day and night. How can we forget Him from our minds, O Siblings
        of Destiny? His gifts are glorious and great.  || 5 ||   The self-willed
        manmukh is filthy and double-minded, O Siblings of Destiny; the
        finds no place of rest in the Court of the Lord. But if she becomes
        Gurmukh, then she chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O Siblings
        of Destiny; the meets her True Beloved, and merges in Him.  ||
        6 ||   In this life, she has not focused her consciousness on
        the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; how can she show her face when
        she leaves? In spite of the warning calls which were sounded,
        she has been plundered, O Siblings of Destiny; she yearned only
        for corruption.  || 7 ||   Those who dwell upon the Naam, O Siblings
        of Destiny, their bodies are ever peaceful and tranquil. O Nanak,
        dwell upon the Naam; the Lord is infinite, virtuous and unfathomable,
        O Siblings of Destiny.  || 8 || 3 || </p>

        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  ASHTAPADEES:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The One who created the whole world, O Siblings of Destiny, is
        the Almighty Lord, the Cause of causes. He fashioned the soul
        and the body, O Siblings of Destiny, by His own power. How can
        He be described? How can He be seen, O Siblings of Destiny? The
        Creator is One; He is indescribable. Praise the Guru, the Lord
        of the Universe, O Siblings of Destiny; through Him, the essence
        is known.  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate on the Lord, the Lord
        God. He blesses His servant with the gift of the Naam; He is the
        Destroyer of pain and suffering.  ||  Pause  ||   Everything is
        in His home, O Siblings of Destiny; His warehouse is overflowing
        with the nine treasures. His worth cannot be estimated, O Siblings
        of Destiny; He is lofty, inaccessible and infinite. He cherishes
        all beings and creatures, O Siblings of Destiny; he continually
        takes care of them. So meet with the Perfect True Guru, O Siblings
        of Destiny, and merge in the Word of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   Adoring
        the feet of the True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, doubt and fear
        are dispelled. Joining the Society of the Saints, cleanse your
        mind, O Siblings of Destiny, and dwell in the Name of the Lord.
        The darkness of ignorance shall be dispelled, O Siblings of Destiny,
        and the lotus of your heart shall blossom forth. </p>

      </p>
      <p> By the Guru's Word, peace wells up, O Siblings of Destiny;
        all fruits are with the True Guru.  || 3 ||   Give up your sense
        of mine and yours, O Siblings of Destiny, and become the dust
        of the feet of all. In each and every heart, God is contained,
        O Siblings of Destiny; He sees, and hears, and is ever-present
        with us. On that day when one forgets the Supreme Lord God, O
        Siblings of Destiny, on that day, one ought to die crying out
        in pain. He is the all-powerful Cause of Causes, O Siblings of
        Destiny; he is totally filled with all powers.  || 4 ||   The
        Love of the Name is the greatest treasure, O Siblings of Destiny;
        through it, emotional attachment to Maya is dispelled. If it is
        pleasing to His Will, then He unites us in His Union, O Siblings
        of Destiny; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to abide in
        the mind. The heart-lotus of the Gurmukh blossoms forth, O Siblings
        of Destiny, and the heart is illumined. The Glory of God has been
        revealed, O Siblings of Destiny, and the earth and sky have blossomed
        forth.  || 5 ||   The Perfect Guru has blessed me with contentment,
        O Siblings of Destiny; day and night, I remain attached to the
        Lord's Love. My tongue continually chants the Lord's
        Name, O Siblings of Destiny; this is the true taste, and the object
        of human life. Listening with my ears, I hear and so I live, O
        Siblings of Destiny; I have obtained the unchanging, unmoving
        state. That soul,which does not place its faith in the Lord shall
        burn, O Siblings of Destiny.  || 6 ||   My Lord and Master has
        so many virtues, O Siblings of Destiny; I am a sacrifice to Him.
        He nurtures even the most worthless, O Siblings of Destiny, and
        gives home to the homeless. He gives us nourishment with each
        and every breath, O Siblings of Destiny; His Name is everlasting.
        One who meets with the True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, does
        so only by perfect destiny.  || 7 ||   Without Him, I cannot live,
        even for an instant, O Siblings of Destiny; He is totally filled
        with all powers. With every breath and morsel of food, I will
        not forget Him, O Siblings of Destiny; I behold Him ever-present.
        In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I meet Him, O Siblings
        of Destiny; He is totally pervading and permeating everywhere.
        Those who do not embrace love for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny,
        always die crying out in pain.  || 8 ||   Grasping hold of the
        hem of His robe, O Siblings of Destiny, we are carried across
        the world-ocean of fear and pain. By His Glance of Grace, He has
        blessed us, O Siblings of Destiny; He shall be with us until the
        very end. My mind and body are soothed and calmed, O Siblings
        of Destiny, nourished by the food of the Naam. Nanak has entered
        His Sanctuary, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is the Destroyer
        of sins.  || 9 || 1 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The womb
        of the mother is an ocean of pain, O Beloved; even there, the
        Lord causes His Name to be chanted. When he emerges, he finds
        corruption pervading everywhere, O Beloved, and he becomes increasingly
        attached to Maya. One whom the Lord blesses with His kind favor,
        O Beloved, meets the Perfect Guru. He worships the Lord in adoration
        with each and every breath, O Beloved; he is lovingly attached
        to the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   You are the support of my
        mind and body, O Beloved; You are the support of my mind and body.
        There is no other Creator except for You, O Beloved; You alone
        are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.  ||  Pause  || 
        After wandering in doubt for millions of incarnations, he comes
        into the world, O Beloved; for uncounted lifetimes, he has suffered
        in pain. He has forgotten his True Lord and Master, O Beloved,
        and so he suffers terrible punishment. Those who meet with the
        Perfect True Guru, O Beloved, are attached to the True Name. </p>

      <p> We are saved by following those, O Beloved, who seek the Sanctuary
        of the True Lord.  || 2 ||   He thinks that his food is so sweet,
        O Beloved, but it makes his body ill. It turns out to be bitter,
        O Beloved, and it produces only sadness. The Lord leads him astray
        in the enjoyment of pleasures, O Beloved, and so his sense of
        separation does not depart. Those who meet the Guru are saved,
        O Beloved; this is their pre-ordained destiny.  || 3 ||   He is
        filled with longing for Maya, O Beloved, and so the Lord does
        not ever come into his mind. Those who forget You, O Supreme Lord
        Master, their bodies turn to dust. They cry out and scream horribly,
        O Beloved, but their torment does not end. Those who meet the
        Guru, and reform themselves, O Beloved, their capital remains
        intact.  || 4 ||   As far as possible, do not associate with the
        faithless cynics, O Beloved. Meeting with them, the Lord is forgotten,
        O Beloved, and you rise and depart with a blackened face. The
        self-willed manmukh finds no rest or shelter, O Beloved; in the
        Court of the Lord, they are punished. Those who meet with the
        Guru, and reform themselves, O Beloved, their affairs are resolved.
        || 5 ||   One may have thousands of clever tricks and techniques
        of austere self-discipline, O Beloved, but not even one of them
        will go with him. Those who turn their backs on the Lord of the
        Universe, O Beloved, their families are stained with disgrace.
        He does not know that thing which is, O Beloved; falsehood will
        not help him. Those who meet with the True Guru, O Beloved, dwell
        upon the True Name.  || 6 ||   When the Lord casts His Glance
        of Grace, O Beloved, one is blessed with Truth, contentment, wisdom
        and meditation. Night and day, he sings the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises, O Beloved, totally filled with Ambrosial Nectar. He crosses
        over the sea of pain, O Beloved, and swims across the terrifying
        world-ocean. One who is pleasing to His Will, He unites with Himself,
        O Beloved; he is forever true.  || 7 ||   The all-powerful Divine
        Lord is compassionate, O Beloved; He is the Support of His devotees.
        I seek His Sanctuary, O Beloved; He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts. He has adorned me in this world and the next, O Beloved;
        He has placed the Emblem of Truth upon my forehead. I shall never
        forget that God, O Beloved; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him.

      <p> They read scriptures, and contemplate the Vedas; they practice
        the inner cleansing techniques of Yoga, and control of the breath.
        But they cannot escape from the company of the five passions;
        they are increasingly bound to egotism.  || 1 ||   O Beloved,
        this is not the way to meet the Lord; I have performed these rituals
        so many times. I have collapsed, exhausted, at the Door of my
        Lord Master; I pray that He may grant me a discerning intellect.

        bowls, and wander naked in the forest. </p>

      <p> He may make pilgrimages to river banks and sacred shrines all
        over the world, but his sense of duality will not leave him. 
        || 2 ||   His mind's desires may lead him to go and dwell
        at sacred places of pilgrimage, and offer his head to be sawn
        off; but this will not cause the filth of his mind to depart,
        even though he may make thousands of efforts.  || 3 ||   He may
        give gifts of all sorts  -  gold, women, horses and elephants.
        He may make offerings of corn, clothes and land in abundance,
        but this will not lead him to the Lord's Door.  || 4 || 
        He may remain devoted to worship and adoration, bowing his forehead
        to the floor, practicing the six religious rituals. He indulges
        in egotism and pride, and falls into entanglements, but he does
        not meet the Lord by these devices.  || 5 ||   He practices the
        eighty-four postures of Yoga, and acquires the supernatural powers
        of the Siddhas, but he gets tired of practicing these. He lives
        a long life, but is reincarnated again and again; he has not met
        with the Lord.  || 6 ||   He may enjoy princely pleasures, and
        regal pomp and ceremony, and issue unchallenged commands. He may
        lie on beautiful beds, perfumed with sandalwood oil, but this
        will led him only to the gates of the most horrible hell.  ||
        7 ||   Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is the highest of all actions.

        it.  || 8 ||   Your slave is intoxicated with this Love of Yours.
        The Destroyer of the pains of the poor has become merciful to
        me, and this mind is imbued with the Praises of the Lord, Har,

        VAAR OF RAAG SORAT'H,  FOURTH MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Sorat'h is always beautiful, if it
        brings the True Lord to dwell in the mind of the soul-bride. Her
        teeth are clean and her mind is not split by duality; the Name
        of the True Lord is on her tongue. Here and hereafter, she abides
        in the Fear of God, and serves the True Guru without hesitation.
        Discarding worldly adornments, she meets her Husband Lord, and
        she celebrates joyfully with Him. She is adorned forever with
        the Name in her mind, and she does not have even an iota of filth.
        Her husband's younger and elder brothers, the corrupt desires,
        have died, suffering in pain; and now, who fears Maya, the mother-in-law?
        If she becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord, O Nanak, she bears
        the jewel of good karma upon her forehead, and everything is Truth
        to her.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Sorat'h is beautiful only
        when it leads the soul-bride to seek the Lord's Name. She
        pleases her Guru and God; under Guru's Instruction, she speaks
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. She is attracted to the Lord's
        Name, day and night, and her body is drenched in the color of
        the Love of the Lord, Har, Har. No other being like the Lord God
        can be found; I have looked and searched over the whole world.
        The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam within me; my
        mind does not waver any more. Servant Nanak is the Lord's
        slave, the slave of the slaves of the Guru, the True Guru.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  You Yourself are the Creator, the Fashioner of
        the world. You Yourself have arranged the play, and You Yourself
        arrange it. You Yourself are the Giver and the Creator; You Yourself
        are the Enjoyer. The Word of Your Shabad is pervading everywhere,
        O Creator Lord. As Gurmukh, I ever praise the Lord; I am a sacrifice
        to the Guru.  || 1 || </p>

      </p>
      <p> SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  In the flames of egotism, he is burnt to
        death; he wanders in doubt and the love of duality. The Perfect
        True Guru saves him, making him His own. This world is burning;
        through the Sublime Word of the Guru's Shabad, this comes
        to be seen. Those who are attuned to the Shabad are cooled and
        soothed; O Nanak, they practice Truth.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        Service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding; blessed and
        acceptable is such a life. Those who do not forget the True Guru,
        in life and in death, are truly wise people. Their families are
        saved, and they are approved by the Lord. The Gurmukhs are approved
        in death as in life, while the self-willed manmukhs continue the
        cycle of birth and death. O Nanak, they are not described as dead,
        who are absorbed in the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  Serve the Immaculate Lord God, and meditate on the
        Lord's Name. Join the Society of the Holy Saints, and be
        absorbed in the Lord's Name. O Lord, glorious and great is
        service to You; I am so foolish  -  please, commit me to it.
        I am Your servant and slave; command me, according to Your Will.
        As Gurmukh, I shall serve You, as Guru has instructed me.  ||
        2 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  He acts according to pre-ordained
        destiny, written by the Creator Himself. Emotional attachment
        has drugged him, and he has forgotten the Lord, the treasure of
        virtue. Don't think that he is alive in the world  - 
        he is dead, through the love of duality. Those who do not meditate
        on the Lord, as Gurmukh, are not permitted to sit near the Lord.
        They suffer the most horrible pain and suffering, and neither
        their sons nor their wives go along with them. Their faces are
        blackened among men, and they sigh in deep regret. No one places
        any reliance in the self-willed manmukhs; trust in them is lost.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukhs live in absolute peace; the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, abides within them.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  They
        alone are relatives, and they alone are friends, who, as Gurmukh,
        join together in love. Night and day, they act according to the
        True Guru's Will; they remain absorbed in the True Name.
        Those who are attached to the love of duality are not called friends;
        they practice egotism and corruption. The self-willed manmukhs
        are selfish; they cannot resolve anyone's affairs. O Nanak,
        they act according to their pre-ordained destiny; no one can erase
        it.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You Yourself created the world, and You
        Yourself arranged the play of it. You Yourself created the three
        qualities, and fostered emotional attachment to Maya. He is called
        to account for his deeds done in egotism; he continues coming
        and going in reincarnation. The Guru instructs those whom the
        Lord Himself blesses with Grace. I am a sacrifice to my Guru;
        forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  The love of Maya is enticing; without teeth, it
        has eaten up the world. The self-willed manmukhs are eaten away,
        while the Gurmukhs are saved; they focus their consciousness on
        the True Name. Without the Name, the world wanders around insane;
        the Gurmukhs come to see this. </p>

        Lord does not come to abide in his mind. O Nanak, they alone obtain
        the Name, who have such pre-ordained destiny.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  The home within is filled with Ambrosial Nectar, but the
        self-willed manmukh does not get to taste it. He is like the deer,
        who does not recognize its own musk-scent; it wanders around,
        deluded by doubt. The manmukh forsakes the Ambrosial Nectar, and
        instead gathers poison; the Creator Himself has fooled him. How
        rare are the Gurmukhs, who obtain this understanding; they behold
        the Lord God within themselves. Their minds and bodies are cooled
        and soothed, and their tongues enjoy the sublime taste of the
        Lord. Through the Word of the Shabad, the Name wells up; through
        the Shabad, we are united in the Lord's Union. Without the
        Shabad, the whole world is insane, and it loses its life in vain.
        The Shabad alone is Ambrosial Nectar; O Nanak, the Gurmukhs obtain
        it.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord God is inaccessible; tell me,
        how can we find Him? He has no form or feature, and He cannot
        be seen; tell me, how can we meditate on Him? The Lord is formless,
        immaculate and inaccessible; which of His Virtues should we speak
        of and sing? They alone walk on the Lord's Path, whom the
        Lord Himself instructs. The Perfect Guru has revealed Him to me;
        serving the Guru, He is found.  || 4 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:
        It is as if my body has been crushed in the oil-press, without
        yielding even a drop of blood; it is as if my soul has been cut
        apart into pieces for the sake of the Love of the True Lord; O
        Nanak, still, night and day, my Union with the Lord is not broken.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  My Friend is so full of joy and love;
        He colors my mind with the color of His Love, like the fabric
        which is treated to retain the color of the dye. O Nanak, this
        color does not depart, and no other color can be imparted to this
        fabric.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord Himself is pervading everywhere;
        the Lord Himself causes us to chant His Name. The Lord Himself
        created the creation; He commits all to their tasks. He engages
        some in devotional worship, and others, He causes to stray. He
        places some on the Path, while He leads others into the wilderness.
        Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as
        Gurmukh, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 5 || 
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Service to the True Guru is fruitful and
        rewarding, if one performs it with his mind focused on it. The
        fruits of the mind's desires are obtained, and egotism departs
        from within. His bonds are broken, and he is liberated; he remains
        absorbed in the True Lord. It is so difficult to obtain the Naam
        in this world; it comes to dwell in the mind of the Gurmukh. O
        Nanak, I am a sacrifice to one who serves his True Guru.  || 1
        ||   THIRD MEHL:  The mind of the self-willed manmukh is so very
        stubborn; it is stuck in the love of duality. He does not find
        peace, even in dreams; he passes his life in misery and suffering.
        The Pandits have grown weary of going door to door, reading and
        reciting their scriptures; the Siddhas have gone into their trances
        of Samaadhi. This mind cannot be controlled; they are tired of
        performing religious rituals. The impersonators have grown weary
        of wearing false costumes, and bathing at the sixty-eight sacred
        shrines. </p>

      <p> They do not know the state of their own minds; they are deluded
        by doubt and egotism. By Guru's Grace, the Fear of God is
        obtained; by great good fortune, the Lord comes to abide in the
        mind. When the Fear of God comes, the mind is restrained, and
        through the Word of the Shabad, the ego is burnt away. Those who
        are imbued with Truth are immaculate; their light merges in the
        Light. Meeting the True Guru, one obtains the Name; O Nanak, he
        is absorbed in peace.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The pleasures of kings
        and emperors are pleasing, but they last for only a few days.
        These pleasures of Maya are like the color of the safflower, which
        wears off in a moment. They do not go with him when he departs;
        instead, he carries the load of sins upon his head. When death
        seizes him, and marches him away, then he looks absolutely hideous.
        That lost opportunity will not come into his hands again, and
        in the end, he regrets and repents.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Those who turn their faces away from the True Guru, suffer
        in sorrow and bondage. Again and again, they are born only to
        die; they cannot meet their Lord. The disease of doubt does not
        depart, and they find only pain and more pain. O Nanak, if the
        Gracious Lord forgives, then one is united in Union with the Word
        of the Shabad.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Those who turn their faces
        away from the True Guru, shall find no place of rest or shelter.
        They wander around from door to door, like a woman forsaken, with
        a bad character and a bad reputation. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are
        forgiven, and united in Union with the True Guru.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Those who serve the True Lord, the Destroyer of ego, cross over
        the terrifying world-ocean. Those who chant the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, are passed over by the Messenger of Death. Those who
        meditate on the Lord, go to His Court in robes of honor. They
        alone serve You, O Lord, whom You bless with Grace. I sing continually
        Your Glorious Praises, O Beloved; as Gurmukh, my doubts and fears
        have been dispelled.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Upon the
        plate, three things have been placed; this is the sublime, ambrosial
        food of the Lord. Eating this, the mind is satisfied, and the
        Door of Salvation is found. It is so difficult to obtain this
        food, O Saints; it is obtained only by contemplating the Guru.
        Why should we cast this riddle out of our minds? We should keep
        it ever enshrined in our hearts. The True Guru has posed this
        riddle. The Guru's Sikhs have found its solution. O Nanak,
        he alone understands this, whom the Lord inspires to understand.
        The Gurmukhs work hard, and find the Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        Those whom the Primal Lord unites, remain in Union with Him;
        they focus their consciousness on the True Guru. Those whom the
        Lord Himself separates, remain separated; in the love of duality,
        they are ruined. O Nanak, without good karma, what can anyone
        obtain? He earns what he is pre-destined to receive.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  Sitting together, the companions sing the Songs of
        the Lord's Praises. They praise the Lord's Name continually;
        they are a sacrifice to the Lord. Those who hear, and believe
        in the Lord's Name, to them I am a sacrifice. O Lord, let
        me unite with the Gurmukhs, who are united with You. I am a sacrifice
        to those who, day and night, behold their Guru.  || 8 ||   SHALOK, </p>

      <p> THIRD MEHL:  Without the Name of the Lord, everyone wanders around
        the world, losing. The self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in
        the pitch black darkness of egotism. The Gurmukhs drink in the
        Ambrosial Nectar, O Nanak, contemplating the Word of the Shabad.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  He wakes in peace, and he sleeps in peace.
        The Gurmukh praises the Lord night and day. The self-willed manmukh
        remains deluded by his doubts. He is filled with anxiety, and
        he cannot even sleep. The spiritually wise wake and sleep in peace.
        Nanak is a sacrifice to those who are imbued with the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  They alone meditate on the
        Lord's Name, who are imbued with the Lord. They meditate
        on the One Lord; the One and Only Lord is True. The One Lord is
        pervading everywhere; the One Lord created the Universe. Those
        who meditate on the Lord's Name, cast out their fears. The
        Lord Himself blesses them with Guru's Instruction; the Gurmukh
        meditates on the Lord.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Spiritual
        wisdom, which would bring understanding, does not enter into his
        mind. Without seeing, how can he praise the Lord? The blind act
        in blindness. O Nanak, when one realizes the Word of the Shabad,
        then the Naam comes to abide in the mind.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        There is One Bani; there is One Guru; there is one Shabad to
        contemplate. True is the merchandise, and true is the shop; the
        warehouses are overflowing with jewels. By Guru's Grace,
        they are obtained, if the Great Giver gives them. Dealing in this
        true merchandise, one earns the profit of the incomparable Naam.
        In the midst of poison, the Ambrosial Nectar is revealed; by His
        Mercy, one drinks it in. O Nanak, praise the True Lord; blessed
        is the Creator, the Embellisher.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who
        are permeated by falsehood, do not love the Truth. If someone
        speaks the Truth, falsehood is burnt away. The false are satisfied
        by falsehood, like the crows who eat manure. When the Lord grants
        His Grace, then one meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        As Gurmukh, worship the Lord's Name in adoration; fraud and
        sin shall disappear.  || 10 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Shaykh,
        you wander in the four directions, blown by the four winds; bring
        your mind back to the home of the One Lord. Renounce your petty
        arguments, and realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Bow
        in humble respect before the True Guru; He is the Knower who knows
        everything. Burn away your hopes and desires, and live like a
        guest in this world. If you walk in harmony with the True Guru's
        Will, then you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. O Nanak,
        those who do not contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord  - 
        cursed are their clothes, and cursed is their food.  || 1 || 
        THIRD MEHL:  There is no end to the Lord's Glorious Praises;
        His worth cannot be described. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs chant the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord; they are absorbed in His Glorious
        Virtues.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord has adorned the coat of
        the body; He has embroidered it with devotional worship. The Lord
        has woven His silk into it, in so many ways and fashions. How
        rare is that man of understanding, who understands, and deliberates
        within. He alone understands these deliberations, whom the Lord
        Himself inspires to understand. </p>

      <p> Poor servant Nanak speaks: the Gurmukhs know the Lord, the Lord
        is True.  || 11 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Great men speak the
        teachings by relating them to individual situations, but the whole
        world shares in them. One who becomes Gurmukh knows the Fear of
        God, and realizes his own self. If, by Guru's Grace, one
        remains dead while yet alive, the mind becomes content in itself.
        Those who have no faith in their own minds, O Nanak  -  how
        can they speak of spiritual wisdom?  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Those
        who do not focus their consciousness on the Lord, as Gurmukh,
        suffer pain and grief in the end. They are blind, inwardly and
        outwardly, and they do not understand anything. O Pandit, O religious
        scholar, the whole world is fed for the sake of those who are
        attuned to the Lord's Name. Those who praise the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad, remain blended with the Lord. O Pandit,
        O religious scholar, no one is satisfied, and no one finds true
        wealth through the love of duality. They have grown weary of reading
        scriptures, but still, they do not find contentment, and they
        pass their lives burning, night and day. Their cries and complaints
        never end, and doubt does not depart from within them. O Nanak,
        without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they rise up and depart
        with blackened faces.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O Beloved, lead me to
        meet my True Friend; meeting with Him, I shall ask Him to show
        me the Path. I am a sacrifice to that Friend, who shows it to
        me. I share His Virtues with Him, and meditate on the Lord's
        Name. I serve my Beloved Lord forever; serving the Lord, I have
        found peace. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has imparted
        this understanding to me.  || 12 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O
        Pandit, O religious scholar, your filth shall not be erased, even
        if you read the Vedas for four ages. The three qualities are the
        roots of Maya; in egotism, one forgets the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord. The Pandits are deluded, attached to duality, and they deal
        only in Maya. They are filled with thirst and hunger; the ignorant
        fools starve to death. Serving the True Guru, peace is obtained,
        contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. Hunger and thirst have
        departed from within me; I am in love with the True Name. O Nanak,
        those who are imbued with the Naam, who keep the Lord clasped
        tightly to their hearts, are automatically satisfied.  || 1 ||
        THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh does not serve the Lord's
        Name, and so he suffers in horrible pain. He is filled with the
        darkness of ignorance, and he does not understand anything. Because
        of his stubborn mind, he does not plant the seeds of intuitive
        peace; what will he eat in the world hereafter, to satisfy his
        hunger? He has forgotten the treasure of the Naam; he is caught
        in the love of duality. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are honored with
        glory, when the Lord Himself unites them in His Union.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  The tongue which sings the Lord's Praises, is
        so very beautiful. One who speaks the Lord's Name, with mind,
        body and mouth, is pleasing to the Lord. That Gurmukh tastes the
        the sublime taste of the Lord, and is satisfied. She sings continually
        the Glorious Praises of her Beloved; singing His Glorious Praises,
        she is uplifted. She is blessed with the Lord's Mercy, and
        she chants the Words of the Guru, the True Guru.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  The elephant offers its head to the reins, and the
        anvil offers itself to the hammer; just so, we offer our minds
        and bodies to our Guru; we stand before Him, and serve Him. </p>

      <p> This is how the Gurmukhs eliminate their self-conceit, and come
        to rule the whole world. O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands, when
        the Lord casts His Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Blessed
        and approved is the coming into the world, of those Gurmukhs who
        meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, they save
        their families, and they are honored in the Court of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Guru unites His Sikhs, the Gurmukhs, with
        the Lord. The Guru keeps some of them with Himself, and engages
        others in His Service. Those who cherish their Beloved in their
        conscious minds, the Guru blesses them with His Love. The Guru
        loves all of His Gursikhs equally well, like friends, children
        and siblings. So chant the Name of the Guru, the True Guru, everyone!
        Chanting the Name of the Guru, Guru, you shall be rejuvenated.
        || 14 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, the blind, ignorant
        fools do not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they involve
        themselves in other activities. They are bound and gagged at the
        door of the Messenger of Death; they are punished, and in the
        end, they rot away in manure.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak,
        those humble beings are true and approved, who serve their True
        Guru. They remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord, and their
        comings and goings cease.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Gathering the wealth
        and property of Maya, brings only pain in the end. Homes, mansions
        and adorned palaces will not go with anyone. He may breed horses
        of various colors, but these will not be of any use to him. O
        human, link your consciousness to the Lord's Name, and in
        the end, it shall be your companion and helper. Servant Nanak
        meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukh is blessed
        with peace.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Without the karma
        of good actions, the Name is not obtained; it can be obtained
        only by perfect good karma. O Nanak, if the Lord casts His Glance
        of Grace, then under Guru's Instruction, one is united in
        His Union.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Some are cremated, and some
        are buried; some are eaten by dogs. Some are thrown into water,
        while others are thrown into wells. O Nanak, it is not known,
        where they go and into what they merge.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The
        food and clothes, and all the worldly possessions of those who
        are attuned to the Lord's Name are sacred. All the homes,
        temples, palaces and way-stations are sacred, where the Gurmukhs,
        the selfless servants, the Sikhs and the renouncers of the world,
        go and take their rest. All the horses, saddles and horse blankets
        are sacred, upon which the Gurmukhs, the Sikhs, the Holy and the
        Saints, mount and ride. All the rituals and Dharmic practices
        and deeds are sacred, for those who utter the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, the True Name of the Lord. Those Gurmukhs, those Sikhs,
        who have purity as their treasure, go to their Guru.  || 16 ||
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, forsaking the Name, he loses
        everything, in this world and the next. Chanting, deep meditation
        and austere self-disciplined practices are all wasted; he is deceived
        by the love of duality. He is bound and gagged at the door of
        the Messenger of Death. </p>

      <p> He is beaten, and receives terrible punishment.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  They inflict their hatred upon the Saints, and they love
        the wicked sinners. They find no peace in either this world or
        the next; they are born only to die, again and again. Their hunger
        is never satisfied, and they are ruined by duality. The faces
        of these slanderers are blackened in the Court of the True Lord.
        O Nanak, without the Naam, they find no shelter on either this
        shore, or the one beyond.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who meditate
        on the Lord's Name, are imbued with the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, in their minds. For those who worship the One Lord in
        their conscious minds, there is no other than the One Lord. They
        alone serve the Lord, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny
        is written. They continually sing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord, and singing the Glories of the Glorious Lord, they are uplifted.
        Great is the greatness of the Gurmukhs, who, through the Perfect
        Guru, remain absorbed in the Lord's Name.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  It is very difficult to serve the True Guru; offer
        your head, and eradicate self-conceit. One who dies in the Word
        of the Shabad shall never have to die again; his service is totally
        approved. Touching the philosopher's stone, one becomes the
        philosopher's stone, which transforms lead into gold; remain
        lovingly attached to the True Lord. One who has such pre-ordained
        destiny, comes to meet the True Guru and God. O Nanak, the Lord's
        servant does not meet Him because of his own account; he alone
        is acceptable, whom the Lord forgives.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        The fools do not know the difference between good and bad; they
        are deceived by their self-interests. But if they contemplate
        the Word of the Shabad, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, and their light merges in the Light. The Fear of God
        is always on their minds, and so they come to understand everything.
        The True Guru is pervading the homes within; He Himself blends
        them with the Lord. O Nanak, they meet the True Guru, and all
        their desires are fulfilled, if the Lord grants His Grace and
        so wills.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Blessed, blessed is the good fortune
        of those devotees, who, with their mouths, utter the Name of the
        Lord. Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of those Saints, who,
        with their ears, listen to the Lord's Praises. Blessed, blessed
        is the good fortune of those holy people, who sing the Kirtan
        of the Lord's Praises, and so become virtuous. Blessed, blessed
        is the good fortune of those Gurmukhs, who live as Gursikhs, and
        conquer their minds. But the greatest good fortune of all, is
        that of the Guru's Sikhs, who fall at the Guru's feet.
        || 18 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  One who knows God, and who lovingly
        focuses his attention on the One Word of the Shabad, keeps his
        spirituality intact. The nine treasures and the eighteen spiritual
        powers of the Siddhas follow him, who keeps the Lord enshrined
        in his heart. Without the True Guru, the Name is not found; understand
        this, and reflect upon it. O Nanak, through perfect good destiny,
        one meets the True Guru, and finds peace, throughout the four
        ages.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Whether he is young or old, the
        self-willed manmukh cannot escape hunger and thirst. The Gurmukhs
        are imbued with the Word of the Shabad; they are at peace, having
        lost their self-conceit. They are satisfied and satiated within;
        they never feel hungry again. <br>
