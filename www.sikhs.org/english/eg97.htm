      <p> Prays Nanak, when He brings His play to its close, then only the
        One, the One Lord remains.  || 4 || 4 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Pride, emotional attachment, greed and corruption are gone; I
        have not placed anything else, other than the Lord, within my
        consciousness. I have purchased the jewel of the Naam and the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord; loading this merchandise, I have
        set out on my journey.  || 1 ||   The love which the Lord's
        servant feels for the Lord lasts forever. In my life, I served
        my Lord and Master, and as I depart, I keep Him enshrined in my
        consciousness.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have not turned my face
        away from my Lord and Master's Command. He fills my household
        with celestial peace and bliss; if He asks me to leave, I leave
        at once.  || 2 ||   When I am under the Lord's Command,
        I find even hunger pleasurable; I know no difference between sorrow
        and joy. Whatever the Command of my Lord and Master is, I bow
        my forehead and accept it.  || 3 ||   The Lord and Master has
        become merciful to His servant; He has embellished both this world
        and the next. Blessed is that servant, and fruitful is his birth;
        O Nanak, he realizes his Lord and Master.  || 4 || 5 ||   MARU,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Good karma has dawned for me - my Lord and
        Master has become merciful. I sing the Kirtan of the Praises of
        the Lord, Har, Har. My struggle is ended; I have found peace and
        tranquility. All my wanderings have ceased.  || 1 ||   Now, I
        have obtained the state of eternal life. The Primal Lord, the
        Architect of Destiny, has come into my conscious mind; I seek
        the Sanctuary of the Saints.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sexual desire,
        anger, greed and emotional attachment are eradicated; all my enemies
        are eliminated. He is always ever-present, here and now, watching
        over me; He is never far away.  || 2 ||   In peace and cool tranquility,
        my faith has been totally fulfilled; the Saints are my Helpers
        and Support. He has purified the sinners in an instant; I cannot
        express His Glorious Praises.  || 3 ||   I have become fearless;
        all fear has departed. The feet of the Lord of the Universe are
        my only Shelter. Nanak sings the Praises of his Lord and Master;
        night and day, he is lovingly focused on Him.  || 4 || 6 ||  
        MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  He is all-powerful, the Master of all virtues,
        but you never sing of Him! You shall have to leave all this in
        an instant, but again and again, you chase after it.  || 1 ||
        Why do you not contemplate your God? You are entangled in association
        with your enemies, and the enjoyment of pleasures; your soul is
        burning up with them!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Hearing His Name,
        the Messenger of Death will release you, and yet, you do not enter
        His Sanctuary! Turn out this wretched jackal, and seek the Shelter
        of that  God.  || 2 ||   Praising Him, you shall cross over the
        terrifying world-ocean, and yet, you have not fallen in love with
        Him! This meager, short-lived dream, this thing - you are
        engrossed in it, over and over again.  || 3 ||   When our Lord
        and Master, the ocean of mercy, grants His Grace, one finds honor
        in the Society of the Saints. Says Nanak, I am rid of the illusion
        of the three-phased Maya, when God becomes my help and support.
        || 4 || 7 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts, knows everything; what can anyone hide from Him? <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p> Your hands and feet will fall off in an instant, when you are
        burnt in the fire.  || 1 ||   You fool, you have forgotten the
        Lord from your mind! You eat His salt, and then you are untrue
        to Him; before your very eyes, you shall be torn apart.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The incurable disease has arisen in your body;
        it cannot be removed or overcome. Forgetting God, one endures
        utter agony; this is the essence of reality which Nanak has realized.
        || 2 || 8 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have enshrined the lotus
        feet of God within my consciousness. I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, continually, continuously. There is none other than
        Him at all. He alone exists, in the beginning, in the middle,
        and in the end.  || 1 ||   He Himself is the Shelter of the Saints.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The entire universe is under His control.
        He Himself, the Formless Lord, is Himself by Himself. Nanak holds
        tight to that True Lord. He has found peace, and shall never suffer
        pain again.  || 2 || 9 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">He is the Giver of peace to the breath of
        life, the Giver of life to the soul; how can you forget Him, you
        ignorant person? You taste the weak, insipid wine, and you have
        gone insane. You have uselessly wasted this precious human life.
        || 1 ||   O man, such is the foolishness you practice. Renouncing
        the Lord, the Support of the earth, you wander, deluded by doubt;
        you are engrossed in emotional attachment, associating with Maya,
        the slave-girl.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Abandoning the Lord, the
        Support of the earth, you serve her of lowly ancestry, and you
        pass you life acting egotistically. You do useless deeds, you
        ignorant person; this is why you are called a blind, self-willed
        manmukh.  || 2 ||   That which is true, you believe to be untrue;
        what is transitory, you believe to be permanent. You grasp as
        your own, what belongs to others; in such delusions you are deluded.
        || 3 ||   The Kh'shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaishyas
        all cross over, through the Name of the One Lord. Guru Nanak speaks
        the Teachings; whoever listens to them is carried across.  ||
        4 || 1 || 10 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  You may act in secrecy,
        but God is still with you; you can only deceive other people.
        Forgetting your Dear Lord, you enjoy corrupt pleasures, and so
        you shall have to embrace red-hot pillars.  || 1 ||   O man, why
        do you go out to the households of others? You filthy, heartless,
        lustful donkey! Haven't you heard of the Righteous Judge
        of Dharma?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The stone of corruption is tied
        around your neck, and the load of slander is on your head. You
        must cross over the vast open ocean, but you cannot cross over
        to the other side.  || 2 ||   You are engrossed in sexual desire,
        anger, greed and emotional attachment; you have turned your eyes
        away from the Truth. You cannot even raise your head above the
        water of the vast, impassable sea of Maya.  || 3 ||   The sun
        is liberated, and the moon is liberated; the God-realized being
        is pure and untouched. His inner nature is like that of fire,
        untouched and forever immaculate.  || 4 ||   When good karma dawns,
        the wall of doubt is torn down. <br>

      <p> He lovingly accepts the Guru's Will. One who is blessed
        with the medicine of the GurMantra, the Name of the Lord, O servant
        Nanak, does not suffer the agonies of reincarnation.  || 5 ||
        2 ||   O man, in this way, you shall cross over to the other side.
        Meditate on your Dear Lord, and be dead to the world; renounce
        your love of duality.  ||  Second Pause  || 2 || 11 ||   MARU,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I have quit searching outside; the Guru has shown
        me that God is within the home of my own heart. I have seen God,
        fearless, of wondrous beauty; my mind shall never leave Him to
        go anywhere else.  || 1 ||   I have found the jewel; I have found
        the Perfect Lord. The invaluable value cannot be obtained; in
        His Mercy, the Guru bestows it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Supreme
        Lord God is imperceptible and unfathomable; meeting the Holy Saint,
        I speak the Unspoken Speech. The unstruck sound current of the
        Shabad vibrates and resounds in the Tenth Gate; the Ambrosial
        Naam trickles down there.  || 2 ||   I lack nothing; the thirsty
        desires of my mind are satisfied. The inexhaustible treasure has
        entered into my being. I serve the feet, the feet, the feet of
        the Guru, and manage the unmanageable. I have found the juice,
        the sublime essence.  || 3 ||   Intuitively I come, and intuively
        I go; my mind intuitively plays. Says Nanak, when the Guru drives
        out doubt, then the soul-bride enters the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence.  || 4 || 3 || 12 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  You feel no
        love for the One who created and embellished you. The seed, planted
        out season, does not germinate; it does not produce flower or
        fruit.  || 1 ||   O mind, this is the time to plant the seed of
        the Name. Focus your mind, and cultivate this crop; at the proper
        time, make this your purpose.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Eradicate
        the stubbornness and doubt of your mind, and go to the Sanctuary
        of the True Guru. He alone does such deeds, who has such pre-ordained
        karma.  || 2 ||   He falls in love with the Lord of the Universe,
        and his efforts are approved. My crop has germinated, and it shall
        never be used up.  || 3 ||   I have obtained the priceless wealth,
        which shall never leave me or go anywhere else. Says Nanak, I
        have found peace; I am satisfied and fulfilled.  || 4 || 4 ||
        13 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  The egg of doubt has burst; my mind
        has been enlightened. The Guru has shattered the shackles on my
        feet, and has set me free.  || 1 ||   My coming and going in reincarnation
        is ended. The boiling cauldron has cooled down; the Guru has blessed
        me with the cooling, soothing Naam, the Name of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Since I joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, those who were eyeing me have left. The one who tied
        me up, has released me; what can the Watchman of Death do to me
        now?  || 2 ||   The load of my karma has been removed, and I am
        now free of karma. I have crossed the world-ocean, and reached
        the other shore; the Guru has blessed me with this Dharma.  ||
        3 ||   True is my place, and True is my seat; I have made Truth
        my life's purpose. True is my capital, and True is the
        merchandise, which Nanak has placed into the home of the heart.

      <p> The Pandit, the religious scholar, proclaims the Vedas, but he
        is slow to act on them. Another person on silence sits alone,
        but his heart is tied in knots of desire. Another becomes an Udaasi,
        a renunciate; he abandons his home and walks out on his family,
        but his wandering impulses do not leave him.  || 1 ||   Who can
        I tell about the state of my soul? Where can I find such a person
        who is liberated, and who can unite me with my God?  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Someone may practice intensive meditation, and discipline
        his body, but his mind still runs around in ten directions. The
        celibate practices celibacy, but his heart is filled with pride.
        The Sannyaasi wanders around at sacred shrines of pilgrimage,
        but his mindless anger is still within him.  || 2 ||   The temple
        dancers tie bells around their ankles to earn their living. Others
        go on fasts, take vows, perform the six rituals and wear religious
        robes for show. Some sing songs and melodies and hymns, but their
        minds do not sing of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   The Lord's
        Saints are immaculately pure; they are beyond pleasure and pain,
        beyond greed and attachment. My mind obtains the dust of their
        feet, when the Lord God shows mercy. Says Nanak, I met the Perfect
        Guru, and then the anxiety of my mind was removed.  || 4 ||  
        My Sovereign Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
        The Beloved of my soul knows everything; all trivial talk is forgotten.
        || 1 ||  Second Pause  || 6 || 15 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  One
        who has Your Name in his heart is the king of all the hundreds
        of thousands and millions of beings. Those, whom my True Guru
        has not blessed with Your Name, are poor idiots, who die and are
        reborn.  || 1 ||   My True Guru protects and preserves my honor.
        When You come to mind, Lord, then I obtain perfect honor. Forgetting
        You, I roll in the dust.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The mind's
        pleasures of love and beauty bring just as many blames and sins.
        The Name of the Lord is the treasure of Emancipation; it is absolute
        peace and poise.  || 2 ||   The pleasures of Maya fade away in
        an instant, like the shade of a passing cloud. They alone are
        dyed in the deep crimson of the Lord's Love, who meet the
        Guru, and sing the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   My
        Lord and Master is lofty and exalted, grand and infinite. The
        Darbaar of His Court is inaccessible. Through the Naam, glorious
        greatness and respect are obtained; O Nanak, my Lord and Master
        is my Beloved.  || 4 || 7 || 16 || <br>

        the countries, the continents and all the worlds, have all come
        from the One Word of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Hey - understand
        the Creator Lord. If you meet the True Guru, then you'll
        understand.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He formed the expanse of the
        entire universe from the three gunas, the three qualities. People
        are incarnated in heaven and in hell. In egotism, they come and

      <p> The mind cannot hold still, even for an instant. Without the Guru,
        there is only pitch darkness. Meeting with the True Guru, one
        is emancipated.  || 2 ||   All the deeds done in egotism, are
        just chains around the neck. Harboring self-conceit and self-interest
        is just like placing chains around one's ankles. He alone
        meets with the Guru, and realizes the One Lord, who has such destiny
        written on his forehead.  || 3 ||   He alone meets the Lord, who
        is pleasing to His Mind. He alone is deluded, who is deluded by
        God. No one, by himself, is ignorant or wise. He alone chants
        the Naam, whom the Lord inspires to do so. You have no end or
        limitation. Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You.  || 4
        || 1 || 17 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  Maya, the enticer, has enticed
        the world of the three gunas, the three qualities. The false world
        is engrossed in greed. Crying out, &quot;Mine, mine!&quot;
        they collect possessions, but in the end, they are all deceived.
        || 1 ||   The Lord is fearless, formless and merciful. He is
        the Cherisher of all beings and creatures.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Some collect wealth, and bury it in the ground. Some cannot
        abandon wealth, even in their dreams. The king exercises his power,
        and fills his money-bags, but this fickle companion will not go
        along with him.  || 2 ||   Some love this wealth even more than
        their body and breath of life. Some collect it, forsaking their
        fathers and mothers. Some hide it from their children, friends
        and siblings, but it will not remain with them.  || 3 ||   Some
        become hermits, and sit in meditative trances. Some are Yogis,
        celibates, religious scholars and thinkers. Some dwell in homes,
        graveyards, cremation grounds and forests; but Maya still clings
        to them there.  || 4 ||   When the Lord and Master releases one
        from his bonds, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, comes to dwell
        in his soul. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, His
        humble servants are liberated; O Nanak, they are redeemed and
        enraptured by the Lord's Glance of Grace.  || 5 || 2 ||
        18 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate in remembrance on the One
        Immaculate Lord. No one is turned away from Him empty-handed.
        He cherished and preserved you in your mother's womb; He
        blessed you with body and soul, and embellished you. Each and
        every instant, meditate on that Creator Lord. Meditating in remembrance
        on Him, all faults and mistakes are covered. Enshrine the Lord's
        lotus feet deep within the nucleus of your self. Save your soul
        from the waters of corruption. Your cries and shrieks shall be
        ended; meditating on the Lord of the Universe, your doubts and
        fears shall be dispelled. Rare is that being, who finds the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice
        to Him.  || 1 ||   The Lord's Name is the support of my
        mind and body. Whoever meditates on Him is emancipated.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   He believes that the false thing is true. The
        ignorant fool falls in love with it. He is intoxicated with the
        wine of sexual desire, anger and greed; he loses this human life
        in exchance for a mere shell. He abandons his own, and loves that
        of others. His mind and body are permeated with the intoxication
        of Maya. His thirsty desires are not quenched, although he indulges
        in pleasures. His hopes are not fulfilled, and all his words are
        false. He comes alone, and he goes alone. <br>

      <p> False is all his talk of me and you. The Lord Himself administers
        the poisonous potion, to mislead and delude. O Nanak, the the
        karma of past actions cannot be erased.  || 2 ||   Beasts, birds,
        demons and ghosts - in these many ways, the false wander
        in reincarnation. Wherever they go, they cannot remain there.
        They have no place of rest; they rise up again and again and run
        around. Their minds and bodies are filled with immense, expansive
        desires. The poor wretches are cheated by egotism. They are filled
        with countless sins, and are severely punished. The extent of
        this cannot be estimated. Forgetting God, they fall into hell.
        There are no mothers there, no siblings, no friends and no spouses.
        Those humble beings, unto whom the Lord and Master becomes Merciful,
        O Nanak, cross over.  || 3 ||   Rambling and roaming, wandering
        around, I came to seek the Sanctuary of God. He is the Master
        of the meek, the father and mother of the world. The Merciful
        Lord God is the Destroyer of sorrow and suffering. He emancipates
        whoever He pleases. He lifts them up and pulls him out of the
        deep dark pit. Emancipation comes through loving devotional worship.
        The Holy Saint is the very embodiment of the Lord's form.
        He Himself saves us from the great fire. By myself, I cannot practice
        meditation, austerities, penance and self-discipline. In the beginning
        and in the end, God is inaccessible and unfathomable. Please bless
        me with Your Name, Lord; Your slave begs only for this. O Nanak,
        my Lord God is the Giver of the true state of life.  || 4 || 3
        || 19 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  Why do you try to deceive others,
        O people of the world? The Fascinating Lord is Merciful to the
        meek.  || 1 ||   This is what I have come to know. The brave and
        heroic Guru, the Generous Giver, gives Sanctuary and preserves
        our honor.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He submits to the Will of His
        devotees; He is forever and ever the Giver of peace.  || 2 ||
        Please bless me with Your Mercy, that I may meditate on Your
        Name alone.  || 3 ||   Nanak, the meek and humble, begs for the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord; it eradicates duality and doubt. 
        || 4 || 4 || 20 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  My Lord and Master is
        utterly powerful. I am just His poor servant.  || 1 ||   My Enticing
        Beloved is very dear to my mind and my breath of life. He blesses
        me with His gift.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have seen and tested
        all. There is none other than Him.  || 2 ||   He sustains and
        nurtures all beings. He was, and shall always be.  || 3 ||   Please
        bless me with Your Mercy, O Divine Lord, and link Nanak to Your
        service.  || 4 || 5 || 21 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Redeemer
        of sinners, who carries us across; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. If only I could meet with such
        a Saint, who would inspire me to meditate on the Lord, Har, Har,
        Har.  || 1 ||   No one knows me; I am called Your slave. This
        is my support and sustenance.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You support
        and cherish all; I am meek and humble - this is my only
        prayer. You alone know Your Way; You are the water, and I am the
        fish.  || 2 ||   O Perfect and Expansive Lord and Master, I follow
        You in love. <br>

      <p> O God, You are pervading all the worlds, solar systems and galaxies.
        || 3 ||   You are eternal and unchanging, imperishable, invisible
        and infinite, O divine fascinating Lord. Please bless Nanak with
        the gift of the Society of the Saints, and the dust of the feet
        of Your slaves.  || 4 || 6 || 22 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        Saints are fulfilled and satisfied; they know the Guru's
        Mantra and the Teachings. They cannot even be described; they
        are blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||   My Beloved is a priceless jewel. His Name
        is unattainable and immeasurable.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One whose
        mind is satisfied believing in the imperishable Lord God, becomes
        Gurmukh and attains the essence of spiritual wisdom. He sees all
        in his meditation. He banishes egotistical pride from his mind.
        || 2 ||   Permanent is the place of those who, through the Guru,
        realize the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. Meeting the
        Guru, they remain awake and aware night and day; they are committed
        to the Lord's service.  || 3 ||   They are perfectly fulfilled
        and satisfied, intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi. The Lord's
        treasure comes into their hands; O Nanak, through the Guru, they
        attain it.  || 4 || 7 || 23 || <br>

        You shall not burn in the ocean of fire, and your mind and body
        shall be blessed with peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Like the shade
        of a tree, these things shall pass away, like the clouds blown
        away by the wind. Meeting with the Holy, devotional worship to
        the Lord is implanted within; O Nanak, only this shall work for
        you.  || 2 || 2 || 25 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  The perfect, primal
        Lord is the Giver of peace; He is always with you. He does not
        die, and he does not come or go in reincarnation. He does not
        perish, and He is not affected by heat or cold.  || 1 ||   O my
        mind, be in love with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Within the
        mind, think of the Lord, Har, Har, the treasure. This is the purest

        the One Lord in your mind, renounce your clever tricks, and give

        of sinners; He is the Master of the masterless. In the vast and
        terrifying world-ocean, he is the raft for those who have such
        destiny inscribed on their foreheads.  || 1 ||   Without the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, huge numbers of companions have drowned.
        Even if someone does not remember the Lord, the Cause of causes,
        still, the Lord reaches out with His hand, and saves him.  ||

        in this world. Follow the Guru's Teachings, and contemplate
        it. To work in the love of duality, brings constant loss in this
        world.  || 5 ||   True is one's association, true is one's
        place, and true is one's hearth and home, when one has
        the support of the Naam. Contemplating the True Word of the Guru's
        Bani, and the True Word of the Shabad, one becomes content.  ||
        6 ||   Enjoying princely pleasures, one shall be destroyed in
        pain and pleasure. Adopting a name of greatness, one strings heavy
        sins around his neck. Mankind cannot give gifts; You alone are
        the Giver of everything.  || 7 ||   You are inaccessible and unfathomable;
        O Lord, You are imperishable and infinite. Through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad, seeking at the Lord's Door, one
        finds the treasure of liberation. O Nanak, this union is not broken,
        if one deals in the merchandise of Truth.  || 8 || 1 ||   MARU,
        FIRST MEHL:  The boat is loaded with sin and corruption, and
        launched into the sea. The shore cannot be seen on this side,
        nor on the shore beyond. There are no oars, nor any boatmen, to
        cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||   O Baba, the
        world is caught in the great noose. By Guru's Grace, they
        are saved, contemplating the True Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        The True Guru is the boat; the Word of the Shabad will carry them
        across. There is neither wind nor fire, neither water nor form
        there. The True Name of the True Lord is there; it carries them
        across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukhs reach
        the shore beyond, lovingly focusing on the True Lord. Their comings
        and goings are ended, and their light merges into the Light. Following
        the Guru's Teachings, intuitive peace wells up within them,
        and they remain merged in the True Lord.  || 3 ||   The snake
        may be locked in a basket, but it is still poisonous, and the
        anger within its mind remains. One obtains what is pre-ordained;
        why does he blame others? If one, as Gurmukh, hears and believes
        in the Name, the charm against poison, his mind becomes content.
        || 4 ||   The crocodile is caught by the hook and line; caught
        in the trap of evil-mindedness, he regrets and repents, again
        and again. He does not understand birth and death; the inscription
        of one's past actions cannot be erased.  || 5 ||   Injecting
        the poison of egotism, the world was created; with the Shabad
        enshrined within, the poison is eliminated. Old age cannot torment
        one who remains lovingly absorbed in the True Lord. <br>

      </p>
      <p> He alone is called Jivan-Mikta, liberated while yet alive, from
        within whom egotism is eradicated.  || 6 ||   The world is chasing
        after worldly affairs; caught and bound, it does not understand
        contemplative meditation. The foolish, ignorant, self-willed manmukh
        has forgotten birth and death. Those whom the Guru has protected
        are saved, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad.  || 7 ||
        In the cage of divine love, the parrot, speaks. It pecks at
        the Truth, and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar; it flies away,
        only once. Meeting with the Guru, one recognizes his Lord and
        Master; says Nanak, he finds the gate of liberation.  || 8 ||
        2 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  One who dies in the Word of the Shabad
        conquers death; otherwise, where can you run? Through the Fear
        of God, fear runs away; His Name is Ambrosial Nectar. You alone
        kill and protect; except for You, there is no place at all.  ||
        1 ||   O Baba, I am filthy, shallow and totally without understanding.
        Without the Naam, no one is anything; the Perfect Guru has made
        my intellect perfect.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am full of faults,
        and I have no virtue at all. Without virtues, how can I go home?
        Through the Word of the Shabad, intuitive peace wells up; without
        good destiny, the wealth is not obtained. Those whose minds are
        not filled with the Naam are bound and gagged, and suffer in pain.
        || 2 ||   Those who have forgotten the Naam - why have
        they even come into the world? Here and hereafter, they do not
        find any peace; they have loaded their carts with ashes. Those
        who are separated, do not meet with the Lord; they suffer in terrible
        pain at Death's Door.  || 3 ||   I do not know what will
        happen in the world hereafter; I am so confused - please
        teach me, Lord! I am confused; I would fall at the feet of one
        who shows me the Way. Without the Guru, there is no giver at all;
        His value cannot be described.  || 4 ||   If I see my friend,
        then I will embrace Him; I have sent Him the letter of Truth.
        His soul-bride stands waiting expectantly; as Gurmukh, I see Him
        with my eyes. By the Pleasure of Your Will, You abide in my mind,
        and bless me with Your Glance of Grace.  || 5 ||   One who is
        wandering hungry and thirsty - what can he give, and what
        can anyone ask from him? I cannot conceive of any other, who can
        bless my mind and body with perfection. The One who created me
        takes care of me; He Himself blesses me with glory.  || 6 || 
        In the body-village is my Lord and Master, whose body is ever-new,
        Innocent and child-like, incomparably playful. He is neither a
        woman, nor a man, nor a bird; the True Lord is so wise and beautiful.
        Whatever pleases Him, happens; You are the lamp, and You are the
        incense.  || 7 ||   He hears the songs and tastes the flavors,
        but these flavors are useless and insipid, and bring only disease
        to the body. One who loves the Truth and speaks the Truth, escapes
        from the sorrow of separation. Nanak does not forget the Naam;
        whatever happens is by the Lord's Will.  || 8 || 3 || 
        MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  Practice Truth - other greed and attachments
        are useless. The True Lord has fascinated this mind, and my tongue
        enjoys the taste of Truth. Without the Name, there is no juice;
        the others depart, loaded with poison.  || 1 ||   I am such a
        slave of Yours, O my Beloved Lord and Master. I walk in harmony
        with Your Command, O my True, Sweet Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Night and day, the slave works for his overlord. I have sold
        my mind for the Word of the Guru's Shabad; my mind is comforted
        and consoled by the Shabad. </p>
