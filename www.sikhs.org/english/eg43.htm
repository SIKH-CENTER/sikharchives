      <p> One who meets the True Guru finds peace. He enshrines the Name
        of the Lord in his mind. O Nanak, when the Lord grants His Grace,
        He is obtained. He becomes free of hope and fear, and burns away
        his ego with the Word of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Your
        devotees are pleasing to Your Mind, Lord. They look beautiful
        at Your door, singing Your Praises. O Nanak, those who are denied
        Your Grace, find no shelter at Your Door; they continue wandering.
        Some do not understand their origins, and without cause, they
        display their self-conceit. I am the Lord's minstrel, of
        low social status; others call themselves high caste. I seek those
        who meditate on You.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  False is
        the king, false are the subjects; false is the whole world. False
        is the mansion, false are the skyscrapers; false are those who
        live in them. False is gold, and false is silver; false are those
        who wear them. False is the body, false are the clothes; false
        is incomparable beauty. False is the husband, false is the wife;
        they mourn and waste away. The false ones love falsehood, and
        forget their Creator. With whom should I become friends, if all
        the world shall pass away? False is sweetness, false is honey;
        through falsehood, boat-loads of men have drowned. Nanak speaks
        this prayer: without You, Lord, everything is totally false. 
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  One knows the Truth only when the Truth
        is in his heart. The filth of falsehood departs, and the body
        is washed clean. One knows the Truth only when he bears love to
        the True Lord. Hearing the Name, the mind is enraptured; then,
        he attains the gate of salvation. One knows the Truth only when
        he knows the true way of life. Preparing the field of the body,
        he plants the Seed of the Creator. One knows the Truth only when
        he receives true instruction. Showing mercy to other beings, he
        makes donations to charities. One knows the Truth only when he
        dwells in the sacred shrine of pilgrimage of his own soul. He
        sits and receives instruction from the True Guru, and lives in
        accordance with His Will. Truth is the medicine for all; it removes
        and washes away our sins. Nanak speaks this prayer to those who
        have Truth in their laps.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The gift I seek
        is the dust of the feet of the Saints; if I were to obtain it,
        I would apply it to my forehead. Renounce false greed, and meditate
        single-mindedly on the unseen Lord. As are the actions we commit,
        so are the rewards we receive. If it is so pre-ordained, then
        one obtains the dust of the feet of the Saints. But through small-mindedness,
        we forfeit the merits of selfless service.  || 10 ||   SHALOK,
        FIRST MEHL:  There is a famine of Truth; falsehood prevails,
        and the blackness of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga has turned men
        into demons. Those who planted their seed have departed with honor;
        now, how can the shattered seed sprout? If the seed is whole,
        and it is the proper season, then the seed will sprout. O Nanak,
        without treatment, the raw fabric cannot be dyed. In the Fear
        of God it is bleached white, if the treatment of modesty is applied
        to the cloth of the body. O Nanak, if one is imbued with devotional
        worship, his reputation is not false.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL: 
        Greed and sin are the king and prime minister; falsehood is the
        treasurer. Sexual desire, the chief advisor, is summoned and consulted;
        they all sit together and contemplate their plans. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Their subjects are blind, and without wisdom, they try to please
        the will of the dead. The spiritually wise dance and play their
        musical instruments, adorning themselves with beautiful decorations.
        They shout out loud, and sing epic poems and heroic stories. The
        fools call themselves spiritual scholars, and by their clever
        tricks, they love to gather wealth. The righteous waste their
        righteousness, by asking for the door of salvation. They call
        themselves celibate, and abandon their homes, but they do not
        know the true way of life. Everyone calls himself perfect; none
        call themselves imperfect. If the weight of honor is placed on
        the scale, then, O Nanak, one sees his true weight.  || 2 || 
        FIRST MEHL:  Evil actions become publicly known; O Nanak, the
        True Lord sees everything. Everyone makes the attempt, but that
        alone happens which the Creator Lord does. In the world hereafter,
        social status and power mean nothing; hereafter, the soul is new.
        Those few, whose honor is confirmed, are good.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:
        Only those whose karma You have pre-ordained from the very beginning,
        O Lord, meditate on You. Nothing is in the power of these beings;
        You created the various worlds. Some, You unite with Yourself,
        and some, You lead astray. By Guru's Grace You are known;
        through Him, You reveal Yourself. We are easily absorbed in You.
        || 11 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Suffering is the medicine, and
        pleasure the disease, because where there is pleasure, there is
        no desire for God. You are the Creator Lord; I can do nothing.
        Even if I try, nothing happens.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to
        Your almighty creative power which is pervading everywhere. Your
        limits cannot be known.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your Light is in
        Your creatures, and Your creatures are in Your Light; Your almighty
        power is pervading everywhere. You are the True Lord and Master;
        Your Praise is so beautiful. One who sings it, is carried across.
        Nanak speaks the stories of the Creator Lord; whatever He is to
        do, He does.  || 2 ||   SECOND MEHL:  The Way of Yoga is the Way
        of spiritual wisdom; the Vedas are the Way of the Brahmins. The
        Way of the Khshatriya is the Way of bravery; the Way of the Shudras
        is service to others. The Way of all is the Way of the One; Nanak
        is a slave to one who knows this secret; he himself is the Immaculate
        Divine Lord.  || 3 ||   SECOND MEHL:  The One Lord Krishna is
        the Divine Lord of all; He is the Divinity of the individual soul.
        Nanak is a slave to anyone who understands this mystery of the
        all-pervading Lord; he himself is the Immaculate Divine Lord.
        || 4 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Water remains confined within the pitcher,
        but without water, the pitcher could not have been formed; just
        so, the mind is restrained by spiritual wisdom, but without the
        Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom.  || 5 ||   PAUREE:  If an
        educated person is a sinner, then the illiterate holy man is not
        to be punished. As are the deeds done, so is the reputation one
        acquires. So do not play such a game, which will bring you to
        ruin at the Court of the Lord. The accounts of the educated and
        the illiterate shall be judged in the world hereafter. </p>

      </p>
      <p> One who stubbornly follows his own mind shall suffer in the world
        hereafter.  || 12 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, the soul
        of the body has one chariot and one charioteer. In age after age
        they change; the spiritually wise understand this. In the Golden
        Age of Sat Yuga, contentment was the chariot and righteousness
        the charioteer. In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, celibacy was
        the chariot and power the charioteer. In the Brass Age of Dwaapar
        Yuga, penance was the chariot and truth the charioteer. In the
        Iron Age of Kali Yuga, fire is the chariot and falsehood the charioteer.
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The Sama Veda says that the Lord Master
        is robed in white; in the Age of Truth, everyone desired Truth,
        abided in Truth, and was merged in the Truth. The Rig Veda says
        that God is permeating and pervading everywhere; among the deities,
        the Lord's Name is the most exalted. Chanting the Name, sins
        depart; O Nanak, then, one obtains salvation. In the Jujar Veda,
        Kaan Krishna of the Yaadva tribe seduced Chandraavali by force.
        He brought the Elysian Tree for his milk-maid, and revelled in
        Brindaaban. In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Atharva Veda became
        prominent; Allah became the Name of God. Men began to wear blue
        robes and garments; Turks and Pat'haans assumed power. The
        four Vedas each claim to be true. Reading and studying them, four
        doctrines are found. With loving devotional worship, abiding in
        humility, O Nanak, salvation is attained.  || 2 ||   PAUREE: 
        I am a sacrifice to the True Guru; meeting Him, I have come to
        cherish the Lord Master. He has taught me and given me the healing
        ointment of spiritual wisdom, and with these eyes, I behold the
        world. Those dealers who abandon their Lord and Master and attach
        themselves to another, are drowned. The True Guru is the boat,
        but few are those who realize this. Granting His Grace, He carries
        them across.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  The simmal tree
        is straight as an arrow; it is very tall, and very thick. But
        those birds which visit it hopefully, depart disappointed. Its
        fruits are tasteless, its flowers are nauseating, and its leaves
        are useless. Sweetness and humility, O Nanak, are the essence
        of virtue and goodness. Everyone bows down to himself; no one
        bows down to another. When something is placed on the balancing
        scale and weighed, the side which descends is heavier. The sinner,
        like the deer hunter, bows down twice as much. But what can be
        achieved by bowing the head, when the heart is impure?  || 1 ||
        FIRST MEHL:  You read your books and say your prayers, and then
        engage in debate; you worship stones and sit like a stork, pretending
        to be in Samaadhi. With your mouth you utter falsehood, and you
        adorn yourself with precious decorations; you recite the three
        lines of the Gayatri three times a day. Around your neck is a
        rosary, and on your forehead is a sacred mark; upon your head
        is a turban, and you wear two loin cloths. If you knew the nature
        of God, you would know that all of these beliefs and rituals are
        in vain. Says Nanak, meditate with deep faith; without the True
        Guru, no one finds the Way.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Abandoning the
        world of beauty, and beautiful clothes, one must depart. He obtains
        the rewards of his good and bad deeds. </p>

      <p> He may issue whatever commands he wishes, but he shall have to
        take to the narrow path hereafter. He goes to hell naked, and
        he looks hideous then. He regrets the sins he committed.  || 14
        ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Make compassion the cotton, contentment
        the thread, modesty the knot and truth the twist. This is the
        sacred thread of the soul; if you have it, then go ahead and put
        it on me. It does not break, it cannot be soiled by filth, it
        cannot be burnt, or lost. Blessed are those mortal beings, O Nanak,
        who wear such a thread around their necks. You buy the thread
        for a few shells, and seated in your enclosure, you put it on.
        Whispering instructions into others' ears, the Brahmin becomes
        a guru. But he dies, and the sacred thread falls away, and the
        soul departs without it.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  He commits thousands
        of robberies, thousands of acts of adultery, thousands of falsehoods
        and thousands of abuses. He practices thousands of deceptions
        and secret deeds, night and day, against his fellow beings. The
        thread is spun from cotton, and the Brahmin comes and twists it.
        The goat is killed, cooked and eaten, and everyone then says,
  &quot;Put on the sacred thread.&quot; When it wears out, it is
        thrown away, and another one is put on. O Nanak, the thread would
        not break, if it had any real strength.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        Believing in the Name, honor is obtained. The Lord's Praise
        is the true sacred thread. Such a sacred thread is worn in the
        Court of the Lord; it shall never break.  || 3 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        There is no sacred thread for the sexual organ, and no thread
        for woman. The man's beard is spat upon daily. There is no
        sacred thread for the feet, and no thread for the hands; no thread
        for the tongue, and no thread for the eyes. The Brahmin himself
        goes to the world hereafter without a sacred thread. Twisting
        the threads, he puts them on others. He takes payment for performing
        marriages; reading their horoscopes, he shows them the way. Hear,
        and see, O people, this wondrous thing. He is mentally blind,
        and yet his name is wisdom.  || 4 ||   PAUREE:  One, upon whom
        the Merciful Lord bestows His Grace, performs His service. That
        servant, whom the Lord causes to obey the Order of His Will, serves
        Him. Obeying the Order of His Will, he becomes acceptable, and
        then, he obtains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. One
        who acts to please His Lord and Master, obtains the fruits of
        his mind's desires. Then, he goes to the Court of the Lord,
        wearing robes of honor.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  They
        tax the cows and the Brahmins, but the cow-dung they apply to
        their kitchen will not save them. They wear their loin cloths,
        apply ritual frontal marks to their foreheads, and carry their
        rosaries, but they eat food with the Muslims. O Siblings of Destiny,
        you perform devotional worship indoors, but read the Islamic sacred
        texts, and adopt the Muslim way of life. Renounce your hypocrisy!
        Taking the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you shall swim across.
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The man-eaters say their prayers. Those
        who wield the knife wear the sacred thread around their necks.
        In their homes, the Brahmins sound the conch. They too have the
        same taste. False is their capital, and false is their trade.
        Speaking falsehood, they take their food. The home of modesty
        and Dharma is far from them. O Nanak, they are totally permeated
        with falsehood. The sacred marks are on their foreheads, and the
        saffron loin-cloths are around their waists; in their hands they
        hold the knives  -  they are the butchers of the world! </p>

      </p>
      <p> Wearing blue robes, they seek the approval of the Muslim rulers.
        Accepting bread from the Muslim rulers, they still worship the
        Puraanas. They eat the meat of the goats, killed after the Muslim
        prayers are read over them, but they do not allow anyone else
        to enter their kitchen areas. They draw lines around them, plastering
        the ground with cow-dung. The false come and sit within them.
        They cry out, &quot;Do not touch our food, or it will be polluted!&quot;
        But with their polluted bodies, they commit evil deeds. With filthy
        minds, they try to cleanse their mouths. Says Nanak, meditate
        on the True Lord. If you are pure, you will obtain the True Lord.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  All are within Your mind; You see and move
        them under Your Glance of Grace, O Lord. You Yourself grant them
        glory, and You Yourself cause them to act. The Lord is the greatest
        of the great; great is His world. He enjoins all to their tasks.
        If he should cast an angry glance, He can transform kings into
        blades of grass. Even though they may beg from door to door, no
        one will give them charity.  || 16 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL: 
        The thief robs a house, and offers the stolen goods to his ancestors.
        In the world hereafter, this is recognized, and his ancestors
        are considered thieves as well. The hands of the go-between are
        cut off; this is the Lord's justice. O Nanak, in the world
        hereafter, that alone is received, which one gives to the needy
        from his own earnings and labor.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  As a
        woman has her periods, month after month, so does falsehood dwell
        in the mouth of the false; they suffer forever, again and again.
        They are not called pure, who sit down after merely washing their
        bodies. Only they are pure, O Nanak, within whose minds the Lord
        abides.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  With saddled horses, as fast as the
        wind, and harems decorated in every way; in houses and pavilions
        and lofty mansions, they dwell, making ostentatious shows. They
        act out their minds' desires, but they do not understand
        the Lord, and so they are ruined. Asserting their authority, they
        eat, and beholding their mansions, they forget about death. But
        old age comes, and youth is lost.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        If one accepts the concept of impurity, then there is impurity
        everywhere. In cow-dung and wood there are worms. As many as are
        the grains of corn, none is without life. First, there is life
        in the water, by which everything else is made green. How can
        it be protected from impurity? It touches our own kitchen. O Nanak,
        impurity cannot be removed in this way; it is washed away only
        by spiritual wisdom.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The impurity of the
        mind is greed, and the impurity of the tongue is falsehood. The
        impurity of the eyes is to gaze upon the beauty of another man's
        wife, and his wealth. The impurity of the ears is to listen to
        the slander of others. O Nanak, the mortal's soul goes, bound
        and gagged to the city of Death.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  All impurity
        comes from doubt and attachment to duality. Birth and death are
        subject to the Command of the Lord's Will; through His Will
        we come and go. Eating and drinking are pure, since the Lord gives
        nourishment to all. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, the Gurmukhs, who understand the Lord, are not stained
        by impurity.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  Praise the Great True Guru; within
        Him is the greatest greatness. When the Lord causes us to meet
        the Guru, then we come to see them. When it pleases Him, they
        come to dwell in our minds. By His Command, when He places His
        hand on our foreheads, wickedness departs from within. When the
        Lord is thoroughly pleased, the nine treasures are obtained. 
        || 18 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  First, purifying himself, the
        Brahmin comes and sits in his purified enclosure. The pure foods,
        which no one else has touched, are placed before him. Being purified,
        he takes his food, and begins to read his sacred verses. But it
        is then thrown into a filthy place  -  whose fault is this?
        The corn is sacred, the water is sacred; the fire and salt are
        sacred as well; when the fifth thing, the ghee, is added, then
        the food becomes pure and sanctified. Coming into contact with
        the sinful human body, the food becomes so impure that is is spat
        upon. That mouth which does not chant the Naam, and without the
        Name eats tasty foods  -  O Nanak, know this: such a mouth
        is to be spat upon.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  From woman, man is
        born; within woman, man is conceived; to woman he is engaged and
        married. Woman becomes his friend; through woman, the future generations
        come. When his woman dies, he seeks another woman; to woman he
        is bound. So why call her bad? From her, kings are born. From
        woman, woman is born; without woman, there would be no one at
        all. O Nanak, only the True Lord is without a woman. That mouth
        which praises the Lord continually is blessed and beautiful. O
        Nanak, those faces shall be radiant in the Court of the True Lord.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  All call You their own, Lord; one who does
        not own You, is picked up and thrown away. Everyone receives the
        rewards of his own actions; his account is adjusted accordingly.
        Since one is not destined to remain in this world anyway, why
        should he ruin himself in pride? Do not call anyone bad; read
        these words, and understand. Don't argue with fools.  ||
        19 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, speaking insipid words,
        the body and mind become insipid. He is called the most insipid
        of the insipid; the most insipid of the insipid is his reputation.
        The insipid person is discarded in the Court of the Lord, and
        the insipid one's face is spat upon. The insipid one is called
        a fool; he is beaten with shoes in punishment.  || 1 ||   FIRST
        MEHL:  Those who are false within, and honorable on the outside,
        are very common in this world. Even though they may bathe at the
        sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, still, their filth does
        not depart. Those who have silk on the inside and rags on the
        outside, are the good ones in this world. They embrace love for
        the Lord, and contemplate beholding Him. In the Lord's Love,
        they laugh, and in the Lord's Love, they weep, and also keep
        silent. They do not care for anything else, except their True
        Husband Lord. Sitting, waiting at the Lord's Door, they beg
        for food, and when He gives to them, they eat. There is only One
        Court of the Lord, and He has only one pen; there, you and I shall
        meet. In the Court of the Lord, the accounts are examined; O Nanak,
        the sinners are crushed, like oil seeds in the press.  || </p>

      <p> 2 ||   PAUREE:  You Yourself created the creation; You Yourself
        infused Your power into it. You behold Your creation, like the
        losing and winning dice of the earth. Whoever has come, shall
        depart; all shall have their turn. He who owns our soul, and our
        very breath of life  -  why should we forget that Lord and
        Master from our minds? With our own hands, let us resolve our
        own affairs.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  What sort of love
        is this, which clings to duality? O Nanak, he alone is called
        a lover, who remains forever immersed in absorption. But one who
        feels good only when good is done for him, and feels bad when
        things go badly  -  do not call him a lover. He trades only
        for his own account.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  One who offers both
        respectful greetings and rude refusal to his master, has gone
        wrong from the very beginning. O Nanak, both of his actions are
        false; he obtains no place in the Court of the Lord.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  Serving Him, peace is obtained; meditate and dwell
        upon that Lord and Master forever. Why do you do such evil deeds,
        that you shall have to suffer so? Do not do any evil at all; look
        ahead to the future with foresight. So throw the dice in such
        a way, that you shall not lose with your Lord and Master. Do those
        deeds which shall bring you profit.  || 21 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND
        MEHL:  If a servant performs service, while being vain and argumentative,
        he may talk as much as he wants, but he shall not be pleasing
        to his Master. But if he eliminates his self-conceit and then
        performs service, he shall be honored. O Nanak, if he merges with
        the one with whom he is attached, his attachment becomes acceptable.
        || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Whatever is in the mind, comes forth;
        spoken words by themselves are just wind. He sows seeds of poison,
        and demands Ambrosial Nectar. Behold  -  what justice is this?
        || 2 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Friendship with a fool never works out
        right. As he knows, he acts; behold, and see that it is so. One
        thing can be absorbed into another thing, but duality keeps them
        apart. No one can issue commands to the Lord Master; offer instead
        humble prayers. Practicing falsehood, only falsehood is obtained.
        O Nanak, through the Lord's Praise, one blossoms forth. 
        || 3 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Friendship with a fool, and love with
        a pompous person, are like lines drawn in water, leaving no trace
        or mark.  || 4 ||   SECOND MEHL:  If a fool does a job, he cannot
        do it right. Even if he does something right, he does the next
        thing wrong.  || 5 ||   PAUREE:  If a servant, performing service,
        obeys the Will of his Master, his honor increases, and he receives
        double his wages. But if he claims to be equal to his Master,
        he earns his Master's displeasure. He loses his entire salary,
        and is also beaten on his face with shoes. Let us all celebrate
        Him, from whom we receive our nourishment. O Nanak, no one can
        issue commands to the Lord Master; let us offer prayers instead.
        || 22 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  What sort of gift is this,
        which we receive only by our own asking? O Nanak, that is the
        most wonderful gift, which is received from the Lord, when He
        is totally pleased.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL: </p>

      </p>
      <p> What sort of service is this, by which the fear of the Lord Master
        does not depart? O Nanak, he alone is called a servant, who merges
        with the Lord Master.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O Nanak, the Lord's
        limits cannot be known; He has no end or limitation. He Himself
        creates, and then He Himself destroys. Some have chains around
        their necks, while some ride on many horses. He Himself acts,
        and He Himself causes us to act. Unto whom should I complain?
        O Nanak, the One who created the creation  -  He Himself takes
        care of it.  || 23 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  He Himself fashioned
        the vessel of the body, and He Himself fills it. Into some, milk
        is poured, while others remain on the fire. Some lie down and
        sleep on soft beds, while others remain watchful. He adorns those,
        O Nanak, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||   SECOND
        MEHL:  He Himself creates and fashions the world, and He Himself
        keeps it in order. Having created the beings within it, He oversees
        their birth and death. Unto whom should we speak, O Nanak, when
        He Himself is all-in-all?  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The description
        of the greatness of the Great Lord cannot be described. He is
        the Creator, all-lowerful and benevolent; He gives sustenance
        to all beings. The mortal does that work, which has been pre-destined
        from the very beginning. O Nanak, except for the One Lord, there
        is no other place at all. He does whatever He wills.  || 24 ||

      </center>
      <p> Falling at the Feet of the Guru, I pray, and ask Him, &quot;Why
        was man created? What deeds cause the world to come into being,
        and be destroyed? Tell me, that I may understand.&quot;  || 1
        ||   O Divine Guru, please, show Mercy to me, and place me on
        the right path, by which the bonds of fear may be cut away. The
        pains of birth and death come from past actions and karma; peace
        comes when the soul finds release from reincarnation.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The mortal does not break free from the bonds of
        the noose of Maya, and he does not seek the shelter of the profound,
        absolute Lord. He does not realize the dignity of the self, and
        Nirvaanaa; because of this, his doubt does not depart.  || 2 ||
        The soul is not born, even though he thinks it is born; it is
        free from birth and death. When the mortal gives up his ideas
        of birth and death, he remains constantly absorbed in the Lord's
        Love.  || 3 ||   As the reflection of an object blends in the
        water when the pitcher is broken, says Kabeer, just so virtue
        dispels doubt, and then the soul is absorbed in the profound,
        absolute Lord. </p>

      <p> || 4 || 1 ||   AASAA:  They wear loin cloths, three and a half
        yards long, and triple-wound sacred threads. They have rosaries
        around their necks, and they carry glittering jugs in their hands.
        They are not called Saints of the Lord  -  they are thugs of
        Benares.  || 1 ||   Such 'saints' are not pleasing to
        me; they eat the trees along with the branches.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   They wash their pots and pans before putting them on the
        stove, and they wash the wood before lighting it. They dig up
        the earth and make two fireplaces, but they eat the whole person!
        || 2 ||   Those sinners continually wander in evil deeds, while
        they call themselves touch-nothing saints. They wander around
        forever and ever in their self-conceit, and all their families
        are drowned.  || 3 ||   He is attached to that, to which the Lord
        has attached him, and he acts accordingly. Says Kabeer, one who
        meets the True Guru, is not reincarnated again.  || 4 || 2 ||
        AASAA:  My Father has comforted me. He has given me a cozy bed,
        and placed His Ambrosial Nectar in my mouth. How could I forget
        that Father from my mind? When I go to the world hereafter, I
        shall not lose the game.  || 1 ||   Maya is dead, O mother, and
        I am very happy. I do not wear the patched coat, nor do I feel
        the chill.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am a sacrifice to my Father,
        who gave me life. He put an end to my association with the five
        deadly sins. I have conquered those five demons, and trampled
        them underfoot. Remembering the Lord in meditation, my mind and
        body are drenched with His Love.  || 2 ||   My Father is the Great
        Lord of the Universe. How shall I go to that Father? When I met
        the True Guru, He showed me the Way. The Father of the Universe
        is pleasing to my mind.  || 3 ||   I am Your son, and You are
        my Father. We both dwell in the same place. Says Kabeer, the Lord's
        humble servant knows only the One. By Guru's Grace, I have
        come to know everything.  || 4 || 3 ||   AASAA:  In one pot, they
        put a boiled chicken, and in the other pot, they put wine. The
        five Yogis of the Tantric ritual sit there, and in their midst
        sits the noseless one, the shameless queen.  || 1 ||   The bell
        of the shameless queen, Maya, rings in both worlds. Some rare
        person of discriminating wisdom has cut off your nose.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Within all dwells the noseless Maya, who kills all,
        and destroys them. She says, &quot;I am the sister, and the daughter
        of the sister of everyone; I am the hand-maiden of one who marries
        me.&quot;  || 2 ||   My Husband is the Great One of discriminating
        wisdom; He alone is called a Saint. He stands by me, and no one
        else comes near me.  || 3 ||   I have cut off her nose, and cut
        off her ears, and cutting her into bits, I have expelled her.
        Says Kabeer, she is the darling of the three worlds, but the enemy
        of the Saints.  || 4 || 4 ||   AASAA:  The Yogis, celibates, penitents
        and Sannyaasees make pilgrimages to all the sacred places. The
        Jains with shaven heads, the silent ones, the beggars with matted
        hair  -  in the end, they all shall die.  || 1 ||   Meditate,
        therefore, on the Lord. What can the Messenger of Death do to
        one whose tongue loves the Name of the Lord?  || 1 ||  Pause

        rules of grammar of many languages; those who know Tantras and
        mantras and all medicines  -  even they shall die in the end.
        || 2 ||   Those who enjoy regal power and rule, royal canopies
        and thrones, many beautiful women, betel nuts, camphor and fragrant
        sandalwood oil  -  in the end, they too shall die.  || 3 ||
        I have searched all the Vedas, Puraanas and Simritees, but none
        of these can save anyone. Says Kabeer, meditate on the Lord, and
        eliminate birth and death.  || 4 || 5 ||   AASAA:  The elephant
        is the guitar player, the ox is the drummer, and the crow plays
        the cymbals. Putting on the skirt, the donkey dances around, and
        the water buffalo performs devotional worship.  || 1 ||   The
        Lord, the King, has cooked the cakes of ice, but only the rare
        man of understanding eats them.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sitting
        in his den, the lion prepares the betel leaves, and the muskrat
        brings the betel nuts. Going from house to house, the mouse sings
        the songs of joy, and the turtle blows on the conch-shell.  ||
        2 ||   The son of the sterile woman goes to get married, and the
        golden canopy is spread out for him. He marries a beautiful and
        enticing young woman; the rabbit and the lion sing their praises.
        || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints  -  the ant has eaten
        the mountain. The turtle says, &quot;I need a burning coal, also.&quot;
        Listen to this mystery of the Shabad.  || 4 || 6 ||   AASAA: 
        The body is a bag with seventy-two chambers, and one opening,
        the Tenth Gate. He alone is a real Yogi on this earth, who asks
        for the primal world of the nine regions.  || 1 ||   Such a Yogi
        obtains the nine treasures. He lifts his soul up from below, to
        the skies of the Tenth Gate.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He makes spiritual
        wisdom his patched coat, and meditation his needle. He twists
        the thread of the Word of the Shabad. Making the five elements
        his deer skin to sit on, he walks on the Guru's Path.  ||
        2 ||   He makes compassion his shovel, his body the firewood,
        and he kindles the fire of divine vision. He places love within
        his heart, and he remains in deep meditation throughout the four
        ages.  || 3 ||   All Yoga is in the Name of the Lord; the body
        and the breath of life belong to Him. Says Kabeer, if God grants
        His Grace, He bestows the insignia of Truth.  || 4 || 7 ||   AASAA:
        Where have the Hindus and Muslims come from? Who put them on
        their different paths? Think of this, and contemplate it within
        your mind, O men of evil intentions. Who will go to heaven and
        hell?  || 1 ||   O Qazi, which book have you read? Such scholars
        and students have all died, and none of them have discovered the
        inner meaning.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Because of the love of woman,
        circumcision is done; I don't believe in it, O Siblings of
        Destiny. If God wished me to be a Muslim, it would be cut off
        by itself.  || 2 ||  If circumcision makes one a Muslim, then
        what about a woman? She is the other half of a man's body,
        and she does not leave him, so he remains a Hindu.  || 3 ||  
        Give up your holy books, and remember the Lord, you fool, and
        stop oppressing others so badly. Kabeer has grasped hold of the
        Lord's Support, and the Muslims have utterly failed.  ||

        Pause  ||   Tell me, whose mother is that, whose father is that,
        and which man has a wife? When the pitcher of the body breaks,
        no one cares for you at all. Everyone says, &quot;Take him away,
        take him away!&quot;  || 2 ||   Sitting on the threshold, his
        mother cries, and his brothers take away the coffin. Taking down
        her hair, his wife cries out in sorrow, and the swan-soul departs
        all alone.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints, about the
        terrifying world-ocean. This human suffers torture and the Messenger
        of Death will not leave him alone, O Lord of the World.  || 4

        use the stick of your mind to churn it. Gather the curds of the
        Word of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   The churning of the Lord is to
