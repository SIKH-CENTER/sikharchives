      <p> He alone attains the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace. He Himself
        unites in His Union.  || 2 ||   Uniting with Himself, He bestows
        glorious greatness. By Guru's Grace, one comes to know
        the Lord's worth. The self-willed manmukh wanders everywhere,
        weeping and wailing; he is utterly ruined by the love of duality.
        || 3 ||   Egotism was instilled into the illusion of Maya. The
        self-willed manmukh is deluded, and loses his honor. But one who
        becomes Gurmukh is absorbed in the Name; he remains immersed in
        the True Lord.  || 4 ||   Spiritual wisdom is obtained from the
        Guru, along with the jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        Desires are subdued, and one remains immersed in the mind. The
        Creator Himself stages all His plays; He Himself bestows understanding.
        || 5 ||   One who serves the True Guru eradicates self-conceit.
        Meeting with his Beloved, he finds peace through the Word of the
        Shabad. Deep within his inner being, he is imbued with loving
        devotion; intuitively, he becomes one with the Lord.  || 6 ||
        The Destroyer of pain is known through the Guru. The Great Giver,
        the Life of the world, Himself has met me. He alone understands,
        whom the Lord joins with Himself. Fear and doubt are taken away
        from his body.  || 7 ||   He Himself is the Gurmukh, and He Himself
        bestows His blessings. Through the True Word of the Shabad, serve
        the True Guru. Old age and death cannot even touch one who is
        in harmony with the True Lord.  || 8 ||   The world is burning
        up in the fire of desire. It burns and burns, and is destroyed
        in all its corruption. The self-willed manmukh finds no place
        of rest anywhere. The True Guru has imparted this understanding.
        || 9 ||   Those who serve the True Guru are very fortunate. They
        remain lovingly focused on the True Name forever. The Immaculate
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, permeates the nucleus of their inner
        being; through the Shabad, their desires are quenched.  || 10
        ||   True is the Word of the Shabad, and True is the Bani of His
        Word. How rare is that Gurmukh who realizes this. Those who are
        imbued with the True Shabad are detached. Their comings and goings
        in reincarnation are ended.  || 11 ||   One who realizes the Shabad
        is cleansed of impurities. The Immaculate Naam abides within his
        mind. He serves his True Guru forever, and egotism is eradicated
        from within.  || 12 ||   If one comes to understand, through the
        Guru, then he comes to know the Lord's Door. But without
        the Naam, one babbles and argues in vain. The glory of serving
        the True Guru is that it eradicates hunger and thirst.  || 13
        ||   When the Lord unites them with Himself, then they come to
        understand. Without spiritual wisdom, they understand nothing
        at all. One whose mind is filled with the Guru's gift forever
        - his inner being resounds with the Shabad, and the Word
        of the Guru's Bani.  || 14 ||   He acts according to his
        pre-ordained destiny. No one can erase the Command of the Primal
        Lord. They alone dwell in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
        who have such pre-ordained destiny.  || 15 ||   He alone finds
        the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace. He links his consciousness
        to the deep meditative state of the True Shabad. Nanak, Your slave,
        offers this humble prayer; I stand at Your Door, begging for Your
        Name.  || 16 || 1 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  The One and only Lord
        is pervading and permeating everywhere. How rare is that person,
        who as Gurmukh, understands this. The One Lord is permeating and
        pervading, deep within the nucleus of all. Without Him, there
        is no other at all.  || 1 ||   He created the 8.4 millions species
        of beings. <br>

      <p> The spiritual teachers and meditators proclaim this. He Himself
        nourishes all; no one else can estimate His value.  || 2 ||  
        Love and attachment to Maya are utter darkness. Egotism and possessiveness
        have spread throughout the expanse of the universe. Night and
        day, they burn, day and night; without the Guru, there is no peace
        or tranquility.  || 3 ||   He Himself unites, and He Himself separates.
        He Himself establishes, and He Himself disestablishes. True is
        the Hukam of His Command, and True is the expanse of His universe.
        No one else can issue any Command.  || 4 ||   He alone is attached
        to the Lord, whom the Lord attaches to Himself. By Guru's
        Grace, the fear of death runs away. The Shabad, the Giver of peace,
        dwells forever deep within the nucleus of the self. One who is
        Gurmukh understands.  || 5 ||   God Himself unites those united
        in His Union. Whatever is pre-ordained by destiny, cannot be erased.
        Night and day, His devotees worship Him, day and night; one who
        becomes Gurmukh serves Him.  || 6 ||   Serving the True Guru,
        lasting peace is experienced. He Himself, the Giver of all, has
        come and met me. Subduing egotism, the fire of thirst has been
        extinguished; contemplating the Word of the Shabad, peace is found.
        || 7 ||   One who is attached to his body and family, does not
        understand. But one who becomes Gurmukh, sees the Lord with his
        eyes. Night and day, he chants the Naam, day and night; meeting
        with his Beloved, he finds peace.  || 8 ||   The self-willed manmukh
        wanders distracted, attached to duality. That unfortunate wretch
        - why didn't he just die as soon as he was born?
        Coming and going, he wastes away his life in vain. Without the
        Guru, liberation is not obtained.  || 9 ||   That body which is
        stained with the filth of egotism is false and impure. It may
        be washed a hundred times, but its filth is still not removed.
        But if it is washed with the Word of the Shabad, then it is truly
        cleansed, and it shall never be soiled again.  || 10 ||   The
        five demons destroy the body. He dies and dies again, only to
        be reincarnated; he does not contemplate the Shabad. The darkness
        of emotional attachment to Maya is within his inner being; as
        if in a dream, he does not understand.  || 11 ||   Some conquer
        the five demons, by being attached to the Shabad. They are blessed
        and very fortunate; the True Guru comes to meet them. Within the
        nucleus of their inner being, they dwell upon the Truth; attuned
        to the Lord's Love, they intuitively merge in Him.  ||
        12 ||   The Guru's Way is known through the Guru. His perfect
        servant attains realization through the Shabad. Deep within his
        heart, he dwells forever upon the Shabad; he tastes the sublime
        essence of the True Lord with his tongue.  || 13 ||   Egotism
        is conquered and subdued by the Shabad. I have enshrined the Name
        of the Lord within my heart. Other than the One Lord, I know nothing
        at all. Whatever will be, will automatically be.  || 14 ||   Without
        the True Guru, no one obtains intuitive wisdom. The Gurmukh understands,
        and is immersed in the True Lord. He serves the True Lord, and
        is attuned to the True Shabad. The Shabad banishes egotism.  ||
        15 ||   He Himself is the Giver of virtue, the Contemplative Lord.
        The Gurmukh is given the winning dice. O Nanak, immersed in the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, one becomes true; from the True Lord,
        honor is obtained.  || 16 || 2 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  One One
        True Lord is the Life of the World, the Great Giver. <br>

      <p> Serving the Guru, through the Word of the Shabad, He is realized.
        There is only One Command, and there is only One Supreme King.
        In each and every age, He links each to their tasks.  || 1 ||
        That humble being is immaculate, who knows his own self. The
        Lord, the Giver of peace, Himself comes and meets him. His tongue
        is imbued with the Shabad, and he sings the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord; he is honored in the Court of the True Lord.  || 2 ||
        The Gurmukh is blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam.
        The self-willed manmukh, the slanderer, loses his honor. Attuned
        to the Naam, the supreme soul-swans remain detached; in the home
        of the self, they remain absorbed in deep meditative trance. 
        || 3 ||   That humble being who dies in the Shabad is perfect.
        The brave, heroic True Guru chants and proclaims this. Deep within
        the body is the true pool of Ambrosial Nectar; the mind drinks
        it in with loving devotion.  || 4 ||   The Pandit, the religious
        scholar, reads and instructs others, but he does not realize that
        his own home is on fire. Without serving the True Guru, the Naam
        is not obtained. You can read until you are exhausted, but you
        shall not find peace and tranquility.  || 5 ||   Some smear their
        bodies with ashes, and wander around in religious disguises. Without
        the Word of the Shabad, who has ever subdued egotism? Night and
        day, they continue burning, day and night; they are deluded and
        confused by their doubt and religious costumes.  || 6 ||   Some,
        in the midst of their household and family, remain always unattached.
        They die in the Shabad, and dwell in the Lord's Name. Night
        and day, they remain forever attuned to His Love; they focus their
        consciousness on loving devotion and the Fear of God.  || 7 ||
        The self-willed manmukh indulges in slander, and is ruined.
        The dog of greed barks within him. The Messenger of Death never
        leaves him, and in the end, he leaves, regretting and repenting.
        || 8 ||   Through the True Word of the Shabad, true honor is
        obtained. Without the Name, no one attains liberation. Without
        the True Guru, no one finds the Name. Such is the making which
        God has made.  || 9 ||   Some are Siddhas and seekers, and great
        contemplators. Some remain imbued with the Naam, the Name of the
        Formless Lord, day and night. He alone understands, whom the Lord
        unites with Himself; through loving devotional worship, fear is
        dispelled.  || 10 ||   Some take cleansing baths and give donations
        to charities, but they do not understand. Some struggle with their
        minds, and conquer and subdue their minds. Some are imbued with
        love for the True Word of the Shabad; they merge with the True
        Shabad.  || 11 ||   He Himself creates and bestows glorious greatness.
        By the Pleasure of His Will, He bestows union. Bestowing His Grace,
        He comes to dwell in the mind; such is the Command ordained by
        my God.  || 12 ||   Those humble beings who serve the True Guru
        are true. The false, self-willed manmukhs do not know how to serve
        the Guru. The Creator Himself creates the creation and watches
        over it; he attaches all according to the Pleasure of His Will.
        || 13 ||   In each and every age, the True Lord is the one and
        only Giver. Through perfect destiny, one realizes the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad. Those who are immersed in the Shabad
        are not separated again. By His Grace, they are intuitively immersed
        in the Lord.  || 14 ||   Acting in egotism, they are stained with
        the filth of Maya. They die and die again, only to be reborn in
        the love of duality. Without serving the True Guru, no one finds
        liberation. O mind, tune into this, and see.  || 15 || <br>

      <p> He does whatever He pleases. No one has done, or can do anything
        by himself. O Nanak, through the Name, one is blessed with glorious
        greatness, and obtains honor in the Court of the True Lord.  ||
        16 || 3 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  All who come shall have to depart.
        In the love of duality, they are caught by the noose of the Messenger
        of Death. Those humble beings who are protected by the True Guru,
        are saved. They merge into the Truest of the True.  || 1 ||  
        The Creator Himself creates the creation, and watches over it.
        Thay alone are acceptable, upon whom He bestows His Glance of
        Grace. The Gurmukh attains spiritual wisdom, and understands everything.
        The ignorant ones act blindly.  || 2 ||   The self-willed manmukh
        is cynical; he doesn't understand. He dies and dies again,
        only to be reborn, and loses his life uselessly again. The Gurmukh
        is imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he find peace,
        and is intuitively immersed in the True Lord.  || 3 ||   Chasing
        after worldly affairs, the mind has become corroded and rusty.
        But meeting with the Perfect Guru, it is transmuted into gold
        once again. When the Lord Himself grants forgiveness, then peace
        is obtained; through the Perfect Word of the Shabad, one is united
        with Him.  || 4 ||   The false and evil-minded are the most wicked
        of the wicked. They are the most unworthy of the unworthy. With
        false intellect, and insipid words of mouth, evil-minded, they
        do not obtain the Naam.  || 5 ||   The unworthy soul-bride is
        not pleasing to her Husband Lord. False-minded, her actions are
        false. The foolish person does not know the excellence of her
        Husband Lord. Without the Guru, she does not understand at all.
        || 6 ||   The evil-minded, wicked soul-bride practices wickedness.
        She decorates herself, but her Husband Lord is not pleased. The
        virtuous soul-bride enjoys and ravishes her Husband Lord forever;
        the True Guru unites her in His Union.  || 7 ||   God Himself
        issues the Hukam of His Command, and beholds all. Some are forgiven,
        according to their pre-ordained destiny. Night and day, they are
        imbued with the Naam, and they find the True Lord. He Himself
        unites them in His Union.  || 8 ||   Egotism attaches them to
        the juice of emotional attachment, and makes them run around.
        The Gurmukh is intuitively immersed in the True Love of the Lord.
        He Himself unites, He Himself acts, and beholds. Without the True
        Guru, understanding is not obtained.  || 9 ||   Some contemplate
        the Word of the Shabad; these humble beings remain always awake
        and aware. Some are attached to the love of Maya; these unfortunate
        ones remain asleep. He Himself acts, and inspires all to act;
        no one else can do anything.  || 10 ||   Through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, death is conquered and killed. Keep the
        Name of the Lord enshrined within your heart. Serving the True
        Guru, peace is obtained, and one merges in the Name of the Lord.
        || 11 ||   In the love of duality, the world wanders around insane.
        Immersed in love and attachment to Maya, it suffers in pain. Wearing
        all sorts of religious robes, He is not obtained. Without the
        True Guru, peace is not found.  || 12 ||   Who is to blame, when
        He Himself does everything? As He wills, so is the path we take.
        He Himself is the Merciful Giver of peace; as He wills, so do
        we follow.  || 13 ||   He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself
        is the Enjoyer. He Himself is detached, and He Himself is attached.
        He Himself is immaculate, compassionate, the lover of nectar;
        the Hukam of His Command cannot be erased.  || 14 ||   Those who
        know the One Lord are very fortunate. <br>

      <p> He dwells in each and every heart, the Great Giver, the Life of
        the world. At the same time, He is both hidden and revealed. For
        the Gurmukh, doubt and fear are dispelled.  || 15 ||   The Gurmukh
        knows the One, the Dear Lord. Deep within the nucleus of his inner
        being, is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he realizes the Word
        of the Shabad. He alone receives it, unto whom You give it. O
        Nanak, the Naam is glorious greatness.  || 16 || 4 ||   MARU,
        THIRD MEHL:  I praise the true, profound and unfathomable Lord.
        All the world is in His power. He enjoys all hearts forever, day
        and night; He Himself dwells in peace.  || 1 ||   True is the
        Lord and Master, and True is His Name. By Guru's Grace,
        I enshrine Him in my mind. He Himself has come to dwell deep within
        the nucleus of my heart; the noose of death has been snapped.
        || 2 ||   Whom should I serve, and whom should I praise? I serve
        the True Guru, and praise the Word of the Shabad. Through the
        True Shabad, the intellect is exalted and ennobled forever, and
        the lotus deep within blossoms forth.  || 3 ||   The body is frail
        and perishable, like paper. When the drop of water falls upon
        it, it crumbles and dissolves instantaneously. But the body of
        the Gurmukh, who understands, is like gold; the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, dwells deep within.  || 4 ||   Pure is that kitchen,
        which is enclosed by spiritual awareness. The Lord's Name
        is my food, and Truth is my support. Forever satisfied, sanctified
        and pure is that person, within whose heart the Lord's
        Name abides.  || 5 ||   I am a sacrifice to those who are attached
        to the Truth. They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and
        remain awake and aware night and day. True peace fills them forever,
        and their tongues savor the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 6
        ||   I remember the Lord's Name, and no other at all. I
        serve the One Lord, and no other at all. The Perfect Guru has
        revealed the whole Truth to me; I dwell in the True Name.  ||
        7 ||   Wandering, wandering in reincarnation, again and again,
        he comes into the world. He is deluded and confused, when the
        Lord and Master confuses him. He meets with the Dear Lord, when,
        as Gurmukh, he understands; he remembers the Shabad, the Word
        of the immortal, eternal Lord God.  || 8 ||   I am a sinner, overflowing
        with sexual desire and anger. With what mouth should I speak?
        I have no virtue, and I have rendered no service. I am a sinking
        stone; please, Lord, unite me with Yourself. Your Name is eternal
        and imperishable.  || 9 ||   No one does anything; no one is able
        to do anything. That alone happens, which the Lord Himself does,
        and causes to be done. Those whom He Himself forgives, find peace;
        they dwell forever in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 10 ||
        This body is the earth, and the infinite Shabad is the seed.
        Deal and trade with the True Name alone. The True wealth increases;
        it is never exhausted, when the Naam dwells deep within.  || 11
        ||   O Dear Lord, please bless me, the worthless sinner, with
        virtue. Forgive me, and bless me with Your Name. One who becomes
        Gurmukh, is honored; he dwells in the Name of the One Lord alone.
        || 12 ||   The wealth of the Lord is deep within one's
        inner being, but he does not realize it. By Guru's Grace,
        one comes to understand. One who becomes Gurmukh is blessed with
        this wealth; he lives forever in the Naam.  || 13 ||   Fire and
        wind lead him into delusions of doubt. <br>

      <p> In love and attachment to Maya, he has no understanding at all.
        The blind, self-willed manmukh sees nothing; through the Guru's
        Teachings, the Naam is gloriously revealed.  || 14 ||   The manmukhs
        are asleep in egotism and Maya. They do not watch over their own
        homes, and are ruined in the end. They slander others, and burn
        in great anxiety; they dwell in pain and suffering.  || 15 ||
        The Creator Himself has created the creation. He blesses the
        Gurmukh with understanding. O Nanak, those who are attuned to
        the Naam - their minds become immaculate; they dwell in
        the Naam, and only the Naam.  || 16 || 5 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:
        I serve the One Lord, who is eternal, stable and True. Attached
        to duality, the whole world is false. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, I praise the True Lord forever, pleased with the Truest
        of the True.  || 1 ||   Your Glorious Virtues are so many, Lord;
        I do not know even one. The Life of the world, the Great Giver,
        attaches us to himself. He Himself forgives, and bestows glorious
        greatness. Following the Guru's Teachings, this mind is
        delighted.  || 2 ||   The Word of the Shabad has subdued the waves
        of Maya. Egotism has been conquered, and this mind has become
        immaculate. I intuitively sing His Glorious Praises, imbued with
        the Lord's Love. My tongue chants and savors the Lord's
        Name.  || 3 ||   Crying out, &quot;Mine, mine!&quot; he spends
        his life. The self-willed manmukh does not understand; he wanders
        around in ignorance. The Messenger of Death watches over him every
        moment, every instant; night and day, his life is wasting away.
        || 4 ||   He practices greed within, and does not understand.
        He does not see the Messenger of Death hovering over his head.
        Whatever one does in this world, will come to face him in the
        hereafter; what can he do at that very last moment?  || 5 || 
        Those who are attached to the Truth are true. The self-willed
        manmukhs, attached to duality, weep and wail. He is the Lord and
        Master of both worlds; He Himself delights in virtue.  || 6 ||
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, His humble servant
        is exalted forever. This mind is enticed by the Naam, the source
        of nectar. It is not stained at all by the dirt of attachment
        to Maya; through the Guru's Teachings, it is pleased and
        saturated with the Lord's Name.  || 7 ||   The One Lord
        is contained within all. By Guru's Grace, He is revealed.
        One who subdues his ego, finds lasting peace; he drinks in the
        Ambrosial Nectar of the True Name.  || 8 ||   God is the Destroyer
        of sin and pain. The Gurmukh serves Him, and contemplates the
        Word of the Shabad. He Himself is pervading everything. The Gurmukh's
        body and mind are saturated and pleased.  || 9 ||   The world
        is burning in the fire of Maya. The Gurmukh extinguishes this
        fire, by contemplating the Shabad. Deep within are peace and tranquility,
        and lasting peace is obtained. Following the Guru's Teachings,
        one is blessed with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 10 ||
        Even Indra, seated upon his throne, is caught in the fear of
        death. The Messenger of Death will not spare them, even though
        they try all sorts of things. When one meets with the True Guru,
        one is liberated, drinking in and savoring the sublime essence
        of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 11 ||   There is no devotion within
        the self-willed manmukh. Through devotional worship, the Gurmukh
        obtains peace and tranquility. Forever pure and sanctified is
        the Word of the Guru's Bani; following the Guru's
        Teachings, one's inner being is drenched in it.  || 12
        ||   I have considered Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. <br>

      <p> They are bound by the three qualities - the three gunas;
        they are far away from liberation. The Gurmukh knows the spiritual
        wisdom of the One Lord. Night and day, he chants the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord.  || 13 ||   He may read the Vedas, but he does
        not realize the Lord's Name. For the sake of Maya, he reads
        and recites and argues. The ignorant and blind person is filled
        with filth within. How can he cross over the impassable world-ocean?
        || 14 ||   He voices all the controversies of the Vedas, but
        his inner being is not saturated or satisfied, and he does not
        realize the Word of the Shabad. The Vedas tell all about virtue
        and vice, but only the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.
        || 15 ||   The One True Lord is all by Himself. There is no one
        else except Him. O Nanak, true is the mind of one who is attuned
        to the Naam; he speaks Truth, and nothing but Truth.  || 16 ||
        6 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  The True Lord has established the Throne
        of Truth. He dwells in His own home deep within the self, where
        there is no emotional attachment to Maya. The True Lord dwells
        deep within the nucleus of the Gurmukh's heart forever;
        his actions are excellent. || 1 ||   True is his merchandise,
        and true is his trade. There is no doubt within him, and no expanse
        of duality. He has earned the true wealth, which is never exhausted.
        How few are those who contemplate this, and understand.  || 2
        ||   They alone are attached to the True Name, whom the Lord Himself
        attaches. The Word of the Shabad is deep within the nucleus of
        the self; good fortune is recorded upon their foreheads. Through
        the True Word of the Shabad, they sing the True Praises of the
        Lord; they are attuned to contemplative meditation on the Shabad.
        || 3 ||   I praise the True Lord, the Truest of the True. I see
        the One Lord, and no other. The Guru's Teachings are the
        ladder to reach the highest of the high. the jewel of spiritual
        wisdom conquers egotism.  || 4 ||   Emotional attachment to Maya
        is burnt away by the Word of the Shabad. The True One comes to
        dwell in the mind, when it pleases You, O Lord. True are all the
        actions of the truthful; the thirst of egotism is subdued.  ||
        5 ||   All by Himself, God created emotional attachment to Maya.
        How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize the Lord. One who
        becomes Gurmukh practices Truth; true and excellent are his actions.
        || 6 ||   He does those deeds which are pleasing to my God; through
        the Shabad, he burns away egotism and the thirst of desire. Following
        the Guru's Teachings, he remains forever cool and calm
        deep within; he conquers and subdues his ego.  || 7 ||   Those
        who are attached to the Truth are pleased with everything. They
        are embellished with the True Word of the Shabad. Those who are
        true in this world, are true in the Court of the Lord. The Merciful
        Lord adorns them with His Mercy.  || 8 ||   Those who are attached
        to duality, and not the Truth, are trapped in emotional attachment
        to Maya; they totally suffer in pain. Without the Guru, they do
        not understand pain and pleasure; attached to Maya, they suffer
        in terrible pain.  || 9 ||   Those whose minds are pleased with
        the True Word of the Shabad act according to pre-ordained destiny.
        They serve the True Lord, and meditate on the True Lord; they
        are imbued with contemplative meditation on the True Lord.  ||
        10 ||   Service to the Guru seems sweet to them. Night and day,
        they are intuitively immersed in celestial peace. Chanting the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, their minds become immaculate; they
        love to serve the Guru.  || 11 ||   Those humble beings are at
        peace, whom the True Guru attaches to the Truth. He Himself, in
        His Will, merges them into Himself. Those humble beings, whom
        the True Guru protects, are saved. <br>

      <p> The rest are ruined through emotional attachment to Maya.  ||
        12 ||   The Gurmukh realizes the True Word of the Shabad. He has
        no family, and he has no mother. The One and Only Lord is pervading
        and permeating deep within the nucleus of all. He is the Support
        of all beings.  || 13 ||   Egotism, possessiveness, and the love
        of duality - none of these shall go along with you; such
        is the pre-ordained will of our Lord and Master. Through the True
        Guru, practice Truth, and the True Lord shall take away your pains.
        || 14 ||   If You so bless me, then I shall find lasting peace.
        Through the True Word of the Shabad, I live the Truth. The True
        Lord is within me, and my mind and body have become True. I am
        blessed with the overflowing treasure of devotional worship. 
        || 15 ||   He Himself watches, and issues His Command. He Himself
        inspires us to obey His Will. O Nanak, only those who are attuned
        to the Naam are detached; their minds, bodies and tongues are
        embellished with the Naam.  || 16 || 7 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:
        He Himself created Himself, and came into being. The One Lord
        is pervading in all, remaining hidden. The Lord, the Life of the
        world, takes care of all. Whoever knows his own self, realizes
        God.  || 1 ||   He who created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, links
        each and every being to its tasks. He merges into Himself, whoever
        is pleasing to His Will. The Gurmukh knows the One Lord.  || 2
        ||   The world is coming and going in reincarnation. Attached
        to Maya, it dwells on its many sins. One who realizes the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, praises forever the eternal, unchanging
        True Lord.  || 3 ||   Some are attached to the root - they
        find peace. But those who are attached to the branches, waste
        their lives away uselessly. Those humble beings, who chant the
        Name of the Ambrosial Lord, produce the ambrosial fruit.  || 4
        ||   I have no virtues; what words should I speak? You see all,
        and weigh them on Your scale. By Your will, You preserve me, and
        so do I remain. The Gurmukh knows the One Lord.  || 5 ||   According
        to Your Will, You link me to my true tasks. Renouncing vice, I
        am immersed in virtue. The One Immaculate True Lord abides in
        virtue; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized.
        || 6 ||   Wherever I look, there I see Him. Duality and evil-mindedness
        are destroyed through the Shabad. The One Lord God is immersed
        in His Oneness. He is attuned forever to His own delight.  ||
        7 ||   The body-lotus is withering away, but the ignorant, self-willed
        manmukh does not understand the Shabad. By Guru's Grace,
        he searches his body, and finds the Great Giver, the Life of the
        world.  || 8 ||   The Lord frees up the body-fortress, which was
        seized by sins, when one keeps the Dear Lord enshrined forever
        in the heart. The fruits of his desires are obtained, and he is
        dyed in the permanent color of the Lord's Love.  || 9 ||
        The self-willed manmukh speaks of spiritual wisdom, but does
        not understand. Again and again, he comes into the world, but
        he finds no place of rest. The Gurmukh is spiritually wise, and
        praises the Lord forever. Throughout each and every age, the Gurmukh
        knows the One Lord.  || 10 ||   All the deeds which the manmukh
        does bring pain - nothing but pain. The Word of the Shabad
        is not within him; how can he go to the Court of the Lord? The
        True Shabad dwells deep within the mind of the Gurmukh; he serves
        the Giver of peace forever. <br>

      <p> || 11 ||   Wherever I look, I see You, everywhere. Through the
        Perfect Guru, all this is known. I meditate forever and ever on
        the Naam; this mind is imbued with the Naam.  || 12 ||   Imbued
        with the Naam, the body is sanctified. Without the Naam, they
        are drowned and die without water. They come and go, but do not
        understand the Naam. Some, as Gurmukh, realize the Word of the
        Shabad.  || 13 ||   The Perfect True Guru has imparted this understanding.
        Without the Name, no one attains liberation. Through the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, one is blessed with glorious greatness;
        he remains intuitively attuned to the Lord's Love.  ||
        14 ||   The body-village crumbles and collapses into a pile of
        dust. Without the Shabad, the cycle of reincarnation is not brought
        to an end. One who knows the One Lord, through the True Guru,
        praises the True Lord, and remains immersed in the True Lord.
        || 15 ||   The True Word of the Shabad comes to dwell in the
        mind, when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace. O Nanak, those
        who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord, realize
        the True Lord in His True Court.  || 16 || 8 ||   MARU,  SOLHAY,
        THIRD MEHL:  O Creator, it is You Yourself who does all. All
        beings and creatures are under Your Protection. You are hidden,
        and yet permeating within all; through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, You are realized.  || 1 ||   Devotion to the Lord is a
        treasure overflowing. He Himself blesses us with contemplative
        meditation on the Shabad. You do whatever You please; my mind
        is attuned to the True Lord.  || 2 ||   You Yourself are the priceless
        diamond and jewel. In Your Mercy, You weigh with Your scale. All
        beings and creatures are under Your protection. One who is blessed
        by Your Grace realizes his own self.  || 3 ||   One who receives
        Your Mercy, O Primal Lord, does not die, and is not reborn; he
        is released from the cycle of reincarnation. He sings the Glorious
        Praises of the True Lord, day and night, and, throughout the ages,
        he knows the One Lord.  || 4 ||   Emotional attachment to Maya
        wells up throughout the whole world, from Brahma, Vishnu and all
        the demi-gods. Those who are pleasing to Your Will, are attached
        to the Naam; through spiritual wisdom and understanding, You are
        recognized.  || 5 ||   The world is engrossed in vice and virtue.
        Happiness and misery are totally loaded with pain. One who becomes
        Gurmukh finds peace; such a Gurmukh recognizes the Naam.  || 6
        ||   No one can erase the record of one's actions. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one finds the door of salvation.
        One who conquers self-conceit and recognizes the Lord, obtains
        the fruits of his pre-destined rewards.  || 7 ||   Emotionally
        attached to Maya, one's consciousness is not attached to
        the Lord. In the love of duality, he will suffer terrible agony
        in the world hereafter. The hypocritical, self-willed manmukhs
        are deluded by doubt; at the very last moment, they regret and
        repent.  || 8 ||   In accordance with the Lord's Will,
        he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. He is rid of all sinful
        residues, and all suffering. The Lord is immaculate, and immaculate
        is the Word of His Bani. My mind is imbued with the Lord.  ||
        9 ||   One who is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace,
        obtains the Lord, the treasure of virtue. Egotism and possessiveness
        are brought to an end. The One Lord is the only Giver of virtue
        and vice, merits and demerits; how rare are those who, as Gurmukh,
        understand this.  || 10 ||   My God is immaculate, and utterly
        infinite. God unites with Himself, through contemplation of the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad. <br>

      <p> He Himself forgives, and implants the Truth. The mind and body
        are then attuned to the True Lord.  || 11 ||   Within the polluted
        mind and body is the Light of the Infinite Lord. One who understands
        the Guru's Teachings, contemplates this. Conquering egotism,
        the mind becomes immaculate forever; with his tongue, he serves
        the Lord, the Giver of peace.  || 12 ||   In the fortress of the
        body there are many shops and bazaars; within them is the Naam,
        the Name of the utterly infinite Lord. In His Court, one is embellished
        forever with the Word of the Guru's Shabad; he conquers
        egotism and realizes the Lord.  || 13 ||   The jewel is priceless,
        inaccessible and infinite. How can the poor wretch estimate its
        worth? Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is weighed,
        and so the Shabad is realized deep within.  || 14 ||   The great
        volumes of the Simritees and the Shaastras only extend the extension
        of attachment to Maya. The fools read them, but do not understand
        the Word of the Shabad. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand.
        || 15 ||   The Creator Himself acts, and causes all to act. Through
        the True Word of His Bani, Truth is implanted deep within. O Nanak,
        through the Naam, one is blessed with glorious greatness, and
        throughout the ages, the One Lord is known.  || 16 || 9 ||   MARU,
        THIRD MEHL:  Serve the True Creator Lord. The Word of the Shabad
        is the Destroyer of pain. He is inaccessible and unfathomable;
        He cannot be evaluated. He Himself is inaccessible and immeasurable.
        || 1 ||   The True Lord Himself makes Truth pervasive. He attaches
        some humble beings to the Truth. They serve the True Lord and
        practice Truth; through the Name, they are absorbed in the True
        Lord.  || 2 ||   The Primal Lord unites His devotees in His Union.
        He attaches them to true devotional worship. One who sings forever
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, through the True Word of His
        Bani, earns the profit of this life.  || 3 ||   The Gurmukh trades,
        and understands his own self. He knows no other than the One Lord.
        True is the banker, and True are His traders, who buy the merchandise
        of the Naam.  || 4 ||   He Himself fashions and creates the Universe.
        He inspires a few to realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        Those humble beings who serve the True Guru are true. He snaps
        the noose of death from around their necks.  || 5 ||   He destroys,
        creates, embellishes and fashions all beings, and attaches them
        to duality, attachment and Maya. The self-willed manmukhs wander
        around forever, acting blindly. Death has strung his noose around
        their necks.  || 6 ||   He Himself forgives, and enjoins us to
        serve the Guru. Through the Guru's Teachings, the Naam
        comes to dwell within the mind. Night and day, meditate on the
        Naam, the Name of the True Lord, and earn the profit of the Naam
        in this world.  || 7 ||   He Himself is True, and True is His
        Name. The Gurmukh bestows it, and enshrines it within the mind.
        Noble and exalted are those, within whose mind the Lord abides.
        Their heads are free of strife.  || 8 ||   He is inaccessible
        and unfathomable; His value cannot be appraised. By Guru's
        Grace, He dwells within the mind. No one calls that person to
        account, who praises the Word of the Shabad, the Giver of virtue.
        || 9 ||   Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva serve Him. Even they cannot
        find the limits of the unseen, unknowable Lord. Those who are
        blessed by Your Glance of Grace, become Gurmukh, and comprehend
        the incomprehensible. <br>

        I have enshrined the Naam, the One Name, within my mind. I chant
        the Naam, and meditate on the Naam. Singing His Glorious Praises,
        I enter the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.  || 11 || 
        The servant serves, and obeys the Command of the Infinite Lord.
        The self-willed manmukhs do not know the value of the Lord's
        Command. By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, one is exalted;
        by His Hukam, one is glorified; by His Hukam, one becomes carefree.
        || 12 ||   By Guru's Grace, one recognizes the Lord's
        Hukam. The wandering mind is restrained, and brought back to the
        home of the One Lord. Imbued with the Naam, one remains forever
        detached; the jewel of the Naam rests within the mind.  || 13
        ||   The One Lord is pervasive throughout all the world. By Guru's
        Grace, He is revealed. Those humble beings who praise the Shabad
        are immaculate; they dwell within the home of their own inner
        self.  || 14 ||   The devotees abide forever in Your Sanctuary,
        Lord. You are inaccessible and unfathomable; Your value cannot
        be estimated. As it pleases Your Will, You keep us; the Gurmukh
        meditates on the Naam.  || 15 ||   Forever and ever, I sing Your
        Glorious Praises. O my True Lord and Master, may I become pleasing
        to Your Mind. Nanak offers this true prayer: O Lord, please bless
        me with Truth, that I may merge in the Truth.  || 16 || 1 || 10
        ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who serve the True Guru are very
        fortunate. Night and day, they remain lovingly attuned to the
        True Name. The Lord, the Giver of peace, abides forever deep within
        their hearts; they delight in the True Word of the Shabad.  ||
        1 ||   When the Lord grants His Grace, one meets with the Guru.
        The Name of the Lord is enshrined within the mind. The Lord, the
        Giver of peace, abides forever within the mind; the mind is delighted
        with the Word of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   When the Lord bestows
        His Mercy, He unites in His Union. Egotism and attachment are
        burned away by the Shabad. In the Love of the One Lord, one remains
        liberated forever; he is not in conflict with anyone.  || 3 ||
        Without serving the True Guru, there is only pitch-black darkness.
        Without the Shabad, no one crosses over to the other side. Those
        who are imbued with the Shabad, are very detached. They earn the
        profit of the True Word of the Shabad.  || 4 ||   Pain and pleasure
        are pre-ordained by the Creator. He Himself has caused the love
        of duality to be pervasive. One who becomes Gurmukh remains detached;
        how can anyone trust the self-willed manmukh?  || 5 ||   Those
        who do not recognize the Shabad are manmukhs. They do not know
        the essence of the Fear of the Guru. Without this Fear, how can
        anyone find the Fearless True Lord? The Messenger of Death will
        pull the breath out.  || 6 ||   The invulnerable Messenger of
        Death cannot be killed. The Word of the Guru's Shabad prevents
        him from approaching. When he hears the Word of the Shabad, he
        runs far away. He is afraid that the self-sufficient Dear Lord
        will kill him.  || 7 ||   The Dear Lord is the Ruler above all.
        What can this wretched Messenger of Death do? As slave to the
        Hukam of the Lord's Command, the mortal acts according
        to His Hukam. According to His Hukam, he is deprived of his breath.
        || 8 ||   The Gurmukh realizes that the True Lord created the
        creation. The Gurmukh knows that the Lord has expanded the entire
        expanse. One who becomes Gurmukh, understands the True Lord. Through
        the True Word of the Shabad, he finds peace.  || 9 ||   The Gurmukh
        knows that the Lord is the Architect of karma. <br>
