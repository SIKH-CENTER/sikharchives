      <p> Throughout the four ages, he recognizes the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. The Gurmukh does not die, the Gurmukh is not reborn; the
        Gurmukh is immersed in the Shabad.  || 10 ||   The Gurmukh praises
        the Naam, and the Shabad. God is inaccessible, unfathomable and
        self-sufficient. The Naam, the Name of the One Lord, saves and
        redeems throughout the four ages. Through the Shabad, one trades
        in the Naam.  || 11 ||   The Gurmukh obtains eternal peace and
        tranqulity. The Gurmukh enshrines the Naam within his heart. One
        who becomes Gurmukh recognizes the Naam, and the noose of evil-mindedness
        is snapped.  || 12 ||   The Gurmukh wells up from, and then merges
        back into Truth. He does not die and take birth, and is not consigned
        to reincarnation. The Gurmukh remains forever imbued with the
        color of the Lord's Love. Night and day, he earns a profit.
        || 13 ||   The Gurmukhs, the devotees, are exalted and beautified
        in the Court of the Lord. They are embellished with the True Word
        of His Bani, and the Word of the Shabad. Night and day, they sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, day and night, and they intuitively
        go to their own home.  || 14 ||   The Perfect True Guru proclaims
        the Shabad; night and day, remain lovingly attuned to devotional
        worship. One who sings forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        becomes immaculate; Immaculate are the Glorious Praises of the
        Sovereign Lord .  || 15 ||   The True Lord is the Giver of virtue.
        How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand this. Servant Nanak
        praises the Naam; he blossoms forth in the ecstasy of the Name
        of the self-sufficient Lord.  || 16 || 2 || 11 ||   MARU,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Serve the Dear Lord, the inaccessible and infinite. He
        has no end or limitation. By Guru's Grace, one who dwells
        upon the Lord deep within his heart -  his heart is filled
        with infinite wisdom.  || 1 ||   The One Lord is pervading and
        permeating amidst all. By Guru's Grace, He is revealed.
        The Life of the world nurtures and cherishes all, giving sustenance
        to all.  || 2 ||   The Perfect True Guru has imparted this understanding.
        By the Hukam of His Command, He created the entire Universe. Whoever
        submits to His Command, finds peace; His Command is above the
        heads of kings and emperors.  || 3 ||   True is the True Guru.
        Infinite is the Word of His Shabad. Through His Shabad, the world
        is saved. The Creator Himself created the creation; He gazes upon
        it, and blesses it with breath and nourishment.  || 4 ||   Out
        of millions, only a few understand. Imbued with the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, they are colored in His Love. They praise
        the Lord, the Giver of peace forever; the Lord forgives His devotees,
        and blesses them with His Praise.  || 5 ||   Those humble beings
        who serve the True Guru are true. The falsest of the false die,
        only to be reborn. The inaccessible, unfathomable, self-sufficient,
        incomprehensible Lord is the Lover of His devotees.  || 6 || 
        The Perfect True Guru implants Truth within. Through the True
        Word of the Shabad, they sing His Glorious Praises forever. The
        Giver of virtue is pervading deep within the nucleus of all beings;
        He inscribes the time of destiny upon each and every person's
        head.  || 7 ||   The Gurmukh knows that God is always ever-present.
        That humble being who serves the Shabad, is comforted and fulfilled.
        Night and day, he serves the True Word of the Guru's Bani;
        he delights in the True Word of the Shabad.  || 8 ||   The ignorant
        and blind cling to all sorts of rituals. They stubborn-mindedly
        perform these rituals, and are consigned to reincarnation. <br>

      <p> For the sake of poison, they act in greed and possessiveness,
        and evil-minded duality.  || 9 ||   The Perfect True Guru implants
        devotional worship within. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, he lovingly centers his consciousness on the Lord's
        Name. The Lord pervades his mind, body and heart; deep within,
        his mind is drenched with devotional worship and praise of the
        Lord.  || 10 ||   My True Lord God is the Destroyer of demons.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, His devotees are
        saved. My True Lord God is forever True. He is the Emperor over
        the heads of kings.  || 11 ||   True are those devotees, who are
        pleasing to Your Mind. They sing the Kirtan of His Praises at
        His Door; they are embellished and exalted by the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad. Night and day, they sing the True Word of
        His Bani. The Naam is the wealth of the poor.  || 12 ||   Those
        whom You unite, Lord, are never separated again. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, they praise You forever. You are
        the One Lord and Master over all. Through the Shabad, the Naam
        is praised.  || 13 ||   Without the Shabad, no one knows You.
        You Yourself speak the Unspoken Speech. You Yourself are the Shabad
        forever, the Guru, the Great Giver; chanting the Lord's
        Name, You bestow Your treasure.  || 14 ||   You Yourself are the
        Creator of the Universe. No one can erase what You have written.
        You Yourself bless the Gurmukh with the Naam, who is no longer
        skeptical, and is not held to account.  || 15 ||   Your true devotees
        stand at the Door of Your Court. They serve the Shabad with love
        and affection. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam remain
        detached; through the Naam, their affairs are resolved.  || 16
        || 3 || 12 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  My True Lord God has staged
        a play. He has created no one like anyone else. He made them different,
        and he gazes upon them with pleasure; he placed all the flavors
        in the body.  || 1 ||   You Yourself vibrate the beat of the breath.
        Shiva and Shakti, energy and matter - You have placed them
        into the body. By Guru's Grace, one turns away from the
        world, and attains the jewel of spiritual wisdom, and the Word
        of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   He Himself created darkness and light.
        He alone is pervasive; there is no other at all. One who realizes
        his own self - by Guru's Grace, the lotus of his
        mind blossoms forth.  || 3 ||   Only He Himself knows His depth
        and extent. Other people can only listen and hear what is spoken
        and said. One who is spiritually wise, understands himself as
        Gurmukh; he praises the True Lord.  || 4 ||   Deep within the
        body is the priceless object. He Himself opens the doors. The
        Gurmukh intuitively drings in the Ambrosial Nectar, and the fire
        of desire is quenched.  || 5 ||   He placed all the flavors within
        the body. How rare are those who understand, through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad. So search within yourself, and praise
        the Shabad. Why run around outside your self?  || 6 ||   Without
        tasting, no one enjoys the flavor. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, one drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. The Ambrosial Nectar
        is drunk, and the immoral status is obtained, when one obtains
        the sublime essence of the Guru's Shabad.  || 7 ||   One
        who realizes himself, knows all virtues. <br>

      <p> Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he chants the Name
        of the Lord. Night and day, he remains imbued with the Naam, day
        and night; he is rid of emotional attachment to Maya.  || 8 ||
        Serving the Guru, all things are obtained; egotism, possessiveness
        and self-conceit are taken away. The Lord, the Giver of peace
        Himself grants His Grace; He exalts and adorns with the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad.  || 9 ||   The Guru's Shabad
        is the Ambrosial Bani. Night and day, chant the Name of the Lord.
        That heart becomes immaculate, which is filled with the True Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 10 ||   His servants serve, and praise His Shabad.
        Imbued forever with the color of His Love, they sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord. He Himself forgives, and unites them with
        the Shabad; the fragrance of sandalwood permeates their minds.
        || 11 ||   Through the Shabad, they speak the Unspoken, and praise
        the Lord. My True Lord God is self-sufficient. The Giver of virtue
        Himself unites them with the Shabad; they enjoy the sublime essence
        of the Shabad.  || 12 ||   The confused, self-willed manmukhs
        find no place of rest. They do those deeds which they are pre-destined
        to do. Imbued with poison, they search out poison, and suffer
        the pains of death and rebirth.  || 13 ||   He Himself praises
        Himself. Your Glorious Virtues are within You alone, God. You
        Yourself are True, and True is the Word of Your Bani. You Yourself
        are invisible and unknowable.  || 14 ||   Without the Guru, the
        Giver, no one finds the Lord, though one may make hundreds of
        thousands and millions of attempts. By Guru's Grace, He
        dwells deep within the heart; through the Shabad, praise the True
        Lord.  || 15 ||   They alone meet Him, whom the Lord unites with
        Himself. They are adorned and exalted with the True Word of His
        Bani, and the Shabad. Servant Nanak continually sings the Glorious
        Praises of the True Lord; singing His Glories, he is immersed
        in the Glorious Lord of Virtue.  || 16 || 4 || 13 ||   MARU, 
        THIRD MEHL:  The One Lord is eternal and unchanging, forever True.
        Through the Perfect Guru, this understanding is obtained. Those
        who are drenched with the sublime essence of the Lord, meditate
        forever on Him; following the Guru's Teachings, they obtain
        the armor of humility.  || 1 ||   Deep within, they love the True
        Lord forever. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they
        love the Lord's Name. The Naam, the embodiment of the nine
        treasures, abides within their hearts; they renounce the profit
        of Maya.  || 2 ||   Both the king and his subjects are involved
        in evil-mindedness and duality. Without serving the True Guru,
        they do not become one with the Lord. Those who meditate on the
        One Lord find eternal peace. Their power is eternal and unfailing.
        || 3 ||   No one can save them from coming and going. Birth and
        death come from Him. The Gurmukh meditates forever on the True
        Lord. Emancipation and liberation are obtained from Him.  || 4
        ||   Truth and self-control are found through the Door of the
        True Guru. Egotism and anger are silenced through the Shabad.
        Serving the True Guru, lasting peace is found; humility and contentment
        all come from Him.  || 5 ||   Out of egotism and attachment, the
        Universe welled up. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        all the world perishes. Without serving the True Guru, the Naam
        is not obtained. The Naam is the True profit in this world.  ||
        6 ||   True is His Will, beauteous and pleasing through the Word
        of the Shabad. The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, vibrate
        and resonate. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Through the True Name, one's actions are forever embellished.
        Without the Shabad, what can anyone do?  || 7 ||   One instant,
        he laughs, and the next instant, he cries. Because of duality
        and evil-mindedness, his affairs are not resolved. Union and separation
        are pre-ordained by the Creator. Actions already committed cannot
        be taken back.  || 8 ||   One who lives the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad becomes Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive.
        He remains forever immersed in the Lord. By Guru's Grace,
        one is blessed with glorious greatness; he is not afflicted by
        the disease of egotism.  || 9 ||   Eating tasty delicacies, he
        fattens up his body and wears religious robes, but he does not
        live to the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Deep with the nucleus
        of his being is the great disease; he suffers terrible pain, and
        eventually sinks into the manure.  || 10 ||   He reads and studies
        the Vedas, and argues about them; God is within his own heart,
        but he does not recognize the Word of the Shabad. One who becomes
        Gurmukh churns the essence of reality; his tongue savors the sublime
        essence of the Lord.  || 11 ||   Those who forsake the object
        within their own hearts, wander outside. The blind, self-willed
        manmukhs do not taste the flavor of God. Imbued with the taste
        of another, their tongues speak tasteless, insipid words. They
        never taste the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 12 ||   The self-willed
        manmukh has doubt as his spouse. He dies of evil-mindedness, and
        suffers forever. His mind is attached to sexual desire, anger
        and duality, and he does not find peace, even in dreams.  || 13
        ||   The body becomes golden, with the Word of the Shabad as its
        spouse. Night and day, enjoy the enjoyments, and be in love with
        the Lord. Deep within the mansion of the self, one finds the Lord,
        who transcends this mansion. Realizing His Will, we merge in Him.
        || 14 ||   The Great Giver Himself gives. No one has any power
        to stand against Him. He Himself forgives, and unites us with
        the Shabad; The Word of His Shabad is unfathomable.  || 15 ||
        Body and soul, all belong to Him. The True Lord is my only Lord
        and Master. O Nanak, through the Word of the Guru's Bani,
        I have found the Lord. Chanting the Lord's Chant, I merge
        in Him.  || 16 || 5 || 14 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukh
        contemplates the sound current of the Naad instead of the Vedas.
        The Gurmukh attains infinite spiritual wisdom and meditation.
        The Gurmukh acts in harmony with God's Will; the Gurmukh
        finds perfection.  || 1 ||   The mind of the Gurmukh turns away
        from the world. The Gurmukh vibrates the Naad, the sound current
        of the Guru's Bani. The Gurmukh, attuned to the Truth,
        remains detached, and dwells in the home of the self deep within.
        || 2 ||   I speak the Ambrosial Teachings of the Guru. I lovingly
        chant the Truth, through the True Word of the Shabad. My mind
        remains forever imbued with the Love of the True Lord. I am immersed
        in the Truest of the True.  || 3 ||   Immaculate and pure is the
        mind of the Gurmukh, who bathes in the Pool of Truth. No filth
        attaches to him; he merges in the True Lord. He truly practices
        Truth forever; true devotion is implanted within him.  || 4 ||
        True is the speech of the Gurmukh; true are the eyes of the
        Gurmukh. The Gurmukh practices and lives the Truth. He speaks
        the Truth forever, day and night, and inspires others to speak
        the Truth.  || 5 ||   True and exalted is the speech of the Gurmukh.
        The Gurmukh speaks Truth, only Truth. <br>

      <p> The Gurmukh serves the Truest of the True forever; the Gurmukh
        proclaims the Word of the Shabad.  || 6 ||   One who becomes Gurmukh
        understands. He rids himself of egotism, Maya and doubt. He ascends
        the sublime, exalted ladder of the Guru, and he sings the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord at His True Door.  || 7 ||   The Gurmukh practices
        true self-control, and acts in excellence. The Gurmukh obtains
        the gate of salvation. Through loving devotion, he remains forever
        imbued with the Lord's Love; eradicating self-conceit,
        he merges in the Lord.  || 8 ||   One who becomes Gurmukh examines
        his own mind, and instructs others. He is lovingly attuned to
        the True Name forever. They act in harmony with the Mind of the
        True Lord.  || 9 ||   As it pleases His Will, He unites us with
        the True Guru. As it pleases His Will, He comes to dwell within
        the mind. As it pleases His Will, He imbues us with His Love;
        as it pleases His Will, He comes to dwell in the mind.  || 10
        ||   Those who act stubborn-mindedly are destroyed. Wearing all
        sorts of religious robes, they do not please the Lord. Tinged
        by corruption, they earn only pain; they are immersed in pain.
        || 11 ||   One who becomes Gurmukh earns peace. He comes to understand
        death and birth. One who looks alike upon death and birth, is
        pleasing to my God.  || 12 ||   The Gurmukh, while remaining dead,
        is respected and approved. He realizes that coming and going are
        according to God's Will. He does not die, he is not reborn,
        and he does not suffer in pain; his mind merges in the Mind of
        God.  || 13 ||   Very fortunate are those who find the True Guru.
        They eradicate egotism and attachment from within. Their minds
        are immaculate, and they are never again stained with filth. They
        are honored at the Door of the True Court.  || 14 ||   He Himself
        acts, and inspires all to act. He Himself watches over all; He
        establishes and disestablishes. The service of the Gurmukh is
        pleasing to my God; one who listens to the Truth is approved.
        || 15 ||   The Gurmukh practices Truth, and only Truth. The Gurmukh
        is immaculate; no filth attaches to him. O Nanak, those who contemplate
        the Naam are imbued with it. They merge in the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 16 || 1 || 15 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  He Himself
        fashioned the Universe, through the Hukam of His Command. He Himself
        establishes and disestablishes, and embellishes with grace. The
        True Lord Himself administers all justice; through Truth, we merge
        in the True Lord.  || 1 ||   The body takes the form of a fortress.
        Emotional attachment to Maya has expanded throughout its expanse.
        Without the Word of the Shabad, the body is reduced to a pile
        of ashes; in the end, dust mingles with dust.  || 2 ||   The body
        is the infinite fortress of gold; it is permeated by the Infinite
        Word of the Shabad. The Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of
        the True Lord forever; meeting his Beloved, he finds peace.  ||
        3 ||   The body is the temple of the Lord; the Lord Himself embellishes
        it. The Dear Lord dwells within it. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, the merchants trade, and in His Grace, the Lord merges
        them with Himself.  || 4 ||   He alone is pure, who eradicates
        anger. He realizes the Shabad, and reforms himself. The Creator
        Himself acts, and inspires all to act; He Himself abides in the
        mind.  || 5 ||   Pure and unique is devotional worship. <br>

      <p> The mind and body are washed clean, contemplating the Shabad.
        One who remains forever imbued with His Love, night and day -
        in His Mercy, the Lord inspires him to perform devotional worship
        service.  || 6 ||   In this temple of the mind, the mind wanders
        around. Discarding joy like straw, it suffers in terrible pain.
        Without meeting the True Guru, it finds no place of rest; He Himself
        has staged this play.  || 7 ||   He Himself is infinite; He contemplates
        Himself. He Himself bestows Union through actions of excellence.
        What can the poor creatures do? Granting forgiveness, He unites
        them with Himself.  || 8 ||   The Perfect Lord Himself unites
        them with the True Guru. Through the True Word of the Shabad,
        he makes them brave spiritual heroes. Uniting them with Himself,
        He bestows glorious greatness; He inspires them to focus their
        consciousness on the True Lord.  || 9 ||   The True Lord is deep
        within the heart. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize
        this. The treasure of the Naam abides deep within their hearts;
        they meditate on the Naam with their tongues.  || 10 ||   He wanders
        through foreign lands, but does not look within himself. Attached
        to Maya, he is bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death. The
        noose of death around his neck will never be untied; in the love
        of duality, he wanders in reincarnation.  || 11 ||   There is
        no real chanting, meditation, penance or self-control, as long
        as one does not live to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        Accepting the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one obtains Truth;
        through Truth, one merges in the True Lord.  || 12 ||   Sexual
        desire and anger are very powerful in the world. They lead to
        all sorts of actions, but these only add to all the pain. Those
        who serve the True Guru find peace; they are united with the True
        Shabad.  || 13 ||   Air, water and fire make up the body. Emotional
        attachment to Maya rules deep within all. When one realizes the
        One who created him, emotional attachment to Maya is dispelled.
        || 14 ||   Some are engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya
        and pride. They are self-conceited and egotistical. They never
        think about the Messenger of Death; in the end, they leave, regretting
        and repenting.  || 15 ||   He alone knows the Way, who created
        it. The Gurmukh, who is blessed with the Shabad, realizes Him.
        Slave Nanak offers ths prayer; O Lord, let my consciousness be
        attached to the True Name.  || 16 || 2 || 16 ||   MARU,  THIRD
        MEHL:  From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages,
        the Merciful Lord has been the Great Giver. Through the Shabad,
        the Word of the Perfect Guru, He is realized. Those who serve
        You are immersed in You. You unite them in Union with Yourself.
        || 1 ||   You are inaccessible and unfathomable; Your limits
        cannot be found. All beings and creatures seek Your Sanctuary.
        As is pleases Your Will, You guide us along; You Yourself place
        us on the Path.  || 2 ||   The True Lord is, and shall always
        be. He Himself creates - there is no other at all. The
        Giver of peace takes care of all; He Himself sustains them.  ||
        3 ||   You are inaccessible, unfathomable, invisible and infinite;
        no one knows Your extent. You Yourself realize Yourself. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, You reveal Yourself.  || 4 || <br>

      <p> Your Almighty Command prevails throughout the nether worlds, realms
        and worlds of form. By the Hukam of Your Command, You create,
        and by Your Command, You destroy. By Your Command, You unite in
        Union.  || 5 ||   One who realizes Your Command, praises Your
        Command. You are Inaccessible, Unfathomable and Self-Sufficient.
        As is the understanding You give, so do I become. You Yourself
        reveal the Shabad.  || 6 ||   Night and day, the days of our lives
        wear away. Night and day both bear witness to this loss. The blind,
        foolish, self-willed manmukh is not aware of this; death is hovering
        over his head.  || 7 ||   The mind and body are cooled and soothed,
        holding tight to the Guru's Feet. Doubt is eliminated from
        within, and fear runs away. One is in bliss forever, singing the
        Glorious Praises of the True Lord, and speaking the True Word
        of His Bani.  || 8 ||   One who knows You as the Architect of
        Karma, has the good fortune of perfect destiny, and recognizes
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The Lord, the Truest of
        the True, is his social class and honor. Conquering his ego, he
        is united with the Lord.  || 9 ||   The stubborn and insensitive
        mind is attached to the love of duality. Deluded by doubt, the
        unfortunate wander around in confusion. But if they are blessed
        by God's Grace, they serve the True Guru, and easily obtain
        peace.  || 10 ||   He Himself created the 8.4 million species
        of beings. Only in this human life, is devotional worship to the
        Guru implanted within. Without devotion, one lives in manure;
        he falls into manure again and again.  || 11 ||   If one is blessed
        with His Grace, devotional worship to the Guru is implanted within.
        Without God's Grace, how can anyone find Him? The Creator
        Himself acts, and inspires all to act; as He wills, he leads us
        on.  || 12 ||   The Simritees and the Shaastras do not know His
        limits. The blind fool does not recognize the essence of reality.
        The Creator Himself acts, and inspires all to act; He Himself
        deludes with doubt.  || 13 ||   He Himself causes everything to
        be done. He Himself joins each and every person to his tasks.
        He Himself establishes and disestablishes, and watches over all;
        He reveals Himself to the Gurmukh.  || 14 ||   The True Lord and
        Master is profoundly deep and unfathomable. Praising Him forever,
        the mind is comforted and consoled. He is inaccessible and unfathomable;
        His value cannot be estimated. He dwells in the mind of the Gurmukh.
        || 15 ||   He Himself is detached; all others are entangled in
        their affairs. By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand
        Him. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell deep
        within the heart; through the Guru's Teachings, one is
        united in His Union.  || 16 || 3 || 17 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:
        For thirty-six ages, utter darkness prevailed. Only You Yourself
        know this, O Creator Lord. What can anyone else say? What can
        anyone explain? Only You Yourself can estimate Your worth.  ||
        1 ||   The One Universal Creator created the entire Universe.
        All the plays and dramas are to Your glory and greatness. The
        True Lord Himself makes all distinctions; He Himself breaks and
        builds.  || 2 ||   The Juggler has staged His juggling show. Through
        the Perfect Guru, one comes to behold it. One who remains forever
        detached in the Word of the Guru's Shabad - his
        consciousness is attuned to the True Lord.  || 3 ||   The musical
        instruments of the body vibrate and resound. The Player Himself
        plays them. The breath flows equally through the hearts of each
        and every being. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Receiving the breath, all the instruments sing.  || 4 ||   Whatever
        the Creator does, surely comes to pass. Through the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, egotism is consumed. By Guru's Grace,
        some are blessed with glorious greatness; they meditate on the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 5 ||   There is no other profit
        as great as service to the Guru. The Naam abides within my mind,
        and I praise the Naam. The Naam is forever the Giver of peace.
        Through the Naam, we earn the profit.  || 6 ||   Without the Name,
        all the world suffers in misery. The more actions one does, the
        more the corruption increases. Without serving the Naam, how can
        anyone find peace? Without the Naam, one suffers in pain.  ||
        7 ||   He Himself acts, and inspires all to act. By Guru's
        Grace, He reveals Himself to a few. One who becomes Gurmukh breaks
        his bonds, and attains the home of liberation.  || 8 ||   One
        who calculates his accounts, burns in the world. His skepticism
        and corruption are never dispelled. One who becomes Gurmukh abandons
        his calculations; through Truth, we merge in the True Lord.  ||
        9 ||   If God grants Truth, then we may attain it. By Guru's
        Grace, it is revealed. One who praises the True Name, and remains
        imbued with the Lord's Love, by Guru's Grace, finds
        peace.  || 10 ||   The Beloved Naam, the Name of the Lord, is
        chanting, meditation, penance and self-control. God, the Destroyer,
        destroys sins. Through the Name of the Lord, the body and mind
        are cooled and soothed, and one is intuitively, easily absorbed
        into the Celestial Lord.  || 11 ||   With greed within them, their
        minds are filthy, and they spread filth around. They do filthy
        deeds, and suffer in pain. They deal in falsehood, and nothing
        but falsehood; telling lies, they suffer in pain.  || 12 ||  
        Rare is that person who enshrines the Immaculate Bani of the Guru's
        Word within his mind. By Guru's Grace, his skepticism is
        removed. He walks in harmony with the Guru's Will, day
        and night; remembering the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds
        peace.  || 13 ||   The True Lord Himself is the Creator. He Himself
        creates and destroys. One who becomes Gurmukh, praises the Lord
        forever. Meeting the True Lord, he finds peace.  || 14 ||   Making
        countless efforts, sexual desire is not overcome. Everyone is
        burning in the fires of sexuality and anger. Serving the True
        Guru, one brings his mind under control; conquering his mind,
        he merges in the Mind of God.  || 15 ||   You Yourself created
        the sense of 'mine' and 'yours.' All creatures
        are Yours; You created all beings. O Nanak, contemplate the Naam
        forever; through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord abides
        in the mind.  || 16 || 4 || 18 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  The Dear
        Lord is the Giver, inaccessible and unfathomable. He does not
        have even an iota of greed; He is self-sufficient. No one can
        reach up to Him; He Himself unites in His Union.  || 1 ||   Whatever
        He does, surely comes to pass. There is no other Giver, except
        for Him. Whoever the Lord blesses with His gift, obtains it. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He unites him with Himself.
        || 2 ||   The fourteen worlds are Your markets. The True Guru
        reveals them, along with one's inner being. <br>

      <p> One who deals in the Name, through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, obtains it.  || 3 ||   Serving the True Guru, one obtains
        intuitive bliss. The Lord of the Universe comes to dwell within
        the heart. He intuitively practices devotional worship day and
        night; God Himself practices devotional worship.  || 4 ||   Those
        who are separated from the True Guru, suffer in misery. Night
        and day, they are punished, and they suffer in total agony. Their
        faces are blackened, and they do not obtain the Mansion of the
        Lord's Presence. They suffer in sorrow and agony.  || 5
        ||   Those who serve the True Guru are very fortunate. They intuitively
        enshrine love for the True Lord. They practice Truth, forever
        Truth; they are united in Union with the True Lord.  || 6 || 
        He alone obtains the Truth, unto whom the True Lord gives it.
        His inner being is filled with Truth, and his doubt is dispelled.
        The True Lord Himself is the Giver of Truth; he alone obtains
        the Truth, unto whom He gives it.  || 7 ||   He Himself is the
        Creator of all. Only one whom He instructs, understands Him. He
        Himself forgives, and grants glorious greatness. He himself unites
        in His Union.  || 8 ||   Acting egotistically, one loses his life.
        Even in the world hereafter, emotioal attachment to Maya does
        not leave him. In the world hereafter, the Messenger of Death
        calls him to account, and crushes him like sesame seeds in the
        oil-press.  || 9 ||   By perfect destiny, one serves the Guru.
        If God grants His Grace, then one serves. The Messenger of Death
        cannot even approach him, and in the Mansion of the True Lord's
        Presence, he finds peace.  || 10 ||   They alone find peace, who
        are pleasing to Your Will. By perfect destiny, they are attached
        to the Guru's service. All glorious greatness rests in
        Your Hands; he alone obtains it, unto whom You give it.  || 11
        ||   Through the Guru, one's inner being is enlightened
        and illumined. The wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes
        to dwell in the mind. The jewel of spiritual wisdom ever illumines
        the heart, and the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled.
        || 12 ||   The blind and ignorant are attached to duality. The
        unfortunates are drowned without water, and die. When they depart
        from the world, they do not find the Lord's door and home;
        bound and gagged at Death's door, they suffer in pain.
        || 13 ||   Without serving the True Guru, no one finds liberation.
        Go ask any spiritual teacher or meditator. Whoever serves the
        True Guru is blessed with glorious greatness, and honored in the
        Court of the True Lord.  || 14 ||   One who serves the True Guru,
        the Lord merges into Himself. Cutting away attachment, one lovingly
        focuses on the True Lord. The merchants deal forever in Truth;
        they earn the profit of the Naam.  || 15 ||   The Creator Himself
        acts, and inspires all to act. He alone is liberated, who dies
        in the Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, the Naam dwells deep within
        the mind; meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 16 ||
        5 || 19 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  Whatever You do, is done. How
        rare are those who walk in harmony with the Lord's Will.
        One who surrenders to the Lord's Will finds peace; he finds
        peace in the Lord's Will.  || 1 ||   Your Will is pleasing
        to the Gurmukh. Practicing Truth, he intuitively finds peace.
        Many long to walk in harmony with the Lord's Will; He Himself
        inspires us to surrender to His Will.  || 2 ||   One who surrenders
        to Your Will, meets with You, Lord. <br>

      <p> One who is pleased with Your Will is immersed in You. Glorious
        greatness rests in God's Will; rare are those who accept
        it.  || 3 ||   When it pleases His Will, He leads us to meet the
        Guru. The Gurmukh finds the treasure of the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord. By Your Will, You created the whole Universe; those
        whom You bless with Your favor are pleased with Your Will.  ||
        4 ||   The blind, self-willed manmukhs practice cleverness. They
        do not surrender to the Lord's Will, and suffer terrible
        pain. Deluded by doubt, they come and go in reincarnation; they
        never find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.  || 5 ||
        The True Guru brings Union, and grants glorious greatness. The
        Primal Lord ordained service to the True Guru. Serving the True
        Guru, the Naam is obtained. Through the Naam, one finds peace.
        || 6 ||   Everything wells up from the Naam, and through the
        Naam, perishes. By Guru's Grace, the mind and body are
        pleased with the Naam. Meditating on the Naam, the tongue is drenched
        with the Lord's sublime essence. Through this essence,
        the Essence is obtained.  || 7 ||   Rare are those who find the
        Mansion of the Lord's Presence within the mansion of their
        own body. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they lovingly
        focus their consciousness on the True Lord. Whoever the Lord blesses
        with Truth obtains Truth; he merges in Truth, and only Truth.
        || 8 ||   Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind
        and body suffer in pain. Attached to the love of Maya, he earns
        nothing but disease. Without the Name, his mind and body are afflicted
        with leprosy, and he obtains his home in hell.  || 9 ||   Those
        who are imbued with the Naam - their bodies are immaculate
        and pure. Their soul-swan is immaculate, and in the Lord's
        Love, they find eternal peace. Praising the Naam, they find eternal
        peace, and dwell in the home of their own inner being.  || 10
        ||   Everyone deals and trades. Without the Name, all the world
        loses. Naked they come, and naked they go; without the Name, they
        suffer in pain.  || 11 ||   He alone obtains the Naam, unto whom
        the Lord gives it. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. By Guru's Grace, the
        Naam dwells deep within the heart, and one meditates upon the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 12 ||   Everyone who comes into
        the world, longs for the Name. They alone are blessed with the
        Name, whose past actions were so ordained by the Primal Lord.
        Those who obtain the Name are very fortunate. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, they are united with God.  || 13
        ||   Utterly incomparable is the fortress of the body. Within
        it, God sits in contemplation. He administers true justice, and
        trades in Truth; through Him, one finds the eternal, unchanging
        dwelling.  || 14 ||   Deep within the inner self are glorious
        homes and beautiful places. But rare is that person who, as Gurmukh,
        finds these places. If one stays in these places, and praises
        the True Lord, the True Lord comes to dwell in the mind.  || 15
        ||   My Creator Lord has formed this formation. He has placed
        everything within this body. O Nanak, those who deal in the Naam
        are imbued with His Love. The Gurmukh obtains the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 16 || 6 || 20 ||   MARU,  THIRD MEHL:  Contemplating
        the Word of the Shabad, the body becomes golden. The Lord abides
        there; He has no end or limitation. Night and day, serve the Lord,
        and chant the True Word of the Guru's Bani. <br>

      <p> Through the Shabad, meet the Dear Lord.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice
        to those who remember the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, I unite in Union with the Lord. I touch the dust of their
        feet to my face and forehead; sitting in the Society of the Saints,
        I sing His Glorious Praises.  || 2 ||   I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, as I am pleasing to the Lord God. With the Lord's
        Name deep within my inner being, I am adorned with the Word of
        the Shabad. The Word of the Guru's Bani is heard throughout
        the four corners of the world; through it, we merge in the True
        Name.  || 3 ||   That humble being, who searches within himself,
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, sees the Lord with
        his eyes. Through the Guru's Shabad, he applies the ointment
        of spiritual wisdom to his eyes; the Gracious Lord, in His Grace,
        unites him with Himself.  || 4 ||   By great good fortune, I obtained
        this body; in this human life, I have focused my consciousness
        on the Word of the Shabad. Without the Shabad, everything is enveloped
        in utter darkness; only the Gurmukh understands.  || 5 ||   Some
        merely waste away their lives - why have they even come
        into the world? The self-willed manmukhs are attached to the love
        of duality. This opportunity shall not into their hands again;
        their foot slips, and they come to regret and repent.  || 6 ||
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the body is sanctified.
        The True Lord, the ocean of virtue, dwells within it. One who
        sees the Truest of the True everywhere, hears the Truth, and enshrines
        it within his mind.  || 7 ||   Egotism and mental calculations
        are relieved through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Keep
        the Dear Lord close, and enshrine Him in your heart. One who praises
        the Lord forever, through the Guru's Shabad, meets with
        the True Lord, and finds peace.  || 8 ||   He alone remembers
        the Lord, whom the Lord inspires to remember. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, He comes to dwell in the mind. He
        Himself sees, and He Himself understands; He merges all into Himself.
        || 9 ||   He alone knows, who has placed the object within his
        mind. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he comes to
        understand himself. That humble being who understands himself
        is immaculate. He proclaims the Guru's Bani, and the Word
        of the Shabad.  || 10 ||   This body is sanctified and purified;
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it contemplates
        the Lord, the ocean of virtue. One who chants the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord night and day, and remains attuned to His Love, chants
        His Glorious Virtues, immersed in the Glorious Lord.  || 11 ||
        This body is the source of all Maya; in love with duality, it
        is deluded by doubt. It does not remember the Lord, and suffers
        in eternal pain. Without remembering the Lord, it suffers in pain.
        || 12 ||   One who serves the True Guru is approved and respected.
        His body and soul-swan are immaculate and pure; in the Court of
        the Lord, he is known to be true. He serves the Lord, and enshrines
        the Lord in his mind; he is exalted, singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 13 ||   Without good destiny, no one can serve
        the True Guru. The self-willed manmukhs are deluded, and die weeping
        and wailing. Those who are blessed by the Guru's Glance
        of Grace - the Dear Lord unites them with Himself.  ||
        14 ||   In the body fortress, are the solidly-constructed markets.
        The Gurmukh purchases the object, and takes care of it. Meditating
        on the Name of the Lord, day and night, he attains the sublime,
        exalted status.  || 15 ||   The True Lord Himself is the Giver
        of peace. Through the Shabad of the Perfect Guru, He is realized.
        Nanak praises the Naam, the True Name of the Lord; through perfect
        destiny, He is found. <br>
