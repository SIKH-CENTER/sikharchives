      <p> Night and day, they meditate on the Lord, the Sustainer of the
        Earth. O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they
        are detached, in the perfect balance of Nirvaanaa.  || 4 || 13
        || 33 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  THIRD MEHL:  Through great good
        fortune and high destiny, one meets the True Guru. The Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, is constantly within the heart, and one enjoys
        the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O mortal, become Gurmukh,
        and meditate on the Name of the Lord. Be victorious in the game
        of life, and earn the profit of the Naam.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Spiritual wisdom and meditation come to those unto whom the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad is sweet. By Guru's Grace,
        a few have tasted, and seen it.  || 2 ||   They may perform all
        sorts of religious rituals and good actions, but without the Name,
        the egotistical ones are cursed and doomed.  || 3 ||   They are
        bound and gagged, and hung by Maya's noose; O servant Nanak,
        they shall be released only by Guru's Grace.  || 4 || 14
        || 34 ||   THIRD MEHL,  GAUREE BAIRAAGAN:  The clouds pour their
        rain down upon the earth, but isn't there water within the
        earth as well? Water is contained within the earth; without feet,
        the clouds run around and let down their rain.  || 1 ||   O Baba,
        get rid of your doubts like this. As you act, so shall you become,
        and so you shall go and mingle.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As woman
        or man, what can anyone do? The many and various forms are always
        Yours, O Lord; they shall merge again into You.  || 2 ||   In
        countless incarnations, I went astray. Now that I have found You,
        I shall no longer wander. It is His work; those who are absorbed
        in the Word of the Guru's Shabad come to know it well.  ||
        3 ||   The Shabad is Yours; You are Yourself. Where is there any
        doubt? O Nanak, one whose essence is merged with the Lord's
        essence does not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation again.
        || 4 || 1 || 15 || 35 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  THIRD MEHL:  The
        whole world is under the power of Death, bound by the love of
        duality. The self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in ego; they
        receive their just rewards.  || 1 ||   O my mind, focus your consciousness
        on the Guru's Feet. As Gurmukh, you shall be awarded the
        treasure of the Naam. In the Court of the Lord, you shall be saved.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Through 8.4 million incarnations, people
        wander lost; in stubborn-mindedness, they come and go. They do
        not realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad; they are reincarnated
        over and over again.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukh understands his own
        self. The Lord's Name comes to dwell within the mind. Imbued
        with devotion to the Lord's Name, night and day, he merges
        in peace.  || 3 ||   When one's mind dies in the Shabad,
        one radiates faith and confidence, shedding egotism and corruption.
        O servant Nanak, through the karma of good actions, the treasure
        of devotional worship and the Name of the Lord are attained. 
        || 4 || 2 || 16 || 36 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  THIRD MEHL:  The
        Lord, Har, Har, has ordained that the soul is to stay in her parents'
        home for only a few short days. Glorious is that soul-bride, who
        as Gurmukh, sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. She who cultivates
        virtue in her parents' home, shall obtain a home at her in-laws.
        The Gurmukhs are intuitively absorbed into the Lord. The Lord
        is pleasing to their minds.  || 1 ||   Our Husband Lord dwells
        in this world, and in the world beyond. Tell me, how can He be
        found? </p>

      <p> The Immaculate Lord Himself is unseen. He unites us with Himself.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God Himself bestows wisdom; meditate on
        the Name of the Lord. By great good fortune, one meets the True
        Guru, who places the Ambrosial Nectar in the mouth. When egotism
        and duality are eradicated, one intuitively merges in peace. He
        Himself is All-pervading; He Himself links us to His Name.  ||
        2 ||   The self-willed manmukhs, in their arrogant pride, do not
        find God; they are so ignorant and foolish! They do not serve
        the True Guru, and in the end, they regret and repent, over and
        over again. They are cast into the womb to be reincarnated, and
        within the womb, they rot. As it pleases my Creator Lord, the
        self-willed manmukhs wander around lost.  || 3 ||   My Lord God
        inscribed the full pre-ordained destiny upon the forehead. When
        one meets the Great and Courageous Guru, one meditates on the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Lord's Name is my mother
        and father; the Lord is my relative and brother. O Lord, Har,
        Har, please forgive me and unite me with Yourself. Servant Nanak
        is a lowly worm.  || 4 || 3 || 17 || 37 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,
        THIRD MEHL:  From the True Guru, I obtained spiritual wisdom;
        I contemplate the Lord's essence. My polluted intellect was
        enlightened by chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The distinction
        between Shiva and Shakti  -  mind and matter  -  has been
        destroyed, and the darkness has been dispelled. The Lord's
        Name is loved by those, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained
        destiny was written.  || 1 ||   How can the Lord be obtained,
        O Saints? Seeing Him, my life is sustained. Without the Lord,
        I cannot live, even for an instant. Unite me with the Guru, so
        that I may drink in the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and I listen
        to them daily; the Lord, Har, Har, has emancipated me. I have
        obtained the Lord's essence from the Guru; my mind and body
        are drenched with it. Blessed, blessed is the Guru, the True Being,
        who has blessed me with devotional worship of the Lord. From the
        Guru, I have obtained the Lord; I have made Him my Guru.  || 2
        ||   The Sovereign Lord is the Giver of virtue. I am worthless
        and without virtue. The sinners sink like stones; through the
        Guru's Teachings, the Lord carries us across. You are the
        Giver of virtue, O Immaculate Lord; I am worthless and without
        virtue. I have entered Your Sanctuary, Lord; please save me, as
        You have saved the idiots and fools.  || 3 ||   Eternal celestial
        bliss comes through the Guru's Teachings, by meditating continually
        on the Lord, Har, Har. I have obtained the Lord God as my Best
        Friend, within the home of my own self. I sing the Songs of Joy.
        Please shower me with Your Mercy, O Lord God, that I may meditate
        on Your Name, Har, Har. Servant Nanak begs for the dust of the
        feet of those who have found the True Guru.  || 4 || 4 || 18 ||

      <p> The Pandit  -  the religious scholar  -  recites the Shaastras
        and the Simritees; the Yogi cries out, &quot;Gorakh, Gorakh&quot;.
        But I am just a fool  -  I just chant the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 1 ||   I do not know what my condition shall be,

      <p> You shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Sannyaasee smears his body with ashes; renouncing other
        men's women, he practices celibacy. I am just a fool, Lord;
        I place my hopes in You!  || 2 ||   The Kh'shaatriya acts
        bravely, and is recognized as a warrior. The Shoodra and the Vaisha
        work and slave for others; I am just a fool  -  I am saved
        by the Lord's Name.  || 3 ||   The entire Universe is Yours;
        You Yourself permeate and pervade it. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are
        blessed with glorious greatness. I am blind  -  I have taken
        the Lord as my Support.  || 4 || 1 || 39 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,
        FOURTH MEHL:  The Speech of the Lord is the most sublime speech,
        free of any attributes. Vibrate on it, meditate on it, and join
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Cross over the terrifying
        world-ocean, listening to the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||   O Lord of the Universe, unite me with the Sat Sangat, the
        True Congregation. My tongue savors the sublime essence of the
        Lord, singing the Lord's Glorious Praises.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Those humble beings who meditate on the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har  -  please make me the slave of their slaves, Lord.
        Serving Your slaves is the ultimate good deed.  || 2 ||   One
        who chants the Speech of the Lord  -  that humble servant is
        pleasing to my conscious mind. Those who are blessed with great
        good fortune obtain the dust of the feet of the humble.  || 3
        ||   Those who are blessed with such pre-ordained destiny are
        in love with the humble Saints. Those humble beings, O Nanak,
        are absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 2 ||
        40 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The mother loves to
        see her son eat. The fish loves to bathe in the water. The True
        Guru loves to place food in the mouth of His GurSikh.  || 1 ||
        If only I could meet those humble servants of the Lord, O my
        Beloved. Meeting with them, my sorrows depart.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   As the cow shows her love to her strayed calf when she finds
        it, and as the bride shows her love for her husband when he returns
        home, so does the Lord's humble servant love to sing the
        Praises of the Lord.  || 2 ||   The sparrow-hawk loves the rainwater,
        falling in torrents; the king loves to see his wealth on display.
        The humble servant of the Lord loves to meditate on the Formless
        Lord.  || 3 ||   The mortal man loves to accumulate wealth and
        property. The GurSikh loves to meet and embrace the Guru. Servant
        Nanak loves to kiss the feet of the Holy.  || 4 || 3 || 41 ||
        GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The beggar loves to receive
        charity from the wealthy landlord. The hungry person loves to
        eat food. The GurSikh loves to find satisfaction by meeting the
        Guru.  || 1 ||   O Lord, grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan;
        I place my hopes in You, Lord. Shower me with Your Mercy, and
        fulfill my longing.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The song-bird loves
        the sun shining in her face. Meeting her Beloved, all her pains
        are left behind. The GurSikh loves to gaze upon the Face of the
        Guru.  || 2 ||   The calf loves to suck its mother's milk;
        its heart blossoms forth upon seeing its mother. The GurSikh loves
        to gaze upon the Face of the Guru.  || 3 ||   All other loves
        and emotional attachment to Maya are false. They shall pass away,
        like false and transitory decorations. </p>

      <p> Servant Nanak is fulfilled, through the Love of the True Guru.
        || 4 || 4 || 42 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  Service
        to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding; meeting Him, I meditate
        on the Name of the Lord, the Lord Master. So many are emancipated
        along with those who meditate on the Lord.  || 1 ||   O GurSikhs,
        chant the Name of the Lord, O my Siblings of Destiny. Chanting
        the Lord's Name, all sins are washed away.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   When one meets the Guru, then the mind becomes centered.
        The five passions, running wild, are brought to rest by meditating
        on the Lord. Night and day, within the body-village, the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord are sung.  || 2 ||   Those who apply the dust
        of the Feet of the True Guru to their faces, renounce falsehood
        and enshrine love for the Lord. Their faces are radiant in the
        Court of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.  || 3 ||   Service to
        the Guru is pleasing to the Lord Himself. Even Krishna and Balbhadar
        meditated on the Lord, falling at the Guru's Feet. O Nanak,
        the Lord Himself saves the Gurmukhs.  || 4 || 5 || 43 ||   GAUREE
        GWAARAYREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord Himself is the Yogi, who wields
        the staff of authority. The Lord Himself practices tapa  - 
        intense self-disciplined meditation; He is deeply absorbed in
        His primal trance.  || 1 ||   Such is my Lord, who is all-pervading
        everywhere. He dwells near at hand  -  the Lord is not far
        away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord Himself is the Word of the
        Shabad. He Himself is the awareness, attuned to its music. The
        Lord Himself beholds, and He Himself blossoms forth. The Lord
        Himself chants, and the Lord Himself inspires others to chant.
        || 2 ||   He Himself is the sparrow-hawk, and the Ambrosial Nectar
        raining down. The Lord is the Ambrosial Nectar; He Himself leads
        us to drink it in. The Lord Himself is the Doer; He Himself is
        our Saving Grace.  || 3 ||   The Lord Himself is the Boat, the
        Raft and the Boatman. The Lord Himself, through the Guru's
        Teachings, saves us. O Nanak, the Lord Himself carries us across
        to the other side.  || 4 || 6 || 44 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  O Master, You are my Banker. I receive only that capital
        which You give me. I would purchase the Lord's Name with
        love, if You Yourself, in Your Mercy, would sell it to me.  ||
        1 ||   I am the merchant, the peddler of the Lord. I trade in
        the merchandise and capital of the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I have earned the profit, the wealth of devotional
        worship of the Lord. I have become pleasing to the Mind of the
        Lord, the True Banker. I chant and meditate on the Lord, loading
        the merchandise of the Lord's Name. The Messenger of Death,
        the tax collector, does not even approach me.  || 2 ||   Those
        traders who trade in other merchandise, are caught up in the endless
        waves of the pain of Maya. According to the business in which
        the Lord has placed them, so are the rewards they obtain.  ||
        3 ||   People trade in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, when the
        God shows His Mercy and bestows it. Servant Nanak serves the Lord,
        the Banker; he shall never again be called to render his account.
        || 4 || 1 || 7 || 45 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FOURTH MEHL:  The

      <p> In just the same way, the humble servant of the Lord loves the
        Lord, who extends His Helping Hand to us.  || 1 ||   O my Lord,
        I am so foolish; save me, O my Lord God! Your servant's praise
        is Your Own Glorious Greatness.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those whose
        minds are pleased by the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, are joyful
        in the palaces of their own homes. Their mouths savor all the
        sweet delicacies when they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        The Lord's humble servants are the saviors of their families;
        they save their families for twenty-one generations  -  they
        save the entire world!  || 2 ||   Whatever has been done, has
        been done by the Lord; it is the Glorious Greatness of the Lord.
        O Lord, in Your creatures, You are pervading; You inspire them
        to worship You. The Lord leads us to the treasure of devotional
        worship; He Himself bestows it.  || 3 ||   I am a slave, purchased
        in Your market; what clever tricks do I have? If the Lord were
        to set me upon a throne, I would still be His slave. If I were
        a grass-cutter, I would still chant the Lord's Name. Servant
        Nanak is the slave of the Lord; contemplate the Glorious Greatness
        of the Lord  || 4 || 2 || 8 || 46 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  The farmers love to work their farms; they plow and work
        the fields, so that their sons and daughters may eat. In just
        the same way, the Lord's humble servants chant the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, and in the end, the Lord shall save them.
        || 1 ||   I am foolish  -  save me, O my Lord! O Lord, enjoin
        me to work and serve the Guru, the True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The traders buy horses, planning to trade them. They hope
        to earn wealth; their attachment to Maya increases. In just the
        same way, the Lord's humble servants chant the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har; chanting the Lord's Name, they find peace.
        || 2 ||   The shop-keepers collect poison, sitting in their shops,
        carrying on their business. Their love is false, their displays
        are false, and they are engrossed in falsehood. In just the same
        way, the Lord's humble servants gather the wealth of the
        Lord's Name; they take the Lord's Name as their supplies.
        || 3 ||   This emotional attachment to Maya and family, and the
        love of duality, is a noose around the neck. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, the humble servants are carried across; they become
        the slaves of the Lord's slaves. Servant Nanak meditates
        on the Naam; the Gurmukh is enlightened.  || 4 || 3 || 9 || 47
        ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FOURTH MEHL:  Continuously, day and night,
        they are gripped by greed and deluded by doubt. The slaves labor
        in slavery, carrying the loads upon their heads. That humble being
        who serves the Guru is put to work by the Lord in His Home.  ||
        1 ||   O my Lord, please break these bonds of Maya, and put me
        to work in Your Home. I continuously sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord; I am absorbed in the Lord's Name.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Mortal men work for kings, all for the sake of wealth
        and Maya. But the king either imprisons them, or fines them, or
        else dies himself. Blessed, rewarding and fruitful is the service
        of the True Guru; through it, I chant the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, and I have found peace.  || 2 ||   Everyday, people carry
        on their business, with all sorts of devices to earn interest,
        for the sake of Maya. If they earn a profit, they are pleased,
        but their hearts are broken by losses. One who is worthy, becomes
        a partner with the Guru, and finds a lasting peace forever.  ||

      <p> The more one feels hunger for other tastes and pleasures, the
        more this hunger persists. Those unto whom the Lord Himself shows
        mercy, sell their head to the Guru. Servant Nanak is satisfied
        by the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. He shall never feel hungry
        again.  || 4 || 4 || 10 || 48 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FOURTH MEHL:
        Within my conscious mind is the constant longing for the Lord.
        How can I behold the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, Lord? One
        who loves the Lord knows this; the Lord is very dear to my conscious
        mind. I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has re-united me with my
        Creator Lord; I was separated from Him for such a long time! 
        || 1 ||   O my Lord, I am a sinner; I have come to Your Sanctuary,
        and fallen at Your Door, Lord. My intellect is worthless; I am
        filthy and polluted. Please shower me with Your Mercy sometime.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My demerits are so many and numerous. I
        have sinned so many times, over and over again. O Lord, they cannot
        be counted. You, Lord, are the Merciful Treasure of Virtue. When
        it pleases You, Lord, You forgive me. I am a sinner, saved only
        by the Company of the Guru. He has bestowed the Teachings of the
        Lord's Name, which saves me.  || 2 ||   What Glorious Virtues
        of Yours can I describe, O my True Guru? When the Guru speaks,
        I am transfixed with wonder. Can anyone else save a sinner like
        me? The True Guru has protected and saved me. O Guru, You are
        my father. O Guru, You are my mother. O Guru, You are my relative,
        companion and friend.  || 3 ||   My condition, O my True Guru
        -  that condition, O Lord, is known only to You. I was rolling
        around in the dirt, and no one cared for me at all. In the Company
        of the Guru, the True Guru, I, the worm, have been raised up and
        exalted. Blessed, blessed is the Guru of servant Nanak; meeting
        Him, all my sorrows and troubles have come to an end.  || 4 ||
        5 || 11 || 49 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FOURTH MEHL:  The soul of
        the man is lured by gold and women; emotional attachment to Maya
        is so sweet to him. The mind has become attached to the pleasures
        of houses, palaces, horses and other enjoyments. The Lord God
        does not even enter his thoughts; how can he be saved, O my Lord
        King?  || 1 ||   O my Lord, these are my lowly actions, O my Lord.
        O Lord, Har, Har, Treasure of Virtue, Merciful Lord: please bless
        me with Your Grace and forgive me for all my mistakes.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I have no beauty, no social status, no manners. With
        what face am I to speak? I have no virtue at all; I have not chanted
        Your Name. I am a sinner, saved only by the Company of the Guru.
        This is the generous blessing of the True Guru.  || 2 ||   He
        gave all beings souls, bodies, mouths, noses and water to drink.
        He gave them corn to eat, clothes to wear, and other pleasures
        to enjoy. But they do not remember the One who gave them all this.
        The animals think that they made themselves!  || 3 ||   You made
        them all; You are all-pervading. You are the Inner-knower, the
        Searcher of hearts. What can these wretched creatures do? This
        whole drama is Yours, O Lord and Master. Servant Nanak was purchased
        in the slave-market. </p>

        50 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,  FOURTH MEHL:  Just as the mother, having
        given birth to a son, feeds him and keeps him in her vision  - 
        indoors and outdoors, she puts food in his mouth; each and every
        moment, she caresses him. In just the same way, the True Guru
        protects His GurSikhs, who love their Beloved Lord.  || 1 || 
        O my Lord, we are just the ignorant children of our Lord God.
        Hail, hail, to the Guru, the Guru, the True Guru, the Divine Teacher
        who has made me wise through the Lord's Teachings.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The white flamingo circles through the sky, but
        she keeps her young ones in her mind; she has left them behind,
        but she constantly remembers them in her heart. In just the same
        way, the True Guru loves His Sikhs. The Lord cherishes His GurSikhs,
        and keeps them clasped to His Heart.  || 2 ||   Just as the tongue,
        made of flesh and blood, is protected within the scissors of the
        thirty-two teeth  -  who thinks that the power lies in the
        flesh or the scissors? Everything is in the Power of the Lord.
        In just the same way, when someone slanders the Saint, the Lord
        preserves the honor of His servant.  || 3 ||   O Siblings of Destiny,
        let none think that they have any power. All act as the Lord causes
        them to act. Old age, death, fever, poisons and snakes  - 
        everything is in the Hands of the Lord. Nothing can touch anyone
        without the Lord's Order. Within your conscious mind, O servant
        Nanak, meditate forever on the Name of the Lord, who shall deliver
        you in the end.  || 4 || 7 || 13 || 51 ||   GAUREE BAIRAAGAN,
        FOURTH MEHL:  Meeting Him, the mind is filled with bliss. He
        is called the True Guru. Double-mindedness departs, and the supreme
        status of the Lord is obtained.  || 1 ||   How can I meet my Beloved
        True Guru? Each and every moment, I humbly bow to Him. How will
        I meet my Perfect Guru?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Granting His Grace,
        the Lord has led me to meet my Perfect True Guru. The desire of
        His humble servant has been fulfilled. I have received the dust
        of the Feet of the True Guru.  || 2 ||   Those who meet the True
        Guru implant devotional worship to the Lord, and listen to this
        devotional worship of the Lord. They never suffer any loss; they
        continually earn the profit of the Lord.  || 3 ||   One whose
        heart blossoms forth, is not in love with duality. O Nanak, meeting
        the Guru, one is saved, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        || 4 || 8 || 14 || 52 ||   FOURTH MEHL,  GAUREE POORBEE:  The
        Merciful Lord God showered me with His Mercy; with mind and body
        and mouth, I chant the Lord's Name. As Gurmukh, I have been
        dyed in the deep and lasting color of the Lord's Love. The
        robe of my body is drenched with His Love.  || 1 ||   I am the
        maid-servant of my Lord God. When my mind surrendered to the Lord,
        He made all the world my slave.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Consider
        this well, O Saints, O Siblings of Destiny  -  search your
        own hearts, seek and find Him there. The Beauty and the Light
        of the Lord, Har, Har, is present in all. </p>

        The Lord, Har, Har, dwells close by, all over the world. He
        is Infinite, All-powerful and Immeasurable. The Perfect Guru has
        revealed the Lord, Har, Har, to me. I have sold my head to the
        Guru.  || 3 ||   O Dear Lord, inside and outside, I am in the
        protection of Your Sanctuary; You are the Greatest of the Great,
        All-powerful Lord. Servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord, night and day, meeting the Guru, the True Guru, the
        Divine Intermediary.  || 4 || 1 || 15 || 53 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,
        FOURTH MEHL:  Life of the World, Infinite Lord and Master, Master
        of the Universe, All-powerful Architect of Destiny. Whichever
        way You turn me, O my Lord and Master, that is the way I shall
        go.  || 1 ||   O Lord, my mind is attuned to the Lord's Love.
        Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have obtained
        the sublime essence of the Lord. I am absorbed in the Name of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord, Har, Har, and the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har, is the panacea, the medicine for the world.
        The Lord, and the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, bring peace and
        tranquility. Those who partake of the Lord's sublime essence,
        through the Guru's Teachings  -  their sins and sufferings
        are all eliminated.  || 2 ||   Those who have such pre-ordained
        destiny inscribed on their foreheads, bathe in the pool of contentment
        of the Guru. The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away,
        from those who are imbued with the Love of the Lord's Name.
        || 3 ||   O Lord, You Yourself are Your Own Master, O God. There
        is no other Giver as Great as You. Servant Nanak lives by the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord; by the Lord's Mercy, he chants
        the Lord's Name.  || 4 || 2 || 16 || 54 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,
        FOURTH MEHL:  Show Mercy to me, O Life of the World, O Great
        Giver, so that my mind may merge with the Lord. The True Guru
        has bestowed His most pure and sacred Teachings. Chanting the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, my mind is transfixed and enraptured.
        || 1 ||   O Lord, my mind and body have been pierced through
        by the True Lord. The whole world is caught and held in the mouth
        of Death. Through the Teachings of the Guru, the True Guru, O
        Lord, I am saved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who are not in love
        with the Lord are foolish and false  -  they are faithless
        cynics. They suffer the most extreme agonies of birth and death;
        they die over and over again, and they rot away in manure.  ||
        2 ||   You are the Merciful Cherisher of those who seek Your Sanctuary.
        I beg of You: please grant me Your gift, Lord. Make me the slave
        of the Lord's slaves, so that my mind might dance in Your
        Love.  || 3 ||   He Himself is the Great Banker; God is our Lord
        and Master. I am His petty merchant. My mind, body and soul are
        all Your capital assets. You, O God, are the True Banker of servant
        Nanak.  || 4 || 3 || 17 || 55 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,  FOURTH MEHL:
        You are Merciful, the Destroyer of all pain. Please give me Your
        Ear and listen to my prayer. Please unite me with the True Guru,
        my breath of life; through Him, O my Lord and Master, You are
        known.  || 1 ||   O Lord, I acknowledge the True Guru as the Supreme
        Lord God. I am foolish and ignorant, and my intellect is impure.
        Through the Teachings of the Guru, the True Guru, O Lord, I come
        to know You.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> All the pleasures and enjoyments which I have seen  -  I have
        found them all to be bland and insipid. I have tasted the Ambrosial
        Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, by meeting the True
        Guru. It is sweet, like the juice of the sugarcane.  || 2 || 
        Those who have not met the Guru, the True Guru, are foolish and
        insane  -  they are faithless cynics. Those who were pre-ordained
        to have no good karma at all  -  gazing into the lamp of emotional
        attachment, they are burnt, like moths in a flame.  || 3 ||  
        Those whom You, in Your Mercy, have met, Lord, are committed to
        Your Service. Servant Nanak chants the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, Har. He is famous, and through the Guru's Teachings,
        He merges in the Name.  || 4 || 4 || 18 || 56 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,
        FOURTH MEHL:  O my mind, God is always with you; He is your Lord
        and Master. Tell me, where could you run to get away from the
        Lord? The True Lord God Himself grants forgiveness; we are emancipated
        only when the Lord Himself emancipates us.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har  -  chant it in your
        mind. Quickly now, run to the Sanctuary of the True Guru, O my
        mind; following the Guru, the True Guru, you shall be saved. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O my mind, serve God, the Giver of all peace;
        serving Him, you shall come to dwell in your own home deep within.
        As Gurmukh, go and enter your own home; anoint yourself with the
        sandalwood oil of the Lord's Praises.  || 2 ||   O my mind,
        the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, are exalted
        and sublime. Earn the profit of the Lord's Name, and let
        your mind be happy. If the Lord, Har, Har, in His Mercy, bestows
        it, then we partake of the ambrosial essence of the Lord's
        Name.  || 3 ||   O my mind, without the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, and attached to duality, those faithless cynics are strangled
        by the Messenger of Death. Such faithless cynics, who have forgotten
        the Naam, are thieves. O my mind, do not even go near them.  ||
        4 ||   O my mind, serve the Unknowable and Immaculate Lord, the
        Man-lion; serving Him, your account will be cleared. The Lord
        God has made servant Nanak perfect; he is not diminished by even
        the tiniest particle.  || 5 || 5 || 19 || 57 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,

        and body are totally Yours. Be merciful to me, and show me the
        Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. There is such a great longing
        within my mind and body!  || 1 ||   O my Lord, there is such a
        great longing within my mind and body to meet the Lord. When the
        Guru, the Merciful Guru, showed just a little mercy to me, my
        Lord God came and met me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whatever is in
        my conscious mind, O Lord and Master  -  that condition of
        mine is known only to You, Lord. Night and day, I chant Your Name,
        and I find peace. I live by placing my hopes in You, Lord.  ||
        2 ||   The Guru, the True Guru, the Giver, has shown me the Way;
        my Lord God came and met me. Night and day, I am filled with bliss;
        by great good fortune, all of the hopes of His humble servant
        have been fulfilled.  || 3 ||   O Lord of the World, Master of
        the Universe, everything is under Your control. Servant Nanak
        has come to Your Sanctuary, Lord; please, preserve the honor of
        Your humble servant.  || 4 || 6 || 20 || 58 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,

      <p> Distracted by all sorts of distractions, it wanders around aimlessly
        in the ten directions. I have found the Perfect Guru, through
        great good fortune; He has given me the Mantra of the Lord's
        Name, and my mind has become quiet and tranquil.  || 1 ||   O
        Lord, I am the slave of the True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My
        forehead has been branded with His brand; I owe such a great debt
        to the Guru. He has been so generous and kind to me; He has carried
        me across the treacherous and terrifying world-ocean.  || 2 ||
        Those who do not have love for the Lord within their hearts,
        harbor only false intentions and goals. As paper breaks down and
        dissolves in water, the self-willed manmukh wastes away in arrogant
        pride.  || 3 ||   I know nothing, and I do not know the future;

        O Guru, grant me Your Grace; servant Nanak is Your obedient dog.
        || 4 || 7 || 21 || 59 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The
        body-village is filled to overflowing with sexual desire and anger,
        which were broken into bits when I met with the Holy Saint. By
        pre-ordained destiny, I have met with the Guru. I have entered
        into the realm of the Lord's Love.  || 1 ||   Greet the Holy
        Saint with your palms pressed together; this is an act of great
        merit. Bow down before Him; this is a virtuous action indeed.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The wicked shaaktas, the faithless cynics,
        do not know the taste of the Lord's sublime essence. The
        thorn of egotism is embedded deep within them. The more they walk
        away, the deeper it sticks into them, and the more they suffer
        in pain, until finally, the Messenger of Death smashes his club
        against their heads.  || 2 ||   The humble servants of the Lord
        are absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The pain of birth
        and the fear of death are eradicated. They have obtained the Imperishable
        Supreme Being, the Transcendent Lord God, and they obtain great
        honor throughout all the worlds and realms.  || 3 ||   I am poor
        and meek, God, but I am Yours! Save me, please save me, O Greatest
        of the Great! Servant Nanak takes the Sustenance and Support of
        the Naam. In the Name of the Lord, he enjoys celestial peace.

        this body-fortress is the Lord, the Sovereign Lord King, but the
        stubborn ones do not find the taste. When the Lord, Merciful to
        the meek, showed His Mercy, I found and tasted it, through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||   Lovingly focused upon
        the Guru, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise has become sweet
        to me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord, the Supreme Lord God, is
        Inaccessible and Unfathomable. Those who are committed to the
        True Guru, the Divine Intermediary, meet the Lord. Those whose
        hearts are pleased with the Guru's Teachings  -  the Lord's
        Presence is revealed to them.  || 2 ||   The hearts of the self-willed
        manmukhs are hard and cruel; their inner beings are dark. Even
        if the poisonous snake is fed large amounts of milk, it will still
        yield only poison.  || 3 ||   O Lord God, please unite me with
        the Holy Guru, so that I might joyfully grind and eat the Shabad.
        Servant Nanak is the slave of the Guru; in the Sangat, the Holy

        me. A very blessed and fortunate destiny is recorded upon my forehead.

        preserve my honor, Lord, as it pleases Your Will.  || 4 || 11
        || 25 || 63 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  Through the Guru's
        Teachings, the unstruck music resounds; through the Guru's
        Teachings, the mind sings. By great good fortune, I received the
        Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. Blessed, blessed is
        the Guru, who has led me to love the Lord.  || 1 ||   The Gurmukh
        is lovingly centered on the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My Lord
        and Master is the Perfect True Guru. My mind works to serve the
        Guru. I massage and wash the Feet of the Guru, who recites the
        Sermon of the Lord.  || 2 ||   The Teachings of the Guru are in
        my heart; the Lord is the Source of nectar. My tongue sings the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord. My mind is immersed in, and drenched
        with the Lord's essence. Fulfilled with the Lord's Love,
        I shall never feel hunger again.  || 3 ||   People try all sorts
        of things, but without the Lord's Mercy, His Name is not
        obtained. The Lord has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak;
        through the wisdom of the Guru's Teachings, he has enshrined
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 12 || 26 || 64 ||   RAAG
        GAUREE MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  O my soul, as Gurmukh, do this deed:
        chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Make that teaching your
        mother, that it may teach you to keep the Lord's Name in
        your mouth. <br>
