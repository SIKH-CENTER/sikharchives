      <p> Without serving the True Guru, one's speech is vapid and
        insipid; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, does not abide in his
        mind. O Nanak, without serving the True Guru, they are bound and
        beaten in the City of Death; they arise and depart with blackened
        faces.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Burn away those rituals which lead
        you to forget the Beloved Lord. O Nanak, sublime is that love,
        which preserves my honor with my Lord Master.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Serve the One Lord, the Great Giver; meditate on the One Lord.
        Beg from the One Lord, the Great Giver, and you shall obtain your
        heart's desires. But if you beg from another, then you shall
        be shamed and destroyed. One who serves the Lord obtains the fruits
        of his rewards; all of his hunger is satisfied. Nanak is a sacrifice
        to those, who night and day, meditate within their hearts on the
        Name of the Lord.  || 10 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  He Himself
        is pleased with His humble devotees; my Beloved Lord attaches
        them to Himself. The Lord blesses His humble devotees with royalty;
        He fashions the true crown upon their heads. They are always at
        peace, and immaculately pure; they perform service for the True
        Guru. They are not said to be kings, who die in conflict, and
        then enter again the cycle of reincarnation. O Nanak, without
        the Name of the Lord, they wander about with their noses cut off
        in disgrace; they get no respect at all.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        Hearing the teachings, he does not appreciate them, as long as
        he is not Gurmukh, attached to the Word of the Shabad. Serving
        the True Guru, the Naam comes to abide in the mind, and doubts
        and fears run away. As he knows the True Guru, so he is transformed,
        and then, he lovingly focuses his consciousness on the Naam. O
        Nanak, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, greatness is obtained;
        he shall be resplendent in the Court of the Lord hereafter.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  The minds of the Gursikhs are filled with the
        love of the Lord; they come and worship the Guru. They trade lovingly
        in the Lord's Name, and depart after earning the profit of
        the Lord's Name. The faces of the Gursikhs are radiant; in
        the Court of the Lord, they are approved. The Guru, the True Guru,
        is the treasure of the Lord's Name; how very fortunate are
        the Sikhs who share in this treasure of virtue. I am a sacrifice
        to those Gursikhs who, sitting and standing, meditate on the Lord's
        Name.  || 11 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, is the treasure, which the Gurmukhs obtain.
        The self-willed manmukhs are blind; they do not realize that it
        is within their own home. They die barking and crying.  || 1 ||
        THIRD MEHL:  That body is golden and immaculate, which is attached
        to the True Name of the True Lord. The Gurmukh obtains the Pure
        Light of the Luminous Lord, and his doubts and fears run away.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukhs find lasting peace; night and day, they
        remain detached, while in the Love of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Blessed, blessed are those Gursikhs, who, with their ears, listen
        to the Guru's Teachings about the Lord. The Guru, the True
        Guru, implants the Naam within them, and their egotism and duality
        are silenced. There is no friend, other than the Name of the Lord;
        the Lord's humble servants reflect upon this and see. </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Those Gursikhs, with whom the Lord is pleased, accept the Word
        of the True Guru. Those Gurmukhs who meditate on the Naam are
        imbued with the four-fold color of the Lord's Love.  || 12
        ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh is cowardly
        and ugly; lacking the Name of the Lord, his nose is cut off in
        disgrace. Night and day, he is engrossed in worldly affairs, and
        even in his dreams, he finds no peace. O Nanak, if he becomes
        Gurmukh, then he shall be saved; otherwise, he is held in bondage,
        and suffers in pain.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukhs always
        look beautiful in the Court of the Lord; they practice the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad. There is a lasting peace and happiness
        deep within them; at the Court of the True Lord, they receive
        honor. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are blessed with the Name of the
        Lord; they merge imperceptibly into the True Lord.  || 2 ||  
        PAUREE:  As Gurmukh, Prahlaad meditated on the Lord, and was saved.
        As Gurmukh, Janak lovingly centered his consciousness on the Lord's
        Name. As Gurmukh, Vashisht taught the Teachings of the Lord. Without
        the Guru, no one has found the Lord's Name, O my Siblings
        of Destiny. The Lord blesses the Gurmukh with devotion.  || 13
        ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  One who has no faith in the True Guru,
        and who does not love the Word of the Shabad, shall find no peace,
        even though he may come and go hundreds of times. O Nanak, the
        Gurmukh meets the True Lord with natural ease; he is in love with
        the Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O mind, search for such a True
        Guru, by serving whom the pains of birth and death are dispelled.
        Doubt shall never afflict you, and your ego shall be burnt away
        through the Word of the Shabad. The veil of falsehood shall be
        torn down from within you, and Truth shall come to dwell in the
        mind. Peace and happiness shall fill your mind deep within, if
        you act according to truth and self-discipline. O Nanak, by perfect
        good karma, you shall meet the True Guru, and then the Dear Lord,
        by His Sweet Will, shall bless you with His Mercy.  || 2 ||  
        PAUREE:  The whole world comes under the control of one whose
        home is filled with the Lord, the King. He is subject to no one
        else's rule, and the Lord, the King, causes everyone to fall
        at his feet. One may run away from the courts of other men, but
        where can one go to escape the Lord's Kingdom? The Lord is
        such a King, who abides in the hearts of His devotees; He brings
        the others, and makes them stand before His devotees. The glorious
        greatness of the Lord's Name is obtained only by His Grace;
        how few are the Gurmukhs who meditate on Him.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  Without serving the True Guru, the people of the
        world are dead; they waste their lives away in vain. In love with
        duality, they suffer terrible pain; they die, and are reincarnated,
        and continue coming and going. They live in manure, and are reincarnated
        again and again. O Nanak, without the Name, the Messenger of Death
        punishes them; in the end, they depart regretting and repenting.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  In this world, there is one Husband Lord;
        all other beings are His brides. </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> He enjoys the hearts of all, and yet He remains detached; He is
        unseen; He cannot be described. The Perfect Guru reveals Him,
        and through the Word of His Shabad, we come to understand Him.
        Those who serve their Husband Lord, become like Him; their egos
        are burnt away by His Shabad. He has no rival, no attacker, no
        enemy. His rule is unchanging and eternal; He does not come or
        go. Night and day, His servant serves Him, singing the Glorious
        Praises of the True Lord. Beholding the Glorious Greatness of
        the True Lord, Nanak blossoms forth.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those
        whose hearts are forever filled with the Name of the Lord, have
        the Name of the Lord as their Protector. The Lord's Name
        is my father, the Lord's Name is my mother; the Lord's
        Name is my helper and friend. My conversation is with the Lord's
        Name, and my counseling is with the Lord's Name; the Lord's
        Name always takes care of me. The Lord's Name is my most
        beloved society, the Lord's Name is my ancestry, and the
        Lord's Name is my family. The Guru, the Lord Incarnate, has
        bestowed upon servant Nanak the Name of the Lord; in this world,
        and in the next, the Lord ever saves me.  || 15 ||   SHALOK, 
        THIRD MEHL:  Those who meet the True Guru, ever sing the Kirtan
        of the Lord's Praises. The Lord's Name naturally fills
        their minds, and they are absorbed in the Shabad, the Word of
        the True Lord. They redeem their generations, and they themselves
        obtain the state of liberation. The Supreme Lord God is pleased
        with those who fall at the Guru's Feet. Servant Nanak is
        the Lord's slave; by His Grace, the Lord preserves his honor.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  In egotism, one is assailed by fear; he
        passes his life totally troubled by fear. Egotism is such a terrible
        disease; he dies, to be reincarnated  -  he continues coming
        and going. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny meet with
        the True Guru, God Incarnate. O Nanak, by Guru's Grace, they
        are redeemed; their egos are burnt away through the Word of the
        Shabad.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord's Name is my immortal,
        unfathomable, imperishable Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny.
        I serve the Lord's Name, I worship the Lord's Name,
        and my soul is imbued with the Lord's Name. I know of no
        other as great as the Lord's Name; the Lord's Name shall
        deliver me in the end. The Generous Guru has given me the Lord's
        Name; blessed, blessed are the Guru's mother and father.
        I ever bow in humble reverence to my True Guru; meeting Him, I
        have come to know the Lord's Name.  || 16 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  One who does not serve the Guru as Gurmukh, who does not
        love the Lord's Name, and who does not savor the taste of
        the Shabad, shall die, and be reborn, over and over again. The
        blind, self-willed manmukh does not think of the Lord; why did
        he even come into the world? O Nanak, that Gurmukh, upon whom
        the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, crosses over the world-ocean.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Only the Guru is awake; the rest of the
        world is asleep in emotional attachment and desire. Those who
        serve the True Guru and remain wakeful, are imbued with the True
        Name, the treasure of virtue. </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not think of the Lord; they
        are ruined through birth and death. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs meditate
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; this is their destiny, pre-ordained
        by the Primal Lord God.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord's Name
        is my food; eating the thirty-six varieties of it, I am satisfied
        and satiated. The Lord's Name is my clothing; wearing it,
        I shall never be naked again, and my desire to wear other clothing
        is gone. The Lord's Name is my business, the Lord's
        Name is my commerce; the True Guru has blessed me with its use.
        I record the account of the Lord's Name, and I shall not
        be subject to death again. Only a few, as Gurmukh, meditate on
        the Lord's Name; they are blessed by the Lord, and receive
        their pre-ordained destiny.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL: 
        The world is blind and ignorant; in the love of duality, it engages
        in actions. But those actions which are performed in the love
        of duality, cause only pain to the body. By Guru's Grace,
        peace wells up, when one acts according to the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. He acts according to the True Word of the Guru's
        Bani; night and day, he meditates on the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord. O Nanak, as the Lord Himself engages him, so is he engaged;
        no one has any say in this matter.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Within
        the home of my own being, is the everlasting treasure of the Naam;
        it is a treasure house, overflowing with devotion. The True Guru
        is the Giver of the life of the soul; the Great Giver lives forever.
        Night and day, I continually sing the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praise, through the Infinite Word of the Guru's Shabad. I
        recite continually the Guru's Shabads, which have been effective
        throughout the ages. This mind ever abides in peace, dealing in
        peace and poise. Deep within me is the Guru's Wisdom, the
        Lord's jewel, the Bringer of liberation. O Nanak, one who
        is blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace obtains this, and
        is judged to be True in the Court of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Blessed, blessed is that Sikh of the Guru, who goes and falls
        at the Feet of the True Guru. Blessed, blessed is that Sikh of
        the Guru, who with his mouth, utters the Name of the Lord. Blessed,
        blessed is that Sikh of the Guru, whose mind, upon hearing the
        Lord's Name, becomes blissful. Blessed, blessed is that Sikh
        of the Guru, who serves the True Guru, and so obtains the Lord's
        Name. I bow forever in deepest respect to that Sikh of the Guru,
        who walks in the Way of the Guru.  || 18 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:
        No one has ever found the Lord through stubborn-mindedness. All
        have grown weary of performing such actions. Through their stubborn-mindedness,
        and by wearing their disguises, they are deluded; they suffer
        in pain from the love of duality. Riches and the supernatural
        spiritual powers of the Siddhas are all emotional attachments;
        through them, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, does not come to
        dwell in the mind. Serving the Guru, the mind becomes immaculately
        pure, and the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled. The
        jewel of the Naam is revealed in the home of one's own being;
        O Nanak, one merges in celestial bliss.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL: </p>

      </p>
      <p> One who does not savor the taste of the Shabad, who does not love
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and who speaks insipid words with
        his tongue, is ruined, again and again. O Nanak, he acts according
        to the karma of his past actions, which no one can erase.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  Blessed, blessed is the True Being, my True Guru;
        meeting Him, I have found peace. Blessed, blessed is the True
        Being, my True Guru; meeting Him, I have attained the Lord's
        devotional worship. Blessed, blessed is the Lord's devotee,
        my True Guru; serving Him, I have come to enshrine love for the
        Name of the Lord. Blessed, blessed is the Knower of the Lord,
        my True Guru; He has taught me to look upon friend and foe alike.
        Blessed, blessed is the True Guru, my best friend; He has led
        me to embrace love for the Name of the Lord.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,
        FIRST MEHL:  The soul-bride is at home, while the Husband Lord
        is away; she cherishes His memory, and mourns His absence. She
        shall meet Him without delay, if she rids herself of duality.
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, false is the speech of one who
        acts without loving the Lord. He judges things to be good, only
        as long as the Lord gives and he receives.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        The Lord, who created the creatures, also protects them. I have
        tasted the food of Ambrosial Nectar, the True Name. I am satisfied
        and satiated, and my hunger is appeased. The One Lord is pervading
        in all, but rare are those who realize this. Servant Nanak is
        enraptured, in the Protection of God.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  All the living beings of the world behold the True Guru.
        One is not liberated by merely seeing Him, unless one contemplates
        the Word of His Shabad. The filth of ego is not removed, and he
        does not enshrine love for the Naam. The Lord forgives some, and
        unites them with Himself; they forsake their duality and sinful
        ways. O Nanak, some behold the Blessed Vision of the True Guru's
        Darshan, with love and affection; conquering their ego, they meet
        with the Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The foolish, blind clown
        does not serve the True Guru. In love with duality, he endures
        terrible suffering, and burning, he cries out in pain. He forgets
        the Guru, for the sake of mere objects, but they will not come
        to his rescue in the end. Through the Guru's Instructions,
        Nanak has found peace; the Forgiving Lord has forgiven him.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  You Yourself, all by Yourself, are the Creator
        of all. If there were any other, then I would speak of another.
        The Lord Himself speaks, and causes us to speak; He Himself is
        pervading the water and the land. The Lord Himself destroys, and
        the Lord Himself saves. O mind, seek and remain in the Lord's
        Sanctuary. Other than the Lord, no one can kill or rejuvenate.
        O mind, do not be anxious  -  remain fearless. While standing,
        sitting, and sleeping, forever and ever, meditate on the Lord's
        Name; O servant Nanak, as Gurmukh, you shall attain the Lord.
