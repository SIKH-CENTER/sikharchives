      <p> O Nanak, she revels in joy, imbued with His Love; she focuses
        her consciousness on the Lord.  || 3 ||   The mind of the soul
        bride is very happy, when she meets her Friend, her Beloved Lord.
        Through the Guru's Teachings, her mind becomes immaculate;
        she enshrines the Lord within her heart. Keeping the Lord enshrined
        within her heart, her affairs are arranged and resolved; through
        the Guru's Teachings, she knows her Lord. My Beloved has
        enticed my mind; I have obtained the Lord, the Architect of Destiny.
        Serving the True Guru, she finds lasting peace; the Lord, the
        Destroyer of pride, dwells in her mind. O Nanak, she merges with
        her Guru, embellished and adorned with the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 4 || 5 || 6 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The song of
        joy is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; contemplate it, through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The mind and body of the
        Gurmukh is drenched with the Lord, the Beloved Lord. Through the
        Name of the Beloved Lord, all one's ancestors and generations
        are redeemed; chant the Lord's Name with your mouth. Comings
        and goings cease, peace is obtained, and in the home of the heart,
        one's awareness is absorbed in the unstruck melody of the
        sound current. I have found the One and only Lord, Har, Har. The
        Lord God has showered His Mercy upon Nanak. The song of joy is
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, contemplate it.  || 1 ||   I am lowly, and God is lofty
        and exalted. How will I ever meet Him? The Guru has very mercifully
        blessed me and united me with the Lord; through the Shabad, the
        Word of the Lord, I am lovingly embellished. Merging in the Word
        of the Shabad, I am lovingly embellished; my ego is eradicated,
        and I revel in joyous love. My bed is so comfortable, since I
        became pleasing to God; I am absorbed in the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har. O Nanak, that soul bride is so very blessed, who walks
        in harmony with the True Guru's Will. I am lowly, and God
        is lofty and exalted. How will I ever meet Him?  || 2 ||   In
        each and every heart, and deep within all, is the One Lord, the
        Husband Lord of all. God dwells far away from some, while for
        others, He is the Support of the mind. For some, the Creator Lord
        is the Support of the mind; He is obtained by great good fortune,
        through the Guru. The One Lord God, the Master, is in each and
        every heart; the Gurmukh sees the unseen. The mind is satisfied,
        in natural ecstasy, O Nanak, contemplating God. In each and every
        heart, and deep within all, is the One Lord, the Husband Lord
        of all.  || 3 ||   Those who serve the Guru, the True Guru, the
        Giver, merge in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. O Lord, please
        bless me with the dust of the feet of the Perfect Guru, so that
        I, a sinner, may be liberated. Even sinners are liberated, by
        eradicating their egotism; they obtain a home within their own
        heart. With clear unerstanding, the night of their lives passes
        peacefully; through the Guru's Teachings, the Naam is revealed
        to them. Through the Lord, Har, Har, I am in ecstasy, day and
        night. O Nanak, the Lord seems sweet. Those who serve the Guru,
        the True Guru, the Giver, merge in the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har.  || 4 || 6 || 7 || 5 || 7 || 12 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">If only I could meet the True Guru, the Primal
        Being. Discarding my faults and sins, I would chant the Lord's
        Glorious Praises. I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har. Continuously, continually, I chant the Word of the Guru's
        Bani. Gurbani always seems so sweet; I have eradicated the sinful
        residues from within. The disease of egotism is gone, fear has
        left, and I am absorbed in celestial peace. Through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad, the bed of my body has become cozy and
        beautiful, and I enjoy the essence of spiritual wisdom. Night
        and day, I continually enjoy peace and pleasure. O Nanak, this
        is my pre-ordained destiny.  || 1 ||   The soul-bride is lovingly
        embellished with truth and contentment; her Father, the Guru,
        has come to engage her in marriage to her Husband Lord. Joining
        with the humble Saints, I sing Gurbani. Singing the Guru's
        Bani, I have obtained the supreme status; meeting with the Saints,
        the self-elect, I am blessed and adorned. Anger and attachment
        have left my body and run away; I have eradicated hypocrisy and
        doubt. The pain of egotism is gone, and I have found peace; my
        body has become healthy and free of disease. By Guru's
        Grace, O Nanak, I have realized God, the ocean of virtue.  ||
        2 ||   The self-willed manmukh is separated, far away from God;
        she does not obtain the Mansion of His Presence, and she burns.
        Egotism and falsehood are deep within her; deluded by falsehood,
        she deals only in falsehood. Practicing fraud and falsehood, she
        suffers terrible pain; without the True Guru, she does not find
        the way. The foolish soul-bride wanders along dismal pathways;
        each and every moment, she is bumped and pushed. God, the Great
        Giver, shows His Mercy, and leads her to meet the True Guru, the
        Primal Being. Those beings who have been separated for countless
        incarnations, O Nanak, are reunited with the Lord, with intuitive
        ease.  || 3 ||   Calculating the most auspicious moment, the Lord
        comes into the bride's home; her heart is filled with ecstasy.
        The Pandits and astrologers have come, to sit and consult the
        almanacs. They have consulted the almanacs, and the bride's
        mind vibrates with bliss, when she hears that her Friend is coming
        into the home of her heart. The virtuous and wise men sat down
        and decided to perform the marriage immediately. She has found
        her Husband, the Inaccessible, Unfathomable Primal Lord, who is
        forever young; He is her Best Friend from her earliest childhood.
        O Nanak, he has mercifully united the bride with Himself. She
        shall never be separated again.  || 4 || 1 || <a name="lawan" id="lawan">SOOHEE</a>,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  In the first round of the marriage ceremony, the Lord sets
        out His Instructions for performing the daily duties of married
        life. Instead of the hymns of the Vedas to Brahma, embrace the
        righteous conduct of Dharma, and renounce sinful actions. Meditate
        on the Lord's Name; embrace and enshrine the contemplative
        remembrance of the Naam. Worship and adore the Guru, the Perfect
        True Guru, and all your sinful residues shall be dispelled. <br>

      <p> By great good fortune, celestial bliss is attained, and the Lord,
        Har, Har, seems sweet to the mind. Servant Nanak proclaims that,
        in this, the first round of the marriage ceremony, the marriage
        ceremony has begun.  || 1 ||   In the second round of the marriage
        ceremony, the Lord leads you to meet the True Guru, the Primal
        Being. With the Fear of God, the Fearless Lord in the mind, the
        filth of egotism is eradicated. In the Fear of God, the Immaculate
        Lord, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and behold the Lord's
        Presence before you. The Lord, the Supreme Soul, is the Lord and
        Master of the Universe; He is pervading and permeating everywhere,
        fully filling all spaces. Deep within, and outside as well, there
        is only the One Lord God. Meeting together, the humble servants
        of the Lord sing the songs of joy. Servant Nanak proclaims that,
        in this, the second round of the marriage ceremony, the unstruck
        sound current of the Shabad resounds.  || 2 ||   In the third
        round of the marriage ceremony, the mind is filled with Divine
        Love. Meeting with the humble Saints of the Lord, I have found
        the Lord, by great good fortune. I have found the Immaculate Lord,
        and I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. I speak the Word
        of the Lord's Bani. By great good fortune, I have found
        the humble Saints, and I speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.
        The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, vibrates and resounds within
        my heart; meditating on the Lord, I have realized the destiny
        inscribed upon my forehead. Servant Nanak proclaims that, in this,
        the third round of the marriage ceremony, the mind is filled with
        Divine Love for the Lord.  || 3 ||   In the fourth round of the
        marriage ceremony, my mind has become peaceful; I have found the
        Lord. As Gurmukh, I have met Him, with intuitive ease; the Lord
        seems so sweet to my mind and body. The Lord seems so sweet; I
        am pleasing to my God. Night and day, I lovingly focus my consciousness
        on the Lord. I have obtained my Lord and Master, the fruit of
        my mind's desires. The Lord's Name resounds and
        resonates. The Lord God, my Lord and Master, blends with His bride,
        and her heart blossoms forth in the Naam. Servant Nanak proclaims
        that, in this, the fourth round of the marriage ceremony, we have
        found the Eternal Lord God.  || 4 || 2 || <br>

        to my God, who meets them with natural ease. Night and day, they
        enjoy enjoyments, and they sleep in peace; they remain lovingly
        absorbed in the Word of the Shabad. By great good fortune, one
        obtains the Perfect Guru; night and day, meditate on the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. In absolute ease and poise, one meets the
        Life of the World. O Nanak, one is absorbed in the state of absolute
        absorption.  || 1 ||   Joining the Society of the Saints, I bathe
        in the Immaculate Pool of the Lord. Bathing in these Immaculate
        Waters, my filth is removed, and my body is purified and sanctified.
        The filth of intellectual evil-mindedness is removed, doubt is
        gone, and the pain of egotism is dispelled. By God's Grace,

        loves the Name of the Lord; deep within, she contemplates the
        jewel of the Naam. Those who love the Lord's Name are emancipated
        through the Word of the Shabad. The darkness of ignorance is dispelled.
        Spiritual wisdom burns brilliantly, illuminating the heart; their
        homes and temples are embellished and blessed. I have made my
        body and mind into adornments, and dedicated them to the True
        Lord God, pleasing Him. Whatever God says, I gladly do. O Nanak,
        I have merged into the fiber of His Being.  || 3 ||   The Lord
        God has arranged the marriage ceremony; He has come to marry the
        Gurmukh. He has come to marry the Gurmukh, who has found the Lord.
        That bride is very dear to her Lord. The humble Saints join together
        and sing the songs of joy; the Dear Lord Himself has adorned the
        soul-bride. The angels and mortal beings, the heavenly heralds
        and celestial singers, have come together and formed a wondrous
        wedding party. O Nanak, I have found my True Lord God, who never

        Gurmukh; within the home of our own heart, the Shabad vibrates
        and resonates. The many melodies of the Shabad are Yours, O Lord
        God; O Creator Lord, You are everywhere. Day and night, I chant
        His Praises forever, lovingly focusing on the True Word of the
        Shabad. Night and day, I remain intuitively attuned to the Lord's
        Love; in my heart, I worship the Lord's Name. O Nanak,
        as Gurmukh, I have realized the One Lord; I do not know any other.
        || 1 ||   He is contained amongst all; He is God, the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts. One who meditates and dwells upon God,
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, knows that God,
        my Lord and Master, is pervading everywhere. God, my Lord and
        Master, is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; He pervades
        and permeates each and every heart. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, Truth is obtained, and then, one merges in celestial
        bliss. There is no other than Him. I sing His Praises with intuitive
        ease. If it pleases God, He shall unite me with Himself. O Nanak,
        through the Shabad, God is known; meditate on the Naam, day and
        night.  || 2 ||   This world is treacherous and impassable; the
        self-willed manmukh cannot cross over. Within him is egotism,
        self-conceit, sexual desire, anger and cleverness. Within him
        is cleverness; he is not approved, and his life is uselessly wasted
        and lost. On the Path of Death, he suffers in pain, and must endure
        abuse; in the end, he departs regretfully. Without the Name, he
        has no friends, no children, family or relatives. O Nanak, the
        wealth of Maya, attachment and ostentatious shows - none
        of them shall go along with him to the world hereafter.  || 3
        ||   I ask my True Guru, the Giver, how to cross over the treacherous
        and difficult world-ocean. Walk in harmony with the True Guru's
        Will, and remain dead while yet alive. <br>

      <p> Remaining dead while yet alive, cross over the terrifying world-ocean;
        as Gurmukh, merge in the Naam. One obtains the Perfect Primal
        Lord, by great good fortune, lovingly focusing on the True Name.
        The intellect is enlightened, and the mind is satisfied, through
        the glory of the Lord's Name. O Nanak, God is found, merging
        in the Shabad, and one's light blends into the Light.

        Lord. By great good fortune, servant Nanak has found the Lord;
        he blossoms forth in the Naam.  || 1 ||   I have met my Beloved
        Friend, the Guru, who has shown me the Path to the Lord. Come
        home - I have been separated from You for so long! Please,
        let me merge with You, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        O my Lord God. Without You, I am so sad; like a fish out of water,
        I shall die. The very fortunate ones meditate on the Lord; servant
        Nanak merges into the Naam.  || 2 ||   The mind runs around in
        the ten directions; the self-willed manmukh wanders around, deluded
        by doubt. In his mind, he continually conjures up hopes; his mind
        is gripped by hunger and thirst. There is an infinite treasure
        buried within the mind, but still, he goes out, searching for
        poison. O servant Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord;
        without the Name, he rots away, and wastes away to death.  ||
        3 ||   Finding the beautiful and fascinating Guru, I have conquered
        my mind, through the Bani, the Word of my Beloved Lord. My heart
        has forgotten its common sense and wisdom; my mind has forgotten
        its hopes and cares. Deep within my self, I feel the pains of
        divine love. Beholding the Guru, my mind is comforted and consoled.
        Awaken my good destiny, O God - please, come and meet me!
        Each and every instant, servant Nanak is a sacrifice to You. 
        || 4 || 1 || 5 ||   SOOHEE,  CHHANT,  FOURTH MEHL:  Eradicate
        the poison of egotism, O human being; it is holding you back from
        meeting your Lord God. This golden-colored body has been disfigured
        and ruined by egotism. Attachment to Maya is total darkness; this
        foolish, self-willed manmukh is attached to it. O servant Nanak,
        the Gurmukh is saved; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        he is released from egotism.  || 1 ||   Overcome and subdue this
        mind; your mind wanders around continually, like a falcon. The
        mortal's life-night passes painfully, in constant hope
        and desire. I have found the Guru, O humble Saints; my mind's
        hopes are fulfilled, chanting the Lord's Name. Please bless
        servant Nanak, O God, with such understanding, that abandoning
        false hopes, he may always sleep in peace.  || 2 ||   The bride
        hopes in her mind, that her Sovereign Lord God will come to her
        bed. <br>

      <p> My Lord and Master is infinitely compassionate; O Sovereign Lord,
        be merciful, and merge me into Yourself. My mind and body long
        to behold the Guru's face. O Sovereign Lord, I have spread
        out my bed of loving faith. O servant Nanak, when the bride pleases
        her Lord God, her Sovereign Lord meets her with natural ease.
        || 3 ||   My Lord God, my Sovereign Lord, is on the one bed.
        The Guru has shown me how to meet my Lord. My mind and body are
        filled with love and affection for my Sovereign Lord. In His Mercy,
        the Guru has united me with Him. I am a sacrifice to my Guru,
        O my Sovereign Lord; I surrender my soul to the True Guru. When
        the Guru is totally pleased, O servant Nanak, he unites the soul
        with the Lord, the Sovereign Lord.  || 4 || 2 || 6 || 18 || <br>

        not worth even half a shell. Only the Name of the Lord of the
        Universe is permanent. You shall take on the deep and lasting
        red color of the poppy, contemplating the sweet Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. You remain intoxicated with false emotional attachment;
        you are attached to falsehood. Nanak, meek and humble, seeks the

        the Lord, and remain attached to God's Feet. Dedicate and
        surrender this mind to the Lord, and have no doubts; as Gurmukh,
        renounce your great pride. O Nanak, the Lord carries the meek
        and humble devotees across the terrifying world-ocean. What Glorious
        Virtues of Your should I chant and recite?  || 2 ||   Listen,
        madman: why do you harbor false pride? Listen, madman: all your
        egotism and pride shall be overcome. What you think is permanent,
        shall all pass away. Pride is false, so become the slave of God's
        Saints. Remain dead while still alive, and you shall cross over
        the terrifying world-ocean, if it is your pre-ordained destiny.
        One whom the Lord causes to meditate intuitively, serves the Guru,

        forever a sacrifice to Him.  || 3 ||   Listen, madman: do not
        think that you have found God. Listen, madman: be the dust under
        the feet of those who meditate on God. Those who meditate on God
        find peace. By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of their
        Darshan is obtained. Be humble, and be forever a sacrifice, and
        your self-conceit shall be totally eradicated. One who has found
        God is pure, with blessed destiny. I would sell myself to him.
        Nanak, the meek and humble, seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord, the
        ocean of peace. Make him Your own, and preserve his honor.  ||

        everything is in His Home. I am a sacrifice to the Lord. My Father
        is absolutely all-powerful. God is the Doer, the Cause of causes.
        Remembering Him in meditation, pain does not touch me; thus I
        cross over the terrifying world-ocean. In the beginning, and throughout
        the ages, He is the Protector of His devotees. Praising Him continually,
        I live. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the sweetest
        and most sublime essence. Night and day, I drink it in with my
        mind and body.  || 1 ||   The Lord unites me with Himself; how
        could I feel any separation? I am a sacrifice to the Lord. One
        who has Your Support lives forever and ever. I am a sacrifice
        to the Lord. I take my support from You alone, O True Creator
        Lord. No one lacks this Support; such is my God. Meeting with
        the humble Saints, I sing the songs of joy; day and night, I place
        my hopes in You. I have obtained the Blessed Vision, the Darshan
        of the Perfect Guru. Nanak is forever a sacrifice.  || 2 ||  
        Contemplating, dwelling upon the Lord's true home, I receive
        honor, greatness and truth. I am a sacrifice to the Lord. Meeting
        the Merciful True Guru, I sing the Praises of the Imperishable
        Lord. I am a sacrifice to the Lord. Sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord of the Universe, continually, continuously; He is
        the Beloved Master of the breath of life. Good times have come;
        the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, has met me, and hugged
        me close in His Embrace. The musical instruments of truth and
        contentment vibrate, and the unstruck melody of the sound current
        resounds. Hearing this, all my fears have been dispelled; O Nanak,
        God is the Primal Being, the Creator Lord.  || 3 ||   The essence
        of spiritual wisdom has welled up; in this world, and the next,
        the One Lord is pervading. I am a sacrifice to the Lord. When
        God meets the God within the self, no one can separate them. I
        am a sacrifice to the Lord. I gaze upon the Wondrous Lord, and
        listen to the Wondrous Lord; the Wondrous Lord has come into my
        vision. The Perfect Lord and Master is pervading the water, the
        land and the sky, in each and every heart. I have merged again
        into the One from whom I originated. The value of this cannot
        be described. Nanak meditates on Him.  || 4 || 2 || <br>

        meditating in remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har; all wishes shall
        be fulfilled. Even the worst corruption is taken away; peace wells
        up, and the unstruck celestial harmony vibrates and resounds.
        All the fruits of the mind's desires are obtained; His
        creative power is infinitely valuable. Says Nanak, please be Merciful
        to me, God, that my mind may follow Your Path forever.  || 3 ||
        This opportunity, this glorious greatness, this blessing and
        wealth, come by great good fortune. These pleasures, these delightful
        enjoyments, come when my mind is attached to the Lord's
        Feet. My mind is attached to God's Feet; I seek His Sanctuary.
        He is the Creator, the Cause of causes, the Cherisher of the world.
        Everything is Yours; You are my God, O my Lord and Master, Merciful
        to the meek. I am worthless, O my Beloved, ocean of peace. In
        the Saints' Congregation, my mind is awakened. Says Nanak,
        God has been Merciful to me; my mind is attached to His Lotus
        Feet.  || 4 || 3 || 6 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating on
        the Lord, the Lord's Temple has been built; the Saints
        and devotees sing the Lord's Glorious Praises. Meditating,
        meditating in remembrance of God, their Lord and Master, they
        discard and renounce all their sins. Singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, the supreme status is obtained. The Word of God's
        Bani is sublime and exalted. God's Sermon is so very sweet.
        It brings celestial peace. It is to speak the Unspoken Speech.
        The time and the moment were auspicious, blessed and true, when
        the eternal foundation of this Temple was placed. O servant Nanak,
        God has been kind and compassionate; with all His powers, He has
        blessed me.  || 1 ||   The sounds of ecstasy vibrate through me
        continuously. I have enshrined the Supreme Lord within my mind.
        As Gurmukh, my lifestyle is excellent and true; my false hopes
        and doubts are dispelled. The Gurmukh chants the Bani of the unstruck
        melody; hearing it, listening to it, my mind and body are rejuvenated.
        All pleasures are obtained, by that one whom God makes His Own.
        Within the home of the heart are the nine treasures, filled to
        overflowing. He has fallen in love with the Lord's Name.
        Servant Nanak shall never forget God; his destiny is perfectly
        fulfilled.  || 2 ||   God, the King, has given me shade under
        His canopy, and the fire of desire has been totally extinguished.
        The home of sorrow and sin has been demolished, and all affairs
        have been resolved. <br>

      <p> When the Lord God so commands, misfortune is averted; true righteousness,
        Dharma and charity flourish. Meditate forever on your God, when
        you sleep and sit and stand. The Lord and Master is the treasure
        of virtue, the ocean of peace; He pervades the water, the land
        and the sky. Servant Nanak has entered God's Sanctuary;
        there is no other than Him.  || 3 ||   My home is made, the garden
        and pool are made, and my Sovereign Lord God has met me. My mind
        is adorned, and my friends rejoice; I sing the songs of joy, and
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Singing the Glorious Praises
        of the True Lord God, all desires are fulfilled. Those who are
        attached to the Guru's Feet are always awake and aware;
        His Praises resound and resonate through their minds. My Lord
        and Master, the bringer of peace, has blessed me with His Grace;
        He has arranged this world, and the world hereafter for me. Prays
        Nanak, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord forever; He is the
        Support of the body and soul.  || 4 || 4 || 7 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The terrifying world-ocean, the terrifying world-ocean
        - I have crossed over it, meditating on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har. I worship and adore the Lord's Feet,
        the boat to carry me across. Meeting the True Guru, I am carried
        over. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I cross over,
        and I shall not die again; my comings and goings are ended. Whatever
        He does, I accept as good, and my mind merges in celestial peace.
        Neither pain, nor hunger, nor disease afflicts me. I have found
        the Sanctuary of the Lord, the ocean of peace. Meditating, meditating
        in remembrance on the Lord, Nanak is imbued with His Love; his
        mind's anxieties are dispelled.  || 1 ||   The humble Saints
        have implanted the Lord's Mantra within me, and the Lord,
        my Best Friend, has come under my power. I have dedicated my mind
        to my Lord and Master, and offered it to Him, and He has blessed
        me with everything. He has made me His hand-maiden and slave;
        my sadness is dispelled, and in the Lord's Temple, I have
        found stability. My joy and bliss are in meditating on my True
        God; I shall never be separated from Him again. She alone is very
        fortunate, and a true soul-bride, who contemplates the Glorious
        Vision of the Lord's Name. Says Nanak, I am imbued with
        His Love, drenched in the supreme, sublime essence of His Love.
        || 2 ||   I am in continual bliss and ecstasy, O my companions;
        I sing the songs of joy forever. God Himself has embellished her,
        and she has become His virtuous soul-bride. With natural ease,
        He has become Merciful to her. He does not consider her merits
        or demerits. He hugs His humble servants close in His Loving Embrace;
        they enshrine the Lord's Name in their hearts. Everyone
        is engrossed in arrogant pride, attachment and intoxication; in
        His Mercy, He has freed me of them. Says Nanak, I have crossed
        over the terrifying world-ocean, and all my affairs are perfectly
        resolved.  || 3 ||   Continually sing the Glorious Praises of
        the World-Lord, O my companions; all your wishes shall be granted.
        Life becomes fruitful, meeting with the Holy Saints, and meditating
        on the One God, the Creator of the Universe. Chant, and meditate
        on the One God, who permeates and pervades the many beings of
        the whole Universe. God created it, and God spreads through it
        everywhere. Everywhere I look, I see God. The Perfect Lord is
        perfectly pervading and permeating the water, the land and the
        sky; there is no place without Him. <br>
