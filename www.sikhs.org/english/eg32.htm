        <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD. </b>
        <p> <b>TRUTH IS THE NAME. </b> </p>
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  NO FEAR.  NO HATRED. </p>
        <p> IMAGE OF THE UNDYING.  BEYOND BIRTH.  SELF-EXISTENT. </p>
        <p> BY GURU'S GRACE: </p>
        <p> RAAG  AASAA,  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  SO DAR ~ THAT GATE: </p>
      </center>
      <p> What is that Gate, and what is that Home, in which You sit and
        take care of all? Countless musical instruments of so many various
        kinds vibrate there for You; so many are the musicians there for
        You. There are so many Ragas there for You, along with their accompanying
        harmonies; so many minstrels sing to You. The winds sing to You,
        as do water and fire; the Righteous Judge of Dharma sings at Your
        Door. Chitar and Gupat, the recording angels of the conscious
        and the subconscious, sing to You; they know, and they write,
        and on the basis of what they write, the Lord of Dharma passes
        judgement. Shiva and Brahma and the Goddess Parvaati, so beautiful
        and ever adorned by You, sing to You. The Indras, seated upon
        their celestial thrones, with the deities at Your Gate, sing to
        You. The Siddhas in Samaadhi sing to You, and the Holy Saints,
        in their contemplative meditation, sing to You. The celibates,
        the truthful and the patient beings sing to You, and the mighty
        warriors sing to You. The scholarly Pandits sing to You, along
        with the holy Rishis and the readers of the Vedas throughout the
        ages. The Mohinis, the heavenly beauties who entice the heart
        in paradise, in this world and in the nether regions, sing to
        You. The fourteen priceless jewels created by You, and the sixty-eight
        holy places of pilgrimage, sing to You. The mighty warriors and
        the divine heroes sing to You, and the four sources of creation
        sing to You. The continents, the worlds and the solar systems,
        created and installed by Your Hand, sing to You. They alone sing
        to You, who are pleasing to Your Will, and who are imbued with
        the nectar of Your devotional worship. So many others sing to
        You, they do not come into my mind; how can Nanak think of them?
        That Lord and Master  -  He is True, forever True; He is True,
        and True is His Name. He who created the creation is True, and
        He shall always be True; He shall not depart, even when when the
        creation departs. He created the world of Maya with its various
        colors and species. Having created the creation, He Himself watches
        over it, as it pleases His Greatness. Whatever pleases Him, that
        is what He does. </p>

      <p> No one can issue any commands to Him. He is the King, the King
        of Kings, the Emperor of Kings! Nanak lives in surrender to His
        Will.  || 1 || 1 ||   AASAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  That Lord is Immaculate;
        the Lord God is Immaculate. The Lord is Unapproachable, Unfathomable
        and Incomparable. All meditate, all meditate on You, O Dear Lord,
        O True Creator. All beings are Yours; You are the Giver of all
        beings. So meditate on the Lord, O Saints; He is the One who takes
        away all pain. The Lord Himself is the Master, and He Himself
        is His own servant. O Nanak, how insignificant are mortal beings!
        || 1 ||   You are totally pervading within each and every heart;
        O Lord, You are the One Primal Being, All-permeating. Some are
        givers, and some are beggars; all of this is Your wondrous play!
        You Yourself are the Giver, and You Yourself are the Enjoyer.
        I know of no other than You. You are the Supreme Lord God, Infinite
        and Eternal; what Glorious Praises of Yours should I speak and
        chant? Unto those who serve, unto those who serve You, slave Nanak
        is a sacrifice.  || 2 ||   Those who meditate on the Lord, those
        who meditate on You, O Dear Lord, those humble beings dwell in
        peace in this world. They are liberated, they are liberated, who
        meditate on the Lord; the noose of Death is cut away from them.
        Those who meditate on the Fearless One, on the Fearless Lord,
        all their fears are dispelled. Those who have served, those who
        have served my Dear Lord, are absorbed into the Being of the Lord,
        Har, Har. Blessed are they, blessed are they, who have meditated
        on the Dear Lord; slave Nanak is a sacrifice to them.  || 3 ||
        Devotion to You, devotion to You, is a treasure, overflowing,
        infinite and endless. Your devotees, Your devotees praise You,
        O Dear Lord, in many and various ways. For You, so many, for You,
        so very many, O Dear Lord, perform worship and adoration; they
        practice penance and endlessly chant in meditation. For You, many
        -  for You, so very many read the various Simritees and Shaastras;
        they perform religious rituals and the six ceremonies. Those devotees,
        those devotees are good, O servant Nanak, who are pleasing to
        my Lord God.  || 4 ||   You are the Primal Being, the Unrivalled
        Creator Lord; there is no other as Great as You. You are the One,
        age after age; forever and ever, You are One and the same. You
        are the Eternal, Unchanging Creator. Whatever pleases You comes
        to pass. Whatever You Yourself do, happens. You Yourself created
        the entire Universe, and having done so, You Yourself shall destroy
        it all. Servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Creator,
        the Knower of all.  || 5 || 1 || 2 || </p>

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> RAAG AASAA,  FIRST MEHL,  CHAUPADAY,  SECOND HOUSE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Hearing, everyone calls You Great, but only one who has seen You,
        knows just how Great You are. </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>
          <b><a name="p349" id="p349">Page 349</a></b>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> No one can measure Your Worth, or describe You. Those who describe
        You, remain absorbed in You. || 1 ||   O my Great Lord and Master
        of Unfathomable Depth, You are the Ocean of Excellence. No one
        knows the greatness of Your expanse.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All
        the contemplators met together and practiced contemplation; all
        the appraisers met together and tried to appraise You. The theologians,
        the meditators and the teachers of teachers could not express
        even an iota of Your Greatness.  || 2 ||   All Truth, all austerities,
        all goodness, and the greatness of the Siddhas, the beings of
        perfect spiritual powers  -  without You, none has attained
        such spiritual powers. They are obtained by Your Grace; their
        flow cannot be blocked.  || 3 ||   What can the helpless speaker
        do? Your bounties are overflowing with Your Praises. And the one,
        unto whom You give  -  why should he think of any other? O
        Nanak, the True Lord is the Embellisher.  || 4 || 1 ||   AASAA,
        FIRST MEHL:  Chanting the Name, I live; forgetting it, I die.
        It is so difficult to chant the True Name. If someone feels hunger
        for the True Name, then that hunger shall consume his pains. 
        || 1 ||   So how could I ever forget Him, O my Mother? True is
        the Master, and True is His Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   People
        have grown weary of trying to appraise the greatness of the True
        Name, but they have not been able to appraise even an iota of
        it. Even if they were all to meet together and recount them, You
        would not be made any greater or lesser.  || 2 ||   He does not
        die  -  there is no reason to mourn. He continues to give,
        but His Provisions are never exhausted. This Glorious Virtue is
        His alone  -  no one else is like Him; there has never been
        anyone like Him, and there never shall be.  || 3 ||   As Great
        as You Yourself are, so Great are Your Gifts. It is You who created
        day and night as well. Those who forget their Lord and Master
        are vile and despicable. O Nanak, without the Name, people are
        wretched outcasts.  || 4 || 2 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  If a beggar
        cries out at the door, the Master hears it in His Mansion. Whether
        He receives him or pushes him away, it is the Gift of the Lord's
        Greatness.  || 1 ||   Recognize the Lord's Light within all,
        and do not consider social class or status; there are no classes
        or castes in the world hereafter.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself
        acts, and He Himself inspires us to act. He Himself considers
        our complaints. Since You, O Creator Lord, are the Doer, why should
        I submit to the world?  || 2 ||   You Yourself created and You
        Yourself give. You Yourself eliminate evil-mindedness; by Guru's
        Grace, You come to abide in our minds, and then, pain and darkness
        are dispelled from within.  || 3 ||   He Himself infuses love
        for the Truth. Unto others, the Truth is not bestowed.. If He
        bestows it upon someone, says Nanak, then, in the world hereafter,
        that person is not called to account.  || 4 || 3 ||   AASAA, 
        FIRST MEHL:  The urges of the heart are like cymbals and ankle-bells;
        the drum of the world resounds with the beat. Naarad dances to
        the tune of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga; where can the celibates
        and the men of truth place their feet?  || 1 ||   Nanak is a sacrifice
        to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The world is blind; our Lord
        and Master is All-seeing.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The disciple feeds
        on the Guru; out of love for bread, he comes to dwell in his home. </p>

      <p> If one were to live and eat for hundreds of years, that day alone
        would be auspicious, when he recognizes his Lord and Master. 
        || 2 ||   Beholding the sight of the petitioner, compassion is
        not aroused. No one lives without give and take. The king administers
        justice only if his palm is greased. No one is moved by the Name
        of God.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, they are human beings in form and
        name only; by their deeds they are dogs  -  this is the Command
        of the Lord's Court. By Guru's Grace, if one sees himself
        as a guest in this world, then he gains honor in the Court of
        the Lord.  || 4 || 4 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  As much as the
        Shabad is in the mind, so much is Your melody; as much as the
        form of the universe is, so much is Your body, Lord. You Yourself
        are the tongue, and You Yourself are the nose. Do not speak of
        any other, O my mother.  || 1 ||   My Lord and Master is One;
        He is the One and Only; O Siblings of Destiny, He is the One alone.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself kills, and He Himself emancipates;
        He Himself gives and takes. He Himself beholds, and He Himself
        rejoices; He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace.  || 2 ||   Whatever
        He is to do, that is what He is doing. No one else can do anything.
        As He projects Himself, so do we describe Him; this is all Your
        Glorious Greatness, Lord.  || 3 ||   The Dark Age of Kali Yuga
        is the bottle of wine; Maya is the sweet wine, and the intoxicated
        mind continues to drink it in. He Himself assumes all sorts of
        forms; thus poor Nanak speaks.  || 4 || 5 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:
        Make your intellect your instrument, and love your tambourine;
        thus bliss and lasting pleasure shall be produced in your mind.
        This is devotional worship, and this is the practice of penance.
        So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet.  || 1
        ||   Know that the perfect beat is the Praise of the Lord; other
        dances produce only temporary pleasure in the mind.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Play the two cymbals of truth and contentment. Let
        your ankle bells be the lasting Vision of the Lord. Let your harmony
        and music be the elimination of duality. So dance in this love,
        and keep the beat with your feet.  || 2 ||   Let the fear of God
        within your heart and mind be your spinning dance, and keep up,
        whether sitting or standing. To roll around in the dust is to
        know that the body is only ashes. So dance in this love, and keep
        the beat with your feet.  || 3 ||   Keep the company of the disciples,
        the students who love the teachings. As Gurmukh, listen to the
        True Name. O Nanak, chant it, over and over again. So dance in
        this love, and keep the beat with your feet.  || 4 || 6 ||   AASAA,
        FIRST MEHL:  He created the air, and He supports the whole world;
        he bound water and fire together. The blind, ten-headed Raavan
        had his heads cut off, but what greatness was obtained by killing
        him?  || 1 ||   What Glories of Yours can be chanted? You are
        totally pervading everywhere; You love and cherish all.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   You created all beings, and You hold the world
        in Your Hands; what greatness is it to put a ring in the nose
        of the black cobra, as Krishna did? Whose Husband are You? Who
        is Your wife? You are subtly diffused and pervading in all.  ||
        2 ||   Brahma, the bestower of blessings, entered the stem of
        the lotus, with his relatives, to find the extent of the universe.
        Proceeding on, he could not find its limits; what glory was obtained
        by killing Kansa, the king?  || 3 ||   The jewels were produced
        and brought forth by churning the ocean of milk. </p>

      <p> The other gods proclaimed &quot;We are the ones who did this!&quot;
        Says Nanak, by hiding, how can the Lord be hidden? He has given
        each their share, one by one.  || 4 || 7 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:
        The vine of good actions and character has spread out, and it
        bears the fruit of the Lord's Name. The Name has no form
        or outline; it vibrates with the unstruck Sound Current; through
        the Word of the Shabad, the Immaculate Lord is revealed.  || 1
        ||   One can speak on this only when he knows it. He alone drinks
        in the Ambrosial Nectar.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who drink
        it in are enraptured; their bonds and shackles are cut away. When
        one's light blends into the Divine Light, then the desire
        for Maya is ended.  || 2 ||   Among all lights, I behold Your
        Form; all the worlds are Your Maya. Among the tumults and forms,
        He sits in serene detachment; He bestows His Glance of Grace upon
        those who are engrossed in the illusion.  || 3 ||   The Yogi who
        plays on the instrument of the Shabad gains the Blessed Vision
        of the Infinitely Beautiful Lord. He, the Lord, is immersed in
        the Unstruck Shabad of the Word, says Nanak, the humble and meek.
        || 4 || 8 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  My virtue is that I carry
        the load of my words upon my head. The real words are the Words
        of the Creator Lord. How useless are eating, drinking and laughing,
        if the Lord is not cherished in the heart!  || 1 ||   Why should
        someone care for anything else, if throughout his life, he gathers
        in that which is truly worth gathering?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        The intellect of the mind is like a drunken elephant. Whatever
        one utters is totally false, the most false of the false. So what
        face should we put on to offer our prayer, when both virtue and
        vice are close at hand as witnesses?  || 2 ||   As You make us,
        so we become. Without You, there is no other at all. As is the
        understanding which You bestow, so do we receive. As it pleases
        Your Will, so do You lead us.  || 3 ||   The divine crystalline
        harmonies, their consorts, and their celestial families  - 
        from them, the essence of Ambrosial Nectar is produced. O Nanak,
        this is the wealth and property of the Creator Lord. If only this
        essential reality were understood!  || 4 || 9 ||   AASAA,  FIRST
        MEHL:  When by His Grace He came to my home, then my companions
        met together to celebrate my marriage. Beholding this play, my
        mind became blissful; my Husband Lord has come to marry me.  ||
        1 ||   So sing  -  yes, sing the songs of wisdom and and reflection,
        O brides. My spouse, the Life of the world, has come into my home.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When I was married within the Gurdwara,
        the Guru's Gate, I met my Husband Lord, and I came to know
        Him. The Word of His Shabad is pervading the three worlds; when
        my ego was quieted, my mind became happy.  || 2 ||   He Himself
        arranges His own affairs; His affairs cannot be arranged by anyone
        else. By the affair of this marriage, truth, contentment, mercy
        and faith are produced; but how rare is that Gurmukh who understands
        it!  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, that Lord alone is the Husband of all.
        She, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace, becomes the happy
        soul-bride.  || 4 || 10 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  Home and forest
        are the same, for one who dwells in the balance of intuitive peace
        and poise. His evil-mindedness departs, and the Praises of God
        take its place. To chant the True Name with one's mouth is
        the true ladder. </p>

      <p> Serving the True Guru, one finds one's own place within the
        self.  || 1 ||   To conquer the mind is the knowledge of the six
        Shaastras. The Divine Light of the Lord God is perfectly pervading.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Excessive thirst for Maya makes people wear
        all sorts of religious robes. The pain of corruption destroys
        the body's peace. Sexual desire and anger steal the wealth
        of the self within. But by abandoning duality, one is emancipated
        through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   In the Lord's
        Praise and adoration is intuitive peace, poise and bliss. The
        Love of the Lord God is one's family and friends. He Himself
        is the Doer, and He Himself is the Forgiver. My body and mind
        belong to the Lord; my life is at His Command.  || 3 ||   Falsehood
        and corruption cause terrible suffering. All the religious robes
        and social classes look just like dust. Whoever is born, continues
        to come and go. O Nanak, only the Naam and the Lord's Command
        are eternal and everlasting.  || 4 || 11 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:
        In the pool is the one incomparably beautiful lotus. It blossoms
        continually; its form is pure and fragrant. The swans pick up
        the bright jewels. They take on the essence of the All-powerful
        Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||   Whoever is seen, is subject to
        birth and death. In the pool without water, the lotus is not seen.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   How rare are those who know and understand
        this secret. The Vedas continually speak of the three branches.
        One who merges into the knowledge of the Lord as absolute and
        related, serves the True Guru and obtains the supreme status.
        || 2 ||   One who is imbued with the Love of the Lord and dwells
        continually upon Him is liberated. He is the king of kings, and
        blossoms forth continually. That one whom You preserve, by bestowing
        Your Mercy, O Lord, even the sinking stone  -  You float that
        one across.  || 3 ||   Your Light is pervading the three worlds;
        I know that You are permeating the three worlds. When my mind
        turned away from Maya, I came to dwell in my own home. Nanak falls
        at the feet of that person who immerses himself in the Lord's
        Love, and performs devotional worship night and day.  || 4 ||
        12 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  Receiving the True Teachings from
        the Guru, arguments depart. But through excessive cleverness,
        one is only plastered with dirt. The filth of attachment is removed
        by the True Name of the Lord. By Guru's Grace, one remains
        lovingly attached to the Lord.  || 1 ||   He is the Presence Ever-present;
        offer your prayers to Him. Pain and pleasure are in the Hands
        of God, the True Creator.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who practices
        falsehood comes and goes. By speaking and talking, His limits
        cannot be found. Whatever one sees, is not understood. Without
        the Name, satisfaction does not enter into the mind.  || 2 ||
        Whoever is born is afflicted by disease, tortured by the pain
        of egotism and Maya. They alone are saved, who are protected by
        God. Serving the True Guru, they drink in the Amrit, the Ambrosial
        Nectar.  || 3 ||   The unstable mind is restrained by tasting
        this Nectar. Serving the True Guru, one comes to cherish the Ambrosial
        Nectar of the Shabad. Through the True Word of the Shabad, the
        state of liberation is obtained. O Nanak, self-conceit is eradicated
        from within.  || 4 || 13 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  Whatever He
        has done, has proved to be true. The True Guru bestows the Ambrosial
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. With the Naam in the heart, the mind
        is not separated from the Lord. Night and day, one dwells with
        the Beloved.  || 1 ||   O Lord, please keep me in the Protection
        of Your Sanctuary. </p>

      <p> By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the sublime essence of the
        Lord; I have received the wealth of the Naam and the nine treasures.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those whose karma and Dharma  -  whose
        actions and faith  -  are in the True Name of the True Lord
        -  I am forever a sacrifice to them. Those who are imbued
        with the Lord are accepted and respected. In their company, the
        supreme wealth is obtained.  || 2 ||   Blessed is that bride,
        who has obtained the Lord as her Husband. She is imbued with the
        Lord, and she reflects upon the Word of His Shabad. She saves
        herself, and saves her family and friends as well. She serves
        the True Guru, and contemplates the essence of reality.  || 3
        ||   The True Name is my social status and honor. The love of
        the Truth is my karma and Dharma  -  my faith and my actions,
        and my self-control. O Nanak, one who is forgiven by the Lord
        is not called to account. The One Lord erases duality.  || 4 ||
        14 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  Some come, and after they come, they
        go. Some are imbued with the Lord; they remain absorbed in Him.
        Some find no place of rest at all, on the earth or in the sky.
        Those who do not meditate on the Name of the Lord are the most
        unfortunate.  || 1 ||   From the Perfect Guru, the way to salvation
        is obtained. This world is a terrifying ocean of poison; through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord helps us cross over.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those, whom God unites with Himself, cannot
        be crushed by death. The beloved Gurmukhs remain immaculately
        pure, like the lotus in the water, which remains untouched.  ||
        2 ||   Tell me: who should we call good or bad? Behold the Lord
        God; the truth is revealed to the Gurmukh. I speak the Unspoken
        Speech of the Lord, contemplating the Guru's Teachings. I
        join the Sangat, the Guru's Congregation, and I find God's
        limits.  || 3 ||   The Shaastras, the Vedas, the Simritees and
        all their many secrets; bathing at the sixty-eight holy places
        of pilgrimage  -  all this is found by enshrining the sublime
        essence of the Lord in the heart. The Gurmukhs are immaculately
        pure; no filth sticks to them. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, abides in the heart, by the greatest pre-ordained destiny.
        || 4 || 15 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  Bowing down, again and again,
        I fall at the Feet of my Guru; through Him, I have seen the Lord,
        the Divine Self, within. Through contemplation and meditation,
        the Lord dwells within the heart; see this, and understand.  ||
        1 ||   So speak the Lord's Name, which shall emancipate you.
        By Guru's Grace, the jewel of the Lord is found; ignorance
        is dispelled, and the Divine Light shines forth.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   By merely saying it with the tongue, one's bonds are
        not broken, and egotism and doubt do not depart from within. But
        when one meets the True Guru, egotism departs, and then, one realizes
        his destiny.  || 2 ||   The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is sweet
        and dear to His devotees; it is the ocean of peace  -  enshrine
        it within the heart. The Lover of His devotees, the Life of the
        World, the Lord bestows the Guru's Teachings upon the intellect,
        and one is emancipated.  || 3 ||   One who dies fighting against
        his own stubborn mind finds God, and the desires of the mind are
        quieted. O Nanak, if the Life of the World bestows His Mercy,
        one is intuitively attuned to the Love of the Lord.  || 4 || 16
        ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  Unto whom do they speak? Unto whom do
        they preach? Who understands? Let them understand themselves.
        Who do they teach? Through study, they come to realize the Lord's
        Glorious Virtues. </p>

      <p> Through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, they come to dwell
        in contentment.  || 1 ||   Through the Guru's Teachings,
        realize that He is pervading in all bodies; O my soul, vibrate
        on the Profound, Unfathomable Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Loving
        devotion to the Lord brings endless waves of joy and delight.
        One who dwells with the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and
        day, is sanctified. The birth into the world of the faithless
        cynic is totally useless. The humble devotee of the Lord remains
        unattached.  || 2 ||   The body which sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord is sanctified. The soul remains conscious of the Lord,
        absorbed in His Love. The Lord is the Infinite Primal Being, beyond
        the beyond, the priceless jewel. My mind is totally content, imbued
        with my Beloved.  || 3 ||   Those who speak and babble on and
        on, are truly dead. God is not far away  -  O God, You are
        right here. I have seen that the whole world is engrossed in Maya.
        O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, I meditate on the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 17 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL,
        TI-TUKAS:  One is a beggar, living on charity; another is a king,
        absorbed in himself. One receives honor, and another dishonor.
        The Lord destroys and creates; He is enshrined in His meditation.
        There is no other as great as You. So whom should I present to
        You? Who is good enough?  || 1 ||   The Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is my only Support. You are the Great Giver, the Doer, the
        Creator.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have not walked on Your Path;
        I have followed the crooked path. In the Court of the Lord, I
        find no place to sit. I am mentally blind, in the bondage of Maya.
        The wall of my body is breaking down, wearing away, growing weaker.
        You have such high hopes of eating and living  -  your breaths
        and morsels of food are already counted!  || 2 ||   Night and
        day they are blind  -  please, bless them with Your Light.
        They are drowning in the terrifying world-ocean, crying out in
        pain. I am a sacrifice to those who chant, hear and believe in
        the Name. Nanak utters this one prayer; soul and body, all belong
        to You, Lord.  || 3 ||   When You bless me, I chant Your Name.
        Thus I find my seat in the Court of the Lord. When it pleases
        You, evil-mindedness departs, and the jewel of spiritual wisdom
        comes to dwell in the mind. When the Lord bestows His Glance of
        Grace, then one comes to meet the True Guru. Prays Nanak, carry
        us across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 4 || 18 ||   AASAA,
        FIRST MEHL,  PANCH-PADAS:  A cow without milk; a bird without
        wings; a garden without water  -  totally useless! What is
        an emperor, without respect? The chamber of the soul is so dark,
        without the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   How could I ever forget
        You? It would be so painful! I would suffer such pain  -  no,
        I shall not forget You!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The eyes grow blind,
        the tongue does not taste, and the ears do not hear any sound.
        He walks on his feet only when supported by someone else; without
        serving the Lord, such are the fruits of life.  || 2 ||   The
        Word is the tree; the garden of the heart is the farm; tend it,
        and irrigate it with the Lord's Love. All these trees bear
        the fruit of the Name of the One Lord; but without the karma of
        good actions, how can anyone obtain it?  || 3 ||   As many living
        beings are there are, they are all Yours. Without selfless service,
        no one obtains any reward. Pain and pleasure come by Your Will;
        without the Name, the soul does not even exist.  || 4 ||   To
        die in the Teachings is to live. </p>

      <p> Otherwise, what is life? That is not the way. Says Nanak, He grants
        life to the living beings; O Lord, please keep me according to
        Your Will.  || 5 || 19 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  Let the body
        be the Brahmin, and let the mind be the loin-cloth; let spiritual
        wisdom be the sacred thread, and meditation the ceremonial ring.
        I seek the Name of the Lord and His Praise as my cleansing bath.
        By Guru's Grace, I am absorbed into God.  || 1 ||   O Pandit,
        O religious scholar, contemplate God in such a way that His Name
        may sanctify you, that His Name may be your study, and His Name
        your wisdom and way of life.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The outer sacred
        thread is worthwhile only as long as the Divine Light is within.
        So make the remembrance of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, your
        loin-cloth and the ceremonial mark on your forehead. Here and
        hereafter, the Name alone shall stand by you. Do not seek any
        other actions, except the Name.  || 2 ||   Worship the Lord in
        loving adoration, and burn your desire for Maya. Behold only the
        One Lord, and do not seek out any other. Become aware of reality,
        in the Sky of the Tenth Gate; read aloud the Lord's Word,
        and contemplate it.  || 3 ||   With the diet of His Love, doubt
        and fear depart. With the Lord as your night watchman, no thief
        will dare to break in. Let the knowledge of the One God be the
        ceremonial mark on your forehead. Let the realization that God
        is within you be your discrimination.  || 4 ||   Through ritual
        actions, God cannot be won over; by reciting sacred scriptures,
        His value cannot be estimated. The eighteen Puraanas and the four
        Vedas do not know His mystery. O Nanak, the True Guru has shown
        me the Lord God.  || 5 || 20 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  He alone
        is the selfless servant, slave and humble devotee, who as Gurmukh,
        becomes the slave of his Lord and Master. He, who created the
        Universe, shall ultimately destroy it. Without Him, there is no
        other at all.  || 1 ||   Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        the Gurmukh reflects upon the True Name; in the True Court, he
        is found to be true.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The true supplication,
        the true prayer  -  within the Mansion of His Sublime Presence,
        the True Lord Master hears and applauds these. He summons the
        truthful to His Heavenly Throne and bestows glorious greatness
        upon them; that which He wills, comes to pass.  || 2 ||   The
        Power is Yours; You are my only Support. The Word of the Guru's
        Shabad is my true password. One who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command, goes to Him openly. With the password of truth, his way
        is not blocked.  || 3 ||   The Pandit reads and expounds on the
        Vedas, but he does not know the secret of the thing within himself.
        Without the Guru, understanding and realization are not obtained;
        but still God is True, pervading everywhere.  || 4 ||   What should
        I say, or speak or describe? Only You Yourself know, O Lord of
        total wonder. Nanak takes the Support of the Door of the One God.
        There, at the True Door, the Gurmukhs sustain themselves.  ||
        5 || 21 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  The clay pitcher of the body
        is miserable; it suffers in pain through birth and death. How
        can this terrifying world-ocean be crossed over? Without the Lord
        -  Guru, it cannot be crossed.  || 1 ||   Without You, there
        is no other at all, O my Beloved; without you, there is no other
        at all. You are in all colors and forms; he alone is forgiven,
        upon whom You bestow Your Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Maya, my mother-in-law, is evil; she does not let me live in
        my own home. The vicious one does not let me meet with my Husband
        Lord. </p>

      <p> I serve at the feet of my companions and friends; the Lord has
        showered me with His Mercy, through Guru's Grace.  || 2 ||
        Reflecting upon my self, and conquering my mind, I have seen
        that there is no other friend like You. As You keep me, so do
        I live. You are the Giver of peace and pleasure. Whatever You
        do, comes to pass.  || 3 ||   Hope and desire have both been dispelled;
        I have renounced my longing for the three qualities. The Gurmukh
        obtains the state of ecstasy, taking to the Shelter of the Saints'
        Congregation.  || 4 ||   All wisdom and meditation, all chanting
        and penance, come to one whose heart is filled with the Invisible,
        Inscrutable Lord. O Nanak, one whose mind is imbued with the Lord's
        Name, finds the Guru's Teachings, and intuitively serves.
        || 5 || 22 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL,  PANCH-PADAS:  Your attachment
        to your family, your attachment to all your affairs  -  renounce
        all your attachments, for they are all corrupt.  || 1 ||   Renounce
        your attachments and doubts, O brother, and dwell upon the True
        Name within your heart and body.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When one
        receives the nine treasures of the True Name, his children do
        not weep, and his mother does not grieve.  || 2 ||   In this attachment,
        the world is drowning. Few are the Gurmukhs who swim across. 
        || 3 ||   In this attachment, people are reincarnated over and
        over again. Attached to emotional attachment, they go to the city
        of Death.  || 4 ||   You have received the Guru's Teachings
        -  now practice meditation and penance. If attachment is not
        broken, no one is approved.  || 5 ||   But if He bestows His Glance
        of Grace, then this attachment departs. O Nanak, then one remains
        merged in the Lord.  || 6 || 23 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  He Himself
        does everything, the True, Invisible, Infinite Lord. I am a sinner,
        You are the Forgiver.  || 1 ||   By Your Will, everything come
        to pass. One who acts in stubborn-mindedness is ruined in the
        end.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The intellect of the self-willed manmukh
        is engrossed in falsehood. Without the meditative remembrance
        of the Lord, it suffers in sin.  || 2 ||   Renounce evil-mindedness,
        and you shall reap the rewards. Whoever is born, comes through
        the Unknowable and Mysterious Lord.  || 3 ||   Such is my Friend
        and Companion; meeting with the Guru, the Lord, devotion was implanted
        within me.  || 4 ||   In all other transactions, one suffers loss.
        The Name of the Lord is pleasing to Nanak's mind.  || 5 ||
        24 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL,  CHAU-PADAS:  Contemplate and reflect
        upon knowledge, and you will become a benefactor to others. When
        you conquer the five passions, then you shall come to dwell at
        the sacred shrine of pilgrimage.  || 1 ||   You shall hear the
        vibrations of the tinkling bells, when your mind is held steady.
        So what can the Messenger of Death do to me hereafter?  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   When you abandon hope and desire, then you become
        a true Sannyaasi. When the Yogi practices abstinence, then he
        enjoys his body.  || 2 ||   Through compassion, the naked hermit
        reflects upon his inner self. He slays his own self, instead of
        slaying others.  || 3 ||   You, O Lord, are the One, but You have
        so many Forms. Nanak does not know Your wondrous plays.  || 4
        || 25 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  I am not stained by only one sin,
        that could be washed clean by virtue. My Husband Lord is awake,
        while I sleep through the entire night of my life.  || 1 ||  
        In this way, how can I become dear to my Husband Lord? My Husband
        Lord remains awake, while I sleep through the entire night of
        my life.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> With hope and desire, I approach His Bed, but I do not know whether
        He will be pleased with me or not.  || 2 ||   How do I know what
        will happen to me, O my mother? Without the Blessed Vision of
        the Lord's Darshan, I cannot survive.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        I have not tasted His Love, and my thirst is not quenched. My
        beautiful youth has run away, and now I, the soul-bride, repent
        and regret.  || 3 ||   Even now, I am held by hope and desire.
        I am depressed; I have no hope at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   She
        overcomes her egotism, and adorns herself; the Husband Lord now
        ravishes and enjoys the soul-bride on His Bed.  || 4 ||   Then,
        O Nanak, the bride becomes pleasing to the Mind of her Husband
        Lord; she sheds her self-conceit, and is absorbed in her Lord
        and Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 26 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  In
        this world of my father's house, I, the soul-bride, have
        been very childish; I did not realize the value of my Husband
        Lord.  || 1 ||   My Husband is the One; there is no other like
        Him. If He bestows His Glance of Grace, then I shall meet Him.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the next world of my in-law's house,
        I, the the soul-bride, shall realize Truth; I shall come to know
        the celestial peace of my Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   By Guru's
        Grace, such wisdom comes to me, so that the soul-bride becomes
        pleasing to the Mind of the Husband Lord.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak,
        she who adorns herself with the Love and the Fear of God, enjoys
        her Husband Lord forever on His Bed.  || 4 || 27 ||   AASAA, 
        FIRST MEHL:  No one is anyone else's son, and no one is anyone
        else's mother. Through false attachments, people wander around
        in doubt.  || 1 ||   O My Lord and Master, I am created by You.
        If You give it to me, I will chant Your Name.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   That person who is filled with all sorts of sins may pray
        at the Lord's Door, but he is forgiven only when the Lord
        so wills.  || 2 ||   By Guru's Grace, evil-mindedness is
        destroyed. Wherever I look, there I find the One Lord.  || 3 ||
        Says Nanak, if one comes to such an understanding, then he is
        absorbed into the Truest of the True.  || 4 || 28 ||   AASAA,
        FIRST MEHL,  DU-PADAS:  In that pool of the world, the people
        have their homes; there, the Lord has created water and fire.
        In the mud of earthly attachment, their feet have become mired,
        and I have seen them drowning there.  || 1 ||   O foolish people,
        why don't you remember the One Lord? Forgetting the Lord,
        your virtues shall wither away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am not
        a celibate, nor am I truthful, nor a scholar; I was born foolish
        and ignorant. Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those who do
        not forget You, Lord.  || 2 || 29 ||   AASAA,  FIRST MEHL:  There
        are six systems of philosophy, six teachers, and six doctrines;
        but the Teacher of teachers is the One Lord, who appears in so
        many forms.  || 1 ||   That system, where the Praises of the Creator
        are sung  -  follow that system; in it rests greatness.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   As the seconds, minutes, hours, days, weekdays
        months and seasons all originate from the one sun, O Nanak, so
        do all forms originate from the One Creator.  || 2 || 30 || <br>
