      <p> <font color="#000000">When you meet a Saint, talk to him and listen.
        Meeting with an unsaintly person, just remain silent.  || 1 ||
        O father, if I speak, what words should I utter? Speak such
        words, by which you may remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Speaking with the Saints, one becomes generous.
        To speak with a fool is to babble uselessly.  || 2 ||   By speaking
        and only speaking, corruption only increases. If I do not speak,
        what can the poor wretch do?  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, the empty
        pitcher makes noise, but that which is full makes no sound.  ||
        4 || 1 ||   GOND:  When a man dies, he is of no use to anyone.
        But when an animal dies, it is used in ten ways.  || 1 ||   What
        do I know, about the state of my karma? What do I know, O Baba?
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   His bones burn, like a bundle of logs; his
        hair burns like a bale of hay.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, the man
        wakes up, only when the Messenger of Death hits him over the head
        with his club.  || 3 || 2 ||   GOND:  The Celestial Lord is in
        the Akaashic ethers of the skies, the Celestial Lord is in the
        nether regions of the underworld; in the four directions, the
        Celestial Lord is pervading. The Supreme Lord God is forever the
        source of bliss. When the vessel of the body perishes, the Celestial
        Lord does not perish.  || 1 ||   I have become sad, wondering
        where the soul comes from, and where it goes.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The body is formed from the union of the five tatvas; but
        where were the five tatvas created? You say that the soul is tied
        to its karma, but who gave karma to the body?  || 2 ||   The body
        is contained in the Lord, and the Lord is contained in the body.
        He is permeating within all. Says Kabeer, I shall not renounce
        the Lord's Name. I shall accept whatever happens.  || 3

      <p> <font color="#000000">They tied my arms, bundled me up, and threw
        me before an elephant. The elephant driver struck him on the head,
        and infuriated him. But the elephant ran away, trumpeting, &quot;I
        am a sacrifice to this image of the Lord.&quot;  || 1 ||   O
        my Lord and Master, You are my strength. The Qazi shouted at the
        driver to drive the elephant on.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He yelled
        out, &quot;O driver, I shall cut you into pieces. Hit him, and
        drive him on!&quot; But the elephant did not move; instead, he
        began to meditate. The Lord God abides within his mind.  || 2
        ||   What sin has this Saint committed, that you have made him
        into a bundle and thrown him before the elephant? Lifting up the
        bundle, the elephant bows down before it. The Qazi could not understand
        it; he was blind.  || 3 ||   Three times, he tried to do it. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Even then, his hardened mind was not satisfied. Says Kabeer, such
        is my Lord and Master. The soul of His humble servant dwells in
        the fourth state.  || 4 || 1 || 4 ||  GOND:  It is not human,
        and it is not a god. It is not called celibate, or a worshipper
        of Shiva. It is not a Yogi, and it is not a hermit. It is not
        a mother, or anyone's son.  || 1 ||   Then what is it,
        which dwells in this temple of the body? No one can find its limits.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   It is not a house-holder, and it is not
        a renouncer of the world. It is not a king, and it is not a beggar.
        It has no body, no drop of blood. It is not a Brahmin, and it
        is not a Kh'shaatriya.  || 2 ||   It is not called a man
        of austere self-discipline, or a Shaykh. It does not live, and
        it is not seen to die. If someone cries over its death, that person
        loses his honor.  || 3 ||   By Guru's Grace, I have found
        the Path. Birth and death have both been erased. Says Kabeer,
        this is formed of the same essence as the Lord. It is like the
        ink on the paper which cannot be erased.  || 4 || 2 || 5 ||  
        GOND:  The threads are broken, and the starch has run out. Bare
        reeds glisten at the front door. The poor brushes are scattered
        in pieces. Death has entered this shaven head.  || 1 ||   This
        shaven-headed mendicant has wasted all his wealth. All this coming
        and going has irritated him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He has given
        up all talk of his weaving equipment. His mind is attuned to the
        Lord's Name. His daughters and sons have nothing to eat,
        while the shaven-headed mendicants night and day eat their fill.
        || 2 ||   One or two are in the house, and one or two more are
        on the way. We sleep on the floor, while they sleep in the beds.
        They rub their bare heads, and carry prayer-books in their waist-bands.
        We get dry grains, while they get loaves of bread.  || 3 ||  
        He will become one of these shaven-headed mendicants. They are
        the support of the drowning. Listen, O blind and unguided Loi:
        Kabeer has taken shelter with these shaven-headed mendicants.
        || 4 || 3 || 6 ||   GOND:  When her husband dies, the woman does
        not cry. Someone else becomes her protector. When this protector
        dies, he falls into the world of hell hereafter, for the sexual
        pleasures he enjoyed in this world.  || 1 ||   The world loves
        only the one bride, Maya. She is the wife of all beings and creatures.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   With her necklace around her neck, this
        bride looks beautiful. She is poison to the Saint, but the world
        is delighted with her. Adorning herself, she sits like a prostitute.
        Cursed by the Saints, she wanders around like a wretch.  || 2
        ||   She runs around, chasing after the Saints. She is afraid
        of being beaten by those blessed with the Guru's Grace.
        She is the body, the breath of life, of the faithless cynics.
        She appears to me like a blood-thirsty witch.  || 3 ||   I know
        her secrets well - in His Mercy, the Divine Guru met me.
        Says Kabeer, now I have thrown her out. She clings to the skirt
        of the world.  || 4 || 4 || 7 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> GOND:  When someone's household has no glory, the guests
        who come there depart still hungry. Deep within, there is no contentment.
        Without his bride, the wealth of Maya, he suffers in pain.  ||
        1 ||   So praise this bride, which can shake the consciousness
        of even the most dedicated ascetics and sages.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   This bride is the daughter of a wretched miser. Abandoning
        the Lord's servant, she sleeps with the world. Standing
        at the door of the holy man, she says, &quot;I have come to
        your sanctuary; now save me!&quot;  || 2 ||   This bride is so
        beautiful. The bells on her ankles make soft music. As long as
        there is the breath of life in the man, she remains attached to
        him. But when it is no more, she quickly gets up and departs,
        bare-footed.  || 3 ||   This bride has conquered the three worlds.
        The eighteen Puraanas and the sacred shrines of pilgrimage love
        her as well. She pierced the hearts of Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu.
        She destroyed the great emperors and kings of the world.  || 4
        ||   This bride has no restraint or limits. She is in collusion
        with the five thieving passions. When the clay pot of these five
        passions bursts, then, says Kabeer, by Guru's Mercy, one
        is released.  || 5 || 5 || 8 ||   GOND:  As the house will not
        stand when the supporting beams are removed from within it, just
        so, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, how can anyone be
        carried across? Without the pitcher, the water is not contained;
        just so, without the Holy Saint, the mortal departs in misery.
        || 1 ||   One who does not remember the Lord - let him
        burn; his body and mind have remained absorbed in this field of
        the world.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without a farmer, the land is
        not planted; without a thread, how can the beads be strung? Without
        a loop, how can the knot be tied? Just so, without the Holy Saint,
        the mortal departs in misery.  || 2 ||   Without a mother or father
        there is no child; just so, without water, how can the clothes
        be washed? Without a horse, how can there be a rider? Without
        the Holy Saint, one cannot reach the Court of the Lord.  || 3
        ||   Just as without music, there is no dancing, the bride rejected
        by her husband is dishonored. Says Kabeer, do this one thing:
        become Gurmukh, and you shall never die again.  || 4 || 6 || 9
        ||   GOND:  He alone is a pimp, who pounds down his mind. Pounding
        down his mind, he escapes from the Messenger of Death. Pounding
        and beating his mind, he puts it to the test; such a pimp attains
        total liberation.  || 1 ||   Who is called a pimp in this world?
        In all speech, one must carefully consider.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        He alone is a dancer, who dances with his mind. The Lord is
        not satisfied with falsehood; He is pleased only with Truth. So
        play the beat of the drum in the mind. The Lord is the Protector
        of the dancer with such a mind.  || 2 ||   She alone is a street-dancer,
        who cleanses her body-street, and educates the five passions.
        She who embraces devotional worship for the Lord - I accept
        such a street-dancer as my Guru.  || 3 ||   He alone is a thief,
        who is above envy, and who uses his sense organs to chant the
        Lord's Name. Says Kabeer, these are the qualities of the
        one I know as my Blessed Divine Guru, who is the most beautiful
        and wise. <br>

      </p>
      <p> || 4 || 7 || 10 ||   GOND:  Blessed is the Lord of the World.
        Blessed is the Divine Guru. Blessed is that grain, by which the
        heart-lotus of the hungry blossoms forth. Blessed are those Saints,
        who know this. Meeting with them, one meets the Lord, the Sustainer
        of the World.  || 1 ||   This grain comes from the Primal Lord
        God. One chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, only when he tastes
        this grain.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate on the Naam, and meditate
        on this grain. Mixed with water, its taste becomes sublime. One
        who abstains from this grain, loses his honor in the three worlds.
        || 2 ||   One who discards this grain, is practicing hypocrisy.
        She is neither a happy soul-bride, nor a widow. Those who claim
        in this world that they live on milk alone, secretly eat whole
        loads of food.  || 3 ||   Without this grain, time does not pass
        in peace. Forsaking this grain, one does not meet the Lord of
        the World. Says Kabeer, this I know: blessed is that grain, which
        brings faith in the Lord and Master to the mind.  || 4 || 8 ||

        Name. Meditate on your Lord, you lazy man!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Offering sweet rice at Gaya, living on the river banks at Benares,
        reciting the four Vedas by heart;  || 2 ||   Completing all religious
        rituals, restraining sexual passion by the spiritual wisdom given

        religion. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, erases social
        classes and ancestral pedigrees. The Lord is the walking stick
        of the blind.  || 1 ||   I bow to the Lord, I humbly bow to the
        Lord. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, you will not be
        tormented by the Messenger of Death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        Lord took the life of Harnaakhash, and gave Ajaamal a place in
        heaven. Teaching a parrot to speak the Lord's Name, Ganika
        the prostitute was saved. That Lord is the light of my eyes. 
        || 2 ||   Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Pootna was
        saved, even though she was a deceitful child-killer. Contemplating
        the Lord, Dropadi was saved. Gautam's wife, turned to stone,
        was saved.  || 3 ||   The Lord, who killed Kaysee and Kans, gave
        the gift of life to Kali. Prays Naam Dayv, such is my Lord; meditating
        on Him, fear and suffering are dispelled.  || 4 || 1 || 5 || 
        GOND:  One who chases after the god Bhairau, evil spirits and
        the goddess of smallpox, is riding on a donkey, kicking up the
        dust.  || 1 ||   I take only the Name of the One Lord. I have
        given away all other gods in exchange for Him.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   That man who chants &quot;Shiva, Shiva&quot;, and meditates
        on him, is riding on a bull, shaking a tambourine.  || 2 ||  
        One who worships the Great Goddess Maya will be reincarnated as
        a woman, and not a man.  || 3 ||   You are called the Primal Goddess.
        At the time of liberation, where will you hide then?  || 4 ||
        Follow the Guru's Teachings, and hold tight to the Lord's
        Name, O friend. Thus prays Naam Dayv, and so says the Gita as
        well.  || 5 || 2 || 6 ||   BILAAVAL  GOND:  Today, Naam Dayv saw
        the Lord, and so I will instruct the ignorant.  ||  Pause  ||
        O Pandit, O religious scholar, your Gayatri was grazing in the
        fields. Taking a stick, the farmer broke its leg, and now it walks
        with a limp.  || 1 ||   O Pandit, I saw your great god Shiva,
        riding along on a white bull. <br>

      <p> In the merchant's house, a banquet was prepared for him
        - he killed the merchant's son.  || 2 ||   O Pandit,
        I saw your Raam Chand coming too; he lost his wife, fighting a
        war against Raawan.  || 3 ||   The Hindu is sightless; the Muslim
        has only one eye. The spiritual teacher is wiser than both of
        them. The Hindu worships at the temple, the Muslim at the mosque.
        Naam Dayv serves that Lord, who is not limited to either the temple
        or the mosque.  || 4 || 3 || 7 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Meditate on the Lord Mukanday, the Liberator,
        O people of the world. Without Mukanday, the body shall be reduced
        to ashes. Mukanday is the Giver of liberation. Mukanday is my
        father and mother.  || 1 ||   Meditate on Mukanday in life, and
        meditate on Mukanday in death. His servant is blissful forever.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord, Mukanday, is my breath of life.
        Meditating on Mukanday, one's forehead will bear the Lord's
        insignia of approval. The renunciate serves Mukanday. Mukanday
        is the wealth of the poor and forlorn.  || 2 ||   When the One
        Liberator does me a favor, then what can the world do to me? Erasing
        my social status, I have entered His Court. You, Mukanday, are
        potent throughout the four ages.  || 3 ||   Spiritual wisdom has
        welled up, and I have been enlightened. In His Mercy, the Lord
        has made this worm His slave. Says Ravi Daas, now my thirst is
        quenched; I meditate on Mukanday the Liberator, and I serve Him.
        || 4 || 1 ||   GOND:  Someone may bathe at the sixty-eight sacred
        shrines of pilgrimage, and worship the twelve Shiva-lingam stones,
        and dig wells and pools, but if he indulges in slander, then all
        of this is useless.  || 1 ||   How can the slanderer of the Holy
        Saints be saved? Know for certain, that he shall go to hell. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Someone may bathe at Kuruk-shaytra during
        a solar eclipse, and give his decorated wife in offering, and
        listen to all the Simritees, but if he indulges in slander, these
        are of no account.  || 2 ||   Someone may give countless feasts,
        and donate land, and build splendid buildings; he may neglect
        his own affairs to work for others, but if he indulges in slander,
        he shall wander in countless incarnations.  || 3 ||   Why do you
        indulge in slander, O people of the world? The emptiness of the
        slanderer is soon exposed. I have thought, and determined the
        fate of the slanderer. Says Ravi Daas, he is a sinner; he shall
        go to hell.  || 4 || 2 || 11 || 7 || 2 ||  49 Total  || </font><br>
