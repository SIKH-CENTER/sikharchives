      <p> But when the time comes to settle their accounts, their red robes
        are corrupt. His Love is not obtained through hypocrisy. Her false
        coverings bring only ruin.  || 1 ||   In this way, the Dear Husband
        Lord ravishes and enjoys His bride. The happy soul-bride is pleasing
        to You, Lord; by Your Grace, You adorn her.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        She is decorated with the Word of the Guru's Shabad; her
        mind and body belong to her Husband Lord. With her palms pressed
        together, she stands, waiting on Him, and offers her True prayers
        to Him. Dyed in the deep crimson of the Love of her Darling Lord,
        she dwells in the Fear of the True One. Imbued with His Love,
        she is dyed in the color of His Love.  || 2 ||   She is said to
        be the hand-maiden of her Beloved Lord; His sweetheart surrenders
        to His Name. True Love is never broken; she is united in Union
        with the True One. Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, her mind
        is pierced through. I am forever a sacrifice to Him.  || 3 ||
        That bride, who is absorbed into the True Guru, shall never
        become a widow. Her Husband Lord is Beautiful; His Body is forever
        fresh and new. The True One does not die, and shall not go. He
        continually enjoys His happy soul-bride; He casts His Gracious
        Glance of Truth upon her, and she abides in His Will.  || 4 ||
        The bride braids her hair with Truth; her clothes are decorated
        with His Love. Like the essence of sandalwood, He permeates her
        consciousness, and the Temple of the Tenth Gate is opened. The
        lamp of the Shabad is lit, and the Name of the Lord is her necklace.
        || 5 ||   She is the most beautiful among women; upon her forehead
        she wears the Jewel of the Lord's Love. Her glory and her
        wisdom are magnificent; her love for the Infinite Lord is True.
        Other than her Beloved Lord, she knows no man. She enshrines love
        for the True Guru.  || 6 ||   Asleep in the darkness of the night,
        how shall she pass her life-night without her Husband? Her limbs
        shall burn, her body shall burn, and her mind and wealth shall
        burn as well. When the Husband does not enjoy His bride, then
        her youth passes away in vain.  || 7 ||   The Husband is on the
        Bed, but the bride is asleep, and so she does not come to know
        Him. While I am asleep, my Husband Lord is awake. Where can I
        go for advice? The True Guru has led me to meet Him, and now I
        dwell in the Fear of God. O Nanak, His Love is always with me.
        || 8 || 2 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  O Lord, You are Your
        Own Glorious Praise. You Yourself speak it; You Yourself hear
        it and contemplate it. You Yourself are the Jewel, and You are
        the Appraiser. You Yourself are of Infinite Value. O True Lord,
        You are Honor and Glory; You Yourself are the Giver.  || 1 ||
        O Dear Lord, You are the Creator and the Cause. If it is Your
        Will, please save and protect me; please bless me with the lifestyle
        of the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You Yourself are
        the flawless diamond; You Yourself are the deep crimson color.
        You Yourself are the perfect pearl; You Yourself are the devotee
        and the priest. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You
        are praised. In each and every heart, the Unseen is seen.  ||
        2 ||   You Yourself are the ocean and the boat. You Yourself are
        this shore, and the one beyond. O All-knowing Lord, You are the
        True Way. The Shabad is the Navigator to ferry us across. One
        who does not fear God shall live in fear; without the Guru, there
        is only pitch darkness.  || 3 ||   The Creator alone is seen to
        be Eternal; all others come and go. Only You, Lord, are Immaculate
        and Pure. All others are bound up in worldly pursuits. Those who
        are protected by the Guru are saved. </p>

      <p> They are lovingly attuned to the True Lord.  || 4 ||   Through
        the Shabad, they recognize the Dear Lord; through the Guru's
        Word, they are attuned to Truth. Filth does not stick to the body
        of one who has secured a dwelling in his True Home. When the Lord
        bestows His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name. Without
        the Name, who are our relatives?  || 5 ||   Those who have realized
        the Truth are at peace throughout the four ages. Subduing their
        egotism and desires, they keep the True Name enshrined in their
        hearts. In this world, the only real profit is the Name of the
        One Lord; it is earned by contemplating the Guru.  || 6 ||   Loading
        the Merchandise of the True Name, you shall gather in your profits
        forever with the Capital of Truth. In the Court of the True One,
        you shall sit in truthful devotion and prayer. Your account shall
        be settled with honor, in the Radiant Light of the Name of the
        Lord.  || 7 ||   The Lord is said to be the Highest of the High;
        no one can perceive Him. Wherever I look, I see only You. The
        True Guru has inspired me to see You. The Divine Light within
        is revealed, O Nanak, through this intuitive understanding.  ||
        8 || 3 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  The fish did not notice
        the net in the deep and salty sea. It was so clever and beautiful,
        but why was it so confident? By its actions it was caught, and
        now death cannot be turned away from its head.  || 1 ||   O Siblings
        of Destiny, just like this, see death hovering over your own heads!
        People are just like this fish; unaware, the noose of death descends
        upon them.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The whole world is bound by death;
        without the Guru, death cannot be avoided. Those who are attuned
        to Truth are saved; they renounce duality and corruption. I am
        a sacrifice to those who are found to be Truthful in the True
        Court.  || 2 ||   Think of the hawk preying on the birds, and
        the net in the hands of the hunter. Those who are protected by
        the Guru are saved; the others are caught by the bait. Without
        the Name, they are picked up and thrown away; they have no friends
        or companions.  || 3 ||   God is said to be the Truest of the
        True; His Place is the Truest of the True. Those who obey the
        True One - their minds abide in true meditation. Those who
        become Gurmukh, and obtain spiritual wisdom - their minds and
        mouths are known to be pure.  || 4 ||   Offer your most sincere
        prayers to the True Guru, so that He may unite you with your Best
        Friend. Meeting your Best Friend, you shall find peace; the Messenger
        of Death shall take poison and die. I dwell deep within the Name;
        the Name has come to dwell within my mind.  || 5 ||   Without
        the Guru, there is only pitch darkness; without the Shabad, understanding
        is not obtained. Through the Guru's Teachings, you shall be enlightened;
        remain absorbed in the Love of the True Lord. Death does not go
        there; your light shall merge with the Light.  || 6 ||   You are
        my Best Friend; You are All-knowing. You are the One who unites
        us with Yourself. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        we praise You; You have no end or limitation. Death does not reach
        that place, where the Infinite Word of the Guru's Shabad
        resounds.  || 7 ||   By the Hukam of His Command, all are created.
        By His Command, actions are performed. By His Command, all are
        subject to death; by His Command, they merge in Truth. O Nanak,
        whatever pleases His Will comes to pass. Nothing is in the hands
        of these beings.  || 8 || 4 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  If
        the mind is polluted, then the body is polluted, and the tongue
        is polluted as well. </p>

      <p> With false mouths, people speak falsehood. How can they be made
        pure? Without the Holy Water of the Shabad, they are not cleansed.
        From the True One alone comes Truth.  || 1 ||   O soul-bride,
        without virtue, what happiness can there be? The Husband Lord
        enjoys her with pleasure and delight; she is at peace in the love
        of the True Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When the
        Husband goes away, the bride suffers in the pain of separation,
        like the fish in shallow water, crying for mercy. As it pleases
        the Will of the Husband Lord, peace is obtained, when He Himself
        casts His Glance of Grace.  || 2 ||   Praise your Husband Lord,
        together with your bridesmaids and friends. The body is beautified,
        and the mind is fascinated. Imbued with His Love, we are enraptured.
        Adorned with the Shabad, the beautiful bride enjoys her Husband
        with virtue.  || 3 ||   The soul-bride is of no use at all, if
        she is evil and without virtue. She does not find peace in this
        world or the next; she burns in falsehood and corruption. Coming
        and going are very difficult for that bride who is abandoned and
        forgotten by her Husband Lord.  || 4 ||   The beautiful soul-bride
        of the Husband Lord - by what sensual pleasures has she been
        doomed? She is of no use to her Husband if she babbles in useless
        arguments. At the Door of His Home, she finds no shelter; she
        is discarded for seeking other pleasures.  || 5 ||   The Pandits,
        the religious scholars, read their books, but they do not understand
        the real meaning. They give instructions to others, and then walk
        away, but they deal in Maya themselves. Speaking falsehood, they
        wander around the world, while those who remain true to the Shabad
        are excellent and exalted.  || 6 ||   There are so many Pandits
        and astrologers who ponder over the Vedas. They glorify their
        disputes and arguments, and in these controversies they continue
        coming and going. Without the Guru, they are not released from
        their karma, although they speak and listen and preach and explain.
        || 7 ||   They all call themselves virtuous, but I have no virtue
        at all. With the Lord as her Husband, the soul-bride is happy;
        I, too, love that God. O Nanak, through the Shabad, union is obtained;
        there is no more separation.  || 8 || 5 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST
        MEHL:  You may chant and meditate, practice austerities and self-restraint,
        and dwell at sacred shrines of pilgrimage; you may give donations
        to charity, and perform good deeds, but without the True One,
        what is the use of it all? As you plant, so shall you harvest.
        Without virtue, this human life passes away in vain.  || 1 ||
        O young bride, be a slave to virtue, and you shall find peace.
        Renouncing wrongful actions, following the Guru's Teachings, you
        shall be absorbed into the Perfect One.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        Without capital, the trader looks around in all four directions.
        He does not understand his own origins; the merchandise remains
        within the door of his own house. Without this commodity, there
        is great pain. The false are ruined by falsehood.  || 2 ||   One
        who contemplates and appraises this Jewel day and night reaps
        new profits. He finds the merchandise within his own home, and
        departs after arranging his affairs. So trade with the true traders,
        and as Gurmukh, contemplate God.  || 3 ||   In the Society of
        the Saints, He is found, if the Uniter unites us. One whose heart
        is filled with His Infinite Light meets with Him, and shall never
        again be separated from Him. True is his position; he abides in
        Truth, with love and affection for the True One.  || 4 ||   One
        who understands himself finds the Mansion of the Lord's Presence
        within his own home. Imbued with the True Lord, Truth is gathered
        in. </p>

      <p> God is known throughout the three worlds. True is the Name of
        the True One.  || 5 ||   The wife who knows that her Husband Lord
        is always with her is very beautiful. The soul-bride is called
        to the Mansion of the His Presence, and her Husband Lord ravishes
        her with love. The happy soul-bride is true and good; she is fascinated
        by the Glories of her Husband Lord.  || 6 ||   Wandering around
        and making mistakes, I climb the plateau; having climbed the plateau,
        I go up the mountain. But now I have lost my way, and I am wandering
        around in the forest; without the Guru, I do not understand. If
        I wander around forgetting God's Name, I shall continue coming
        and going in reincarnation, over and over again.  || 7 ||   Go
        and ask the travellers, how to walk on the Path as His slave.
        They know the Lord to be their King, and at the Door to His Home,
        their way is not blocked. O Nanak, the One is pervading everywhere;
        there is no other at all.  || 8 || 6 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:
        Through the Guru, the Pure One is known, and the human body becomes
        pure as well. The Pure, True Lord abides within the mind; He knows
        the pain of our hearts. With intuitive ease, a great peace is
        found, and the arrow of death shall not strike you.  || 1 || 
        O Siblings of Destiny, filth is washed away by bathing in the
        Pure Water of the Name. You alone are Perfectly Pure, O True Lord;
        all other places are filled with filth.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        The Temple of the Lord is beautiful; it was made by the Creator
        Lord. The sun and the moon are lamps of incomparably beautiful
        light. Throughout the three worlds, the Infinite Light is pervading.
        In the shops of the city of the body, in the fortresses and in
        the huts, the True Merchandise is traded.  || 2 ||   The ointment
        of spiritual wisdom is the destroyer of fear; through love, the
        Pure One is seen. The mysteries of the seen and the unseen are
        all known, if the mind is kept centered and balanced. If one finds
        such a True Guru, the Lord is met with intuitive ease.  || 3 ||
        He draws us to His Touchstone, to test our love and consciousness.
        The counterfeit have no place there, but the genuine are placed
        in His Treasury. Let your hopes and anxieties depart; thus pollution
        is washed away.  || 4 ||   Everyone begs for happiness; no one
        asks for suffering. But in the wake of happiness, there comes
        great suffering. The self-willed manmukhs do not understand this.
        Those who see pain and pleasure as one and the same find peace;
        they are pierced through by the Shabad.  || 5 ||   The Vedas proclaim,
        and the words of Vyaasa tell us, that the silent sages, the servants
        of the Lord, and those who practice a life of spiritual discipline
        are attuned to the Naam, the Treasure of Excellence. Those who
        are attuned to the True Name win the game of life; I am forever
        a sacrifice to them.  || 6 ||   Those who do not have the Naam
        in their mouths are filled with pollution; they are filthy throughout
        the four ages. Without loving devotion to God, their faces are
        blackened, and their honor is lost. Those who have forgotten the
        Naam are plundered by evil; they weep and wail in dismay.  ||
        7 ||   I searched and searched, and found God. In the Fear of
        God, I have been united in His Union. Through self-realization,
        people dwell within the home of their inner being; egotism and
        desire depart. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Name of the
        Lord are immaculate and radiant.  || 8 || 7 ||   SIREE RAAG, 
        FIRST MEHL:  Listen, O deluded and demented mind: hold tight to
        the Guru's Feet. Chant and meditate on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord; death will be afraid of you, and suffering shall
        depart. The deserted wife suffers terrible pain. </p>

      <p> How can her Husband Lord remain with her forever?  || 1 ||   O
        Siblings of Destiny, I have no other place to go. The Guru has
        given me the Treasure of the Wealth of the Naam; I am a sacrifice
        to Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru's Teachings bring
        honor. Blessed is He - may I meet and be with Him! Without
        Him, I cannot live, even for a moment. Without His Name, I die.
        I am blind - may I never forget the Naam! Under His Protection,
        I shall reach my true home.  || 2 ||   Those chaylaas, those devotees,
        whose spiritual teacher is blind, shall not find their place of
        rest. Without the True Guru, the Name is not obtained. Without
        the Name, what is the use of it all? People come and go, regretting
        and repenting, like crows in a deserted house.  || 3 ||   Without
        the Name, the body suffers in pain; it crumbles like a wall of
        sand. As long as Truth does not enter into the consciousness,
        the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is not found. Attuned
        to the Shabad, we enter our home, and obtain the Eternal State
        of Nirvaanaa.  || 4 ||   I ask my Guru for His Advice, and I follow
        the Guru's Advice. With the Shabads of Praise abiding in
        the mind, the pain of egotism is burnt away. We are intuitively
        united with Him, and we meet the Truest of the True.  || 5 ||
        Those who are attuned to the Shabad are spotless and pure; they
        renounce sexual desire, anger, selfishness and conceit. They sing
        the Praises of the Naam, forever and ever; they keep the Lord
        enshrined within their hearts. How could we ever forget Him from
        our minds? He is the Support of all beings.  || 6 ||   One who
        dies in the Shabad is beyond death, and shall never die again.
        Through the Shabad, we find Him, and embrace love for the Name
        of the Lord. Without the Shabad, the world is deceived; it dies
        and is reborn, over and over again.  || 7 ||   All praise themselves,
        and call themselves the greatest of the great. Without the Guru,
        one's self cannot be known. By merely speaking and listening,
        what is accomplished? O Nanak, one who realizes the Shabad does
        not act in egotism.  || 8 || 8 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL: 
        Without her Husband, the soul-bride's youth and ornaments
        are useless and wretched. She does not enjoy the pleasure of His
        Bed; without her Husband, her ornaments are absurd. The discarded
        bride suffers terrible pain; her Husband does not come to the
        bed of her home.  || 1 ||   O mind, meditate on the Lord, and
        find peace. Without the Guru, love is not found. United with the
        Shabad, happiness is found.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Serving the
        Guru, she finds peace, and her Husband Lord adorns her with intuitive
        wisdom. Truly, she enjoys the Bed of her Husband, through her
        deep love and affection. As Gurmukh, she comes to know Him. Meeting
        with the Guru, she maintains a virtuous lifestyle.  || 2 ||  
        Through Truth, meet your Husband Lord, O soul-bride. Enchanted
        by your Husband, enshrine love for Him. Your mind and body shall
        blossom forth in Truth. The value of this cannot be described.
        The soul-bride finds her Husband Lord in the home of her own being;
        she is purified by the True Name.  || 3 ||   If the mind within
        the mind dies, then the Husband ravishes and enjoys His bride.
        They are woven into one texture, like pearls on a necklace around
        the neck. In the Society of the Saints, peace wells up; the Gurmukhs
        take the Support of the Naam.  || 4 ||   In an instant, one is
        born, and in an instant, one dies. In an instant one comes, and
        in an instant one goes. One who recognizes the Shabad merges into
        it, and is not afflicted by death. </p>

      <p> Our Lord and Master is Unweighable; He cannot be weighed. He cannot
        be found merely by talking.  || 5 ||   The merchants and the traders
        have come; their profits are pre-ordained. Those who practice
        Truth reap the profits, abiding in the Will of God. With the Merchandise
        of Truth, they meet the Guru, who does not have a trace of greed.
        || 6 ||   As Gurmukh, they are weighed and measured, in the balance
        and the scales of Truth. The enticements of hope and desire are
        quieted by the Guru, whose Word is True. He Himself weighs with
        the scale; perfect is the weighing of the Perfect One.  || 7 ||
        No one is saved by mere talk and speech, nor by reading loads
        of books. The body does not obtain purity without loving devotion
        to the Lord. O Nanak, never forget the Naam; the Guru shall unite
        us with the Creator.  || 8 || 9 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:
        Meeting the Perfect True Guru, we find the jewel of meditative
        reflection. Surrendering our minds to our Guru, we find universal
        love. We find the wealth of liberation, and our demerits are erased.
        || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, without the Guru, there is no
        spiritual wisdom. Go and ask Brahma, Naarad and Vyaas, the writer
        of the Vedas.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Know that from the vibration
        of the Word, we obtain spiritual wisdom and meditation. Through
        it, we speak the Unspoken. He is the fruit-bearing Tree, luxuriantly
        green with abundant shade. The rubies, jewels and emeralds are
        in the Guru's Treasury.  || 2 ||   From the Guru's Treasury,
        we receive the Love of the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        We gather in the True Merchandise, through the Perfect Grace of
        the Infinite. The True Guru is the Giver of peace, the Dispeller
        of pain, the Destroyer of demons.  || 3 ||   The terrifying world-ocean
        is difficult and dreadful; there is no shore on this side or the
        one beyond. There is no boat, no raft, no oars and no boatman.
        The True Guru is the only boat on this terrifying ocean. His Glance
        of Grace carries us across.  || 4 ||   If I forget my Beloved,
        even for an instant, suffering overtakes me and peace departs.
        Let that tongue be burnt in flames, which does not chant the Naam
        with love. When the pitcher of the body bursts, there is terrible
        pain; those who are caught by the Minister of Death regret and
        repent.  || 5 ||   Crying out, &quot;Mine! Mine!&quot;, they have
        departed, but their bodies, their wealth, and their wives did
        not go with them. Without the Name, wealth is useless; deceived
        by wealth, they have lost their way. So serve the True Lord; become
        Gurmukh, and speak the Unspoken.  || 6 ||   Coming and going,
        people wander through reincarnation; they act according to their
        past actions. How can one's pre-ordained destiny be erased?
        It is written in accordance with the Lord's Will. Without
        the Name of the Lord, no one can be saved. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, we are united in His Union.  || 7 ||   Without Him,
        I have no one to call my own. My soul and my breath of life belong
        to Him. May my egotism and possessiveness be burnt to ashes, and
        my greed and egotistical pride consigned to the fire. O Nanak,
        contemplating the Shabad, the Treasure of Excellence is obtained.
        || 8 || 10 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  O mind, love the Lord,
        as the lotus loves the water. Tossed about by the waves, it still
        blossoms with love. </p>

      <p> In the water, the creatures are created; outside of the water
        they die.  || 1 ||   O mind, how can you be saved without love?
        God permeates the inner beings of the Gurmukhs. They are blessed
        with the treasure of devotion.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O mind, love
        the Lord, as the fish loves the water. The more the water, the
        more the happiness, and the greater the peace of mind and body.
        Without water, she cannot live, even for an instant. God knows
        the suffering of her mind.  || 2 ||   O mind, love the Lord, as
        the song-bird loves the rain. The pools are overflowing with water,
        and the land is luxuriantly green, but what are they to her, if
        that single drop of rain does not fall into her mouth? By His
        Grace, she receives it; otherwise, because of her past actions,
        she gives her head.  || 3 ||   O mind, love the Lord, as the water
        loves the milk. The water, added to the milk, itself bears the
        heat, and prevents the milk from burning. God unites the separated
        ones with Himself again, and blesses them with true greatness.
        || 4 ||   O mind, love the Lord, as the chakvee duck loves the
        sun. She does not sleep, for an instant or a moment; the sun is
        so far away, but she thinks that it is near. Understanding does
        not come to the self-willed manmukh. But to the Gurmukh, the Lord
        is always close.  || 5 ||   The self-willed manmukhs make their
        calculations and plans, but only the actions of the Creator come
        to pass. His Value cannot be estimated, even though everyone may
        wish to do so. Through the Guru's Teachings, it is revealed. Meeting
        with the True One, peace is found.  || 6 ||   True love shall
        not be broken, if the True Guru is met. Obtaining the wealth of
        spiritual wisdom, the understanding of the three worlds is acquired.
        So become a customer of merit, and do not forget the Immaculate
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 7 ||   Those birds which peck
        at the shore of the pool have played and have departed. In a moment,
        in an instant, we too must depart. Our play is only for today
        or tomorrow. But those whom You unite, Lord, are united with You;
        they obtain a seat in the Arena of Truth.  || 8 ||   Without the
        Guru, love does not well up, and the filth of egotism does not
        depart. One who recognizes within himself that, &quot;He is me&quot;,
        and who is pierced through by the Shabad, is satisfied. When one
        becomes Gurmukh and realizes his own self, what more is there
        left to do or have done?  || 9 ||   Why speak of union to those
        who are already united with the Lord? Receiving the Shabad, they
        are satisfied. The self-willed manmukhs do not understand; separated
        from Him, they endure beatings. O Nanak, there is only the one
        door to His Home; there is no other place at all.  || 10 || 11
        ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  The self-willed manmukhs wander
        around, deluded and deceived. They find no place of rest. Without
        the Guru, no one is shown the Way. Like the blind, they continue
        coming and going. Having lost the treasure of spiritual wisdom,
        they depart, defrauded and plundered.  || 1 ||   O Baba, Maya
        deceives with its illusion. Deceived by doubt, the discarded bride
        is not received into the Lap of her Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   The deceived bride wanders around in foreign lands; she leaves,
        and abandons her own home. Deceived, she climbs the plateaus and
        mountains; her mind wavers in doubt. Separated from the Primal
        Being, how can she meet with Him again? Plundered by pride, she
        cries out and bewails.  || 2 ||   The Guru unites the separated
        ones with the Lord again, through the love of the Delicious Name
        of the Lord. </p>

      <p> Through truth and intuitive poise, great honor is obtained, with
        the Support of the Naam and the Glory of the Lord. As it pleases
        You, Lord, please save and protect me. Without You, O my Husband
        Lord, who else is there for me?  || 3 ||   Reading their books
        over and over again, people continue making mistakes; they are
        so proud of their religious robes. But what is the use of bathing
        at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, when the filth of stubborn pride
        is within the mind? Other than the Guru, who can explain that
        within the mind is the Lord, the King, the Emperor?  || 4 || 
        The Treasure of the Lord's Love is obtained by the Gurmukh,
        who contemplates the essence of reality. The bride eradicates
        her selfishness, and adorns herself with the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. Within her own home, she finds her Husband, through infinite
        love for the Guru.  || 5 ||   Applying oneself to the service
        of the Guru, the mind is purified, and peace is obtained. The
        Word of the Guru's Shabad abides within the mind, and egotism
        is eliminated from within. The Treasure of the Naam is acquired,
        and the mind reaps the lasting profit.  || 6 ||   If He grants
        His Grace, then we obtain it. We cannot find it by our own efforts.
        Remain attached to the Feet of the Guru, and eradicate selfishness
        from within. Attuned to Truth, you shall obtain the True One.
        || 7 ||   Everyone makes mistakes; only the Guru and the Creator
        are infallible. One who instructs his mind with the Guru's
        Teachings comes to embrace love for the Lord. O Nanak, do not
        forget the Truth; you shall receive the Infinite Word of the Shabad.
        || 8 || 12 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  The enticing desire
        for Maya leads people to become emotionally attached to their
        children, relatives, households and spouses. The world is deceived
        and plundered by riches, youth, greed and egotism. The drug of
        emotional attachment has destroyed me, as it has destroyed the
        whole world.  || 1 ||   O my Beloved, I have no one except You.
        Without You, nothing else pleases me. Loving You, I am at peace.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I sing the Praises of the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, with love; I am content with the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. Whatever is seen shall pass away. So do not be attached
        to this false show. Like a traveller in his travels, you have
        come. Behold the caravan leaving each day.  || 2 ||   Many preach
        sermons, but without the Guru, understanding is not obtained.
        If someone receives the Glory of the Naam, he is attuned to truth
        and blessed with honor. Those who are pleasing to You are good;
        no one is counterfeit or genuine.  || 3 ||   In the Guru's
        Sanctuary we are saved. The assets of the self-willed manmukhs
        are false. The eight metals of the King are made into coins by
        the Word of His Shabad. The Assayer Himself assays them, and He
        places the genuine ones in His Treasury.  || 4 ||   Your Value
        cannot be appraised; I have seen and tested everything. By speaking,
        His Depth cannot be found. Abiding in truth, honor is obtained.
        Through the Guru's Teachings, I praise You; otherwise, I cannot
        describe Your Value.  || 5 ||   That body which does not appreciate
        the Naam - that body is infested with egotism and conflict.
        Without the Guru, spiritual wisdom is not obtained; other tastes
        are poison. Without virtue, nothing is of any use. The taste of
        Maya is bland and insipid.  || 6 ||   Through desire, people are
        cast into the womb and reborn. Through desire, they taste the
        sweet and sour flavors. Bound by desire, they are led on, beaten
        and struck on their faces and mouths. Bound and gagged and assaulted
        by evil, they are released only through the Name, through the
        Guru's Teachings. </p>

      <p> || 7 ||   In all places, You are the One and Only. As it pleases
        You, Lord, please save and protect me! Through the Guru's Teachings,
        the True One abides within the mind. The Companionship of the
        Naam brings the most excellent honor. Eradicate the disease of
        egotism, and chant the True Shabad, the Word of the True Lord.
        || 8 ||   You are pervading throughout the Akaashic Ethers, the
        nether regions and the three worlds. You Yourself are bhakti,
        loving devotional worship. You Yourself unite us in Union with
        Yourself. O Nanak, may I never forget the Naam! As is Your Pleasure,
        so is Your Will.  || 9 || 13 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  My
        mind is pierced through by the Name of the Lord. What else should
        I contemplate? Focusing your awareness on the Shabad, happiness
        wells up. Attuned to God, the most excellent peace is found. As
        it pleases You, please save me, Lord. The Name of the Lord is
        my Support.  || 1 ||   O mind, the Will of our Lord and Master
        is true. Focus your love upon the One who created and adorned
        your body and mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If I cut my body into
        pieces, and burn them in the fire, and if I make my body and mind
        into firewood, and night and day burn them in the fire, and if
        I perform hundreds of thousands and millions of religious rituals - still,
        all these are not equal to the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   If
        my body were cut in half, if a saw was put to my head, and if
        my body were frozen in the Himalayas - even then, my mind would
        not be free of disease. None of these are equal to the Name of
        the Lord. I have seen and tried and tested them all.  || 3 ||
        If I made a donation of castles of gold, and gave lots of fine
        horses and wondrous elephants in charity, and if I made donations
        of land and cows - even then, pride and ego would still be
        within me. The Name of the Lord has pierced my mind; the Guru
        has given me this true gift.  || 4 ||   There are so many stubborn-minded
        intelligent people, and so many who contemplate the Vedas. There
        are so many entanglements for the soul. Only as Gurmukh do we
        find the Gate of Liberation. Truth is higher than everything;
        but higher still is truthful living.  || 5 ||   Call everyone
        exalted; no one seems lowly. The One Lord has fashioned the vessels,
        and His One Light pervades the three worlds. Receiving His Grace,
        we obtain Truth. No one can erase His Primal Blessing.  || 6 ||
        When one Holy person meets another Holy person, they abide in
        contentment, through the Love of the Guru. They contemplate the
        Unspoken Speech, merging in absorption in the True Guru. Drinking
        in the Ambrosial Nectar, they are contented; they go to the Court
        of the Lord in robes of honor.  || 7 ||   In each and every heart
        the Music of the Lord's Flute vibrates, night and day, with
        sublime love for the Shabad. Only those few who become Gurmukh
        understand this by instructing their minds. O Nanak, do not forget
        the Naam. Practicing the Shabad you shall be saved.  || 8 || 14
        ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  There are painted mansions to behold,
        white-washed, with beautiful doors; they were constructed to give
        pleasure to the mind, but this is only for the sake of the love
        of duality. The inner being is empty without love. The body shall
        crumble into a heap of ashes.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny,
        this body and wealth shall not go along with you. The Lord's
        Name is the pure wealth; through the Guru, God bestows this gift.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord's Name is the pure wealth;
        it is given only by the Giver. One who has the Guru, the Creator,
        as his Friend, shall not be questioned hereafter. He Himself delivers
        those who are delivered. </p>

      <p> He Himself is the Forgiver.  || 2 ||   The self-willed manmukh
        looks upon his daughters, sons and relatives as his own. Gazing
        upon his wife, he is pleased. But along with happiness, they bring
        grief. The Gurmukhs are attuned to the Word of the Shabad. Day
        and night, they enjoy the Sublime Essence of the Lord.  || 3 ||
        The consciousness of the wicked, faithless cynics wanders around
        in search of transitory wealth, unstable and distracted. Searching
        outside of themselves, they are ruined; the object of their search
        is in that sacred place within the home of the heart. The self-willed
        manmukhs, in their ego, miss it; the Gurmukhs receive it in their
        laps.  || 4 ||   You worthless, faithless cynic - recognize
        your own origin! This body is made of blood and semen. It shall
        be consigned to the fire in the end. The body is under the power
        of the breath, according to the True Sign inscribed upon your
        forehead.  || 5 ||   Everyone begs for a long life - no one
        wishes to die. A life of peace and comfort comes to that Gurmukh,
        within whom God dwells. Without the Naam, what good those who
        do not have the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of the Lord and Guru?
        || 6 ||   In their dreams at night, people wander around as long
        as they sleep; just so, they are under the power of the snake
        Maya, as long as their hearts are filled with ego and duality.
        Through the Guru's Teachings, they come to understand and see
        that this world is just a dream.  || 7 ||   As thirst is quenched
        with water, and the baby is satisfied with mother's milk,
        and as the lotus does not exist without water, and as the fish
        dies without water - O Nanak, so does the Gurmukh live, receiving
        the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 8 || 15 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL:  Beholding
        the terrifying mountain in this world of my father's home,
        I am terrified. It is so difficult to climb this high mountain;
        there is no ladder which reaches up there. But as Gurmukh, I know
        that it is within my self; the Guru has brought me to Union, and
        so I cross over.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, the terrifying
        world-ocean is so difficult to cross - I am terrified! The
        Perfect True Guru, in His Pleasure, has met with me; the Guru
        has saved me, through the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        I may say, &quot;I am going, I am going&quot;, but I know that,
        in the end, I must really go. Whoever comes must also go. Only
        the Guru and the Creator are Eternal. So praise the True One continually,
        and love His Place of Truth.  || 2 ||   Beautiful gates, houses
        and palaces, solidly built forts, elephants, saddled horses, hundreds
        of thousands of uncounted armies - none of these will go along
        with anyone in the end, and yet, the fools bother themselves to
        exhaustion with these, and then die.  || 3 ||   You may gather
        gold and sliver, but wealth is just a net of entanglement. You
        may beat the drum and proclaim authority over the whole world,
        but without the Name, death hovers over your head. When the body
        falls, the play of life is over; what shall be the condition of
        the evil-doers then?  || 4 ||   The husband is delighted seeing
        his sons, and his wife upon his bed. He applies sandalwood and
        scented oils, and dresses himself in his beautiful clothes. But
        dust shall mix with dust, and he shall depart, leaving hearth
        and home behind.  || 5 ||   He may be called a chief, an emperor,
        a king, a governor or a lord; he may present himself as a leader
        or a chief, but this just burns him in the fire of egotistical
        pride. The self-willed manmukh has forgotten the Naam. He is like
        straw, burning in the forest fire.  || 6 ||   Whoever comes into
        the world and indulges in ego, must depart. </p>

      <p> The whole world is a store-house of lamp-black; the body and mind
        are blackened with it. Those who are saved by the Guru are immaculate
        and pure; through the Word of the Shabad, they extinguish the
        fire of desire.  || 7 ||   O Nanak, they swim across with the
        True Name of the Lord, the King above the heads of kings. May
        I never forget the Name of the Lord! I have purchased the Jewel
        of the Lord's Name. The self-willed manmukhs putrefy and
        die in the terrifying world-ocean, while the Gurmukhs cross over
        the bottomless ocean.  || 8 || 16 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,
        SECOND HOUSE:  They have made this their resting place and they
        sit at home, but the urge to depart is always there. This would
        be known as a lasting place of rest, only if they were to remain
        stable and unchanging.  || 1 ||   What sort of a resting place
        is this world? Doing deeds of faith, pack up the supplies for
        your journey, and remain committed to the Name.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Yogis sit in their Yogic postures, and the Mullahs sit
        at their resting stations. The Hindu Pandits recite from their
        books, and the Siddhas sit in the temples of their gods.  || 2
        ||   The angels, Siddhas, worshippers of Shiva, heavenly musicians,
        silent sages, Saints, priests, preachers, spiritual teachers and
        commanders - each and every one has left, and all others shall
        depart as well.  || 3 ||   The sultans and kings, the rich and
        the mighty, have marched away in succession. In a moment or two,
        we shall also depart. O my heart, understand that you must go
        as well!  || 4 ||   This is described in the Shabads; only a few
        understand this! Nanak offers this prayer to the One who pervades
        the water, the land and the air.  || 5 ||   He is Allah, the Unknowable,
        the Inaccessible, All-powerful and Merciful Creator. All the world
        comes and goes - only the Merciful Lord is permanent.  || 6
        ||   Call permanent only the One, who does not have destiny inscribed
        upon His Forehead. The sky and the earth shall pass away; He alone
        is permanent.  || 7 ||   The day and the sun shall pass away;
        the night and the moon shall pass away; the hundreds of thousands
        of stars shall disappear. He alone is permanent; Nanak speaks
        the Truth.  || 8 || 17 ||   SEVENTEEN ASHTAPADEES OF THE FIRST

        SIREE RAAG,  THIRD MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  ASHTAPADEES:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> By God's Grace, the Gurmukh practices devotion; without the
        Guru, there is no devotional worship. One who merges his own self
        into Him understands, and so becomes pure. The Dear Lord is True,
        and True is the Word of His Bani. Through the Word of the Shabad,
        Union with Him is obtained.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny,
        without devotion, why have people even come into the world? They
        have not served the Perfect Guru; they have wasted their lives
        in vain.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord Himself, the Life of the
        World, is the Giver. He Himself forgives, and unites us with Himself.
        What are these poor beings and creatures? What can they speak
        and say? God Himself grants glory to the Gurmukhs; He joins them
        to His Service.  || 2 ||   Beholding your family, you are lured
        away by emotional attachment, but when you leave, they will not
        go with you. <br>
