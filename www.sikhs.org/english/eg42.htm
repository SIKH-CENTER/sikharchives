      <p> In the ecstasy of the Lord's Praises, they obtain supreme
        joy, and forget all their sorrows. The brilliant flash of the
        One Lord is revealed to them  -  they behold Him in the ten
        directions. Prays Nanak, I meditate on the Lord's lotus feet;
        the Lord is the Lover of His devotees; this is His natural way.
        || 4 || 3 || 6 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Husband Lord of
        the Saints is eternal; He does not die or go away. She, whose
        home is blessed by her Husband Lord, enjoys Him forever. God is
        eternal and immortal, forever young and immaculately pure. He
        is not far away, He is ever-present; the Lord and Master fills
        the ten directions, forever and ever. He is the Lord of souls,
        the source of salvation and wisdom. The Love of my Dear Beloved
        is pleasing to me. Nanak speaks what the Guru's Teachings
        have led him to know. The Husband Lord of the Saints is eternal;
        He does not die or go away.  || 1 ||   One who has the Lord as
        her Husband enjoys great bliss. That soul-bride is happy, and
        her glory is perfect. She obtains honor, greatness and happiness,
        singing the Praise of the Lord. God, the Great Being, is always
        with her. She attains total perfection and the nine treasures;
        her home lacks nothing.  -  everything is there. Her speech
        is so sweet; she obeys her Beloved Lord; her marriage is permanent
        and everlasting. Nanak chants what he knows through the Guru's
        Teachings: One who has the Lord as her Husband enjoys great bliss.
        || 2 ||   Come, O my companions, let us dedicate ourselves to
        serving the Saints. Let us grind their corn, wash their feet and
        so renounce our self-conceit. Let us shed our egos, and our troubles
        shall be removed; let us not display ourselves. Let us take to
        His Sanctuary and obey Him, and be happy with whatever He does.
        Let us become the slaves of His slaves, and shed our sadness,
        and with our palms pressed together, remain wakeful day and night.
        Nanak chants what he knows through the Guru's Teachings;
        come, O my companions, let us dedicate ourselves to serving the
        Saints.  || 3 ||   One who has such good destiny written upon
        his forehead, dedicates himself to His service. One who attains
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, has his desires fulfilled.
        In the Saadh Sangat, immerse yourself in the Love of the Lord;
        remember the Lord of the Universe in meditation. Doubt, emotional
        attachment, sin and duality  -  he renounces them all. Peace,
        poise and tranquility fill his mind, and he sings the Lord's
        Glorious Praises with joy and delight. Nanak chants what he knows
        through the Guru's Teachings: one who has such good destiny
        written upon his forehead, dedicates himself to His service. 
        || 4 || 4 || 7 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  SHALOK:  If you chant
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the Messenger of Death
        will have nothing to say to you. O Nanak, the mind and body will
        be at peace, and in the end, you shall merge with the Lord of
        the world.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  Let me join the Society of the
        Saints  -  save me, Lord! With my palms pressed together, I
        offer my prayer: give me Your Name, O Lord, Har, Har. I beg for
        the Lord's Name, and fall at His feet; I renounce my self-conceit,
        by Your kindness. I shall not wander anywhere else, but take to
        Your Sanctuary. O God, embodiment of mercy, have mercy on me.
        O all-powerful, indescribable, infinite and immaculate Lord Master,
        listen to this, my prayer. With palms pressed together, Nanak
        begs for this blessing: O Lord, let my cycle of birth and death
        come to an end.  || </p>

      <p> 1 ||   I am a sinner, devoid of wisdom, worthless, destitute and
        vile. I am deceitful, hard-hearted, lowly and entangled in the
        mud of emotional attachment. I am stuck in the filth of doubt
        and egotistical actions, and I try not to think of death. In ignorance,
        I cling to the pleasures of woman and the joys of Maya. My youth
        is wasting away, old age is approaching, and Death, my companion,
        is counting my days. Prays Nanak, my hope is in You, Lord; please
        preserve me, the lowly one, in the Sanctuary of the Holy.  ||
        2 ||   I have wandered through countless incarnations, suffering
        terrible pain in these lives. I am entangled in sweet pleasures
        and gold. After wandering around with such great loads of sin,
        I have come, after wandering through so many foreign lands. Now,
        I have taken the protection of God, and I have found total peace
        in the Name of the Lord. God, my Beloved, is my protector; nothing
        was done, or will ever be done, by myself alone. I have found
        peace, poise and bliss, O Nanak; by Your mercy, I swim across
        the world-ocean.  || 3 ||   You saved those who only pretended
        to believe, so what doubts should Your true devotees have? By
        every means possible, listen to the Praises of the Lord with your
        ears. Listen with your ears to the Word of the Lord's Bani,
        the hymns of spiritual wisdom; thus you shall obtain the treasure
        in your mind. Attuned to the Love of the Lord God, the Architect
        of Destiny, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. The earth is
        the paper, the forest is the pen and the wind is the writer, but
        still, the end of the endless Lord cannot be found. O Nanak, I
        have taken to the Sanctuary of His lotus feet.  || 4 || 5 || 8
        ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Primal Lord is the Lord God of all
        beings. I have taken to His Sanctuary. My life has become fearless,
        and all my anxieties have been removed. I know the Lord as my
        mother, father, son, friend, well-wisher and close relative. The
        Guru has led me to embrace Him; the Saints chant His Pure Praises.
        His Glorious Virtues are infinite, and His greatness is unlimited.
        His value cannot be described at all. God is the One and only,
        the Unseen Lord and Master; O Nanak, I have grasped His protection.
        || 1 ||   The world is a pool of nectar, when the Lord becomes
        our helper. One who wears the necklace of the Lord's Name
        -  his days of suffering are ended. His state of doubt, attachment
        and sin is erased, and the cycle of reincarnation into the womb
        is totally ended. The ocean of fire becomes cool, when one grasps
        the hem of the robe of the Holy Saint. The Lord of the Universe,
        the Sustainer of the World, the merciful all-powerful Lord  - 
        the Holy Saints proclaim the victory of the Lord. O Nanak, meditating
        on the Naam, in the perfect Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        I have obtained the supreme status.  || 2 ||   Wherever I look,
        there I find the One Lord permeating and pervading all. In each
        and every heart, He Himself dwells, but how rare is that person
        who realizes this. The Lord is permeating and pervading the water,
        the land and the sky; He is contained in the ant and the elephant.
        In the beginning, in the middle and in the end, He exists. By
        Guru's Grace, He is known. God created the expanse of the
        universe, God created the play of the world. His humble servants
        call Him the Lord of the Universe, the treasure of virtue. Meditate
        in remembrance on the Lord Master, the Searcher of hearts; O Nanak,
        He is the One, pervading and permeating all.  || 3 || </p>

      <p> Day and night, become beauteous by remembering the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. In love with the Lord's Lotus Feet, corruption
        and sin depart. Pain, hunger and poverty run away, and the path
        is clearly revealed. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, one is attuned to the Naam, and obtains the desires
        of the mind. Beholding the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan,
        desires are fulfilled; all one's family and relatives are
        saved. Day and night, he is in bliss, night and day, remembering
        the Lord in meditation, O Nanak.  || 4 || 6 || 9 || </p>

        AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  CHHANT,  SEVENTH HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> SHALOK:  It is the most sublime contemplation, to speak of the
        Lord of the Universe in the pure Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy. O Nanak, never the Naam, even for a moment; bless me
        with Your Grace, Lord God!  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  The night is wet
        with dew, and the stars twinkle in the heavens. The Saints remain
        wakeful; they are the Beloveds of my Lord. The Beloveds of the
        Lord remain ever wakeful, remembering the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, day and night. In their hearts, they meditate on the lotus
        feet of God; they do not forget Him, even for an instant. They
        renounce their pride, emotional attachment and mental corruption,
        and burn away the pain of wickedness. Prays Nanak, the Saints,
        the beloved servants of the Lord, remain ever wakeful.  || 1 ||
        My bed is adorned in splendor. My mind is filled with bliss,
        since I heard that God is coming. Meeting God, the Lord and Master,
        I have entered the realm of peace; I am filled with joy and delight.
        He is joined to me, in my very fiber; my sorrows have departed,
        and my body, mind and soul are all rejuvenated. I have obtained
        the fruits of my mind's desires, meditating on God; the day
        of my wedding is auspicious. Prays Nanak, when I meet the Lord
        of excellence, I came to experience all pleasure and bliss.  ||
        2 ||   I meet with my companions and say, &quot;Show me the insignia
        of my Husband Lord.&quot; I am filled with the sublime essence
        of His Love, and I do not know how to say anything. The Glorious
        Virtues of the Creator are profound, mysterious and infinite;
        even the Vedas cannot find His limits. With loving devotion, I
        meditate on the Lord Master, and sing the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord forever. Filled with all virtues and spiritual wisdom,
        I have become pleasing to my God. Prays Nanak, imbued with the
        color of the Lord's Love, I am imperceptibly absorbed into
        Him.  || 3 ||   When I began to sing the songs of rejoicing to
        the Lord, my friends became glad, and my troubles and enemies
        departed. My peace and happiness increased; I rejoiced in the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, and God Himself blessed me with His
        mercy. I have grasped the Lord's feet, and remaining ever
        wakeful, I have met the Lord, the Creator. The appointed day came,
        and I attained peace and poise; all treasures are in the feet
        of God. Prays Nanak, the Lord's humble servants always seek
        the Sanctuary of the Lord and Master.  || 4 || 1 || 10 ||   AASAA,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Rise up and go forth, O traveller; why do you delay?
        Your allotted time is now complete  -  why are you engrossed
        in falsehood? You desire that which is false; deceived by Maya,
        you commit innumerable sins. Your body shall become a pile of
        dust; the Messenger of Death has spotted you, and will conquer
        you. </p>

      <p> Abandoning your wealth and youth, you will have to leave, without
        any food or clothing. O Nanak, only your actions shall go with
        you; the consequences of your actions cannot be erased.  || 1
        ||   Like the deer, captured on a moon-lit night, so does the
        constant commission of sins turn pleasure into pain. The sins
        you have committed shall not leave you; placing the noose around
        your neck, they shall lead you away. Beholding an illusion, you
        are deceived, and on your bed, you enjoy a false lover. You are
        intoxicated with greed, avarice and egotism; you are engrossed
        in self-conceit. O Nanak, like the deer, you are being destroyed
        by your ignorance; your comings and goings shall never end.  ||
        2 ||   The fly is caught in the sweet candy  -  how can it
        fly away? The elephant has fallen into the pit  -  how can
        it escape? It shall be so difficult to swim across, for one who
        does not remember the Lord and Master, even for an instant. His
        sufferings and punishments are beyond reckoning; he receives the
        consequences of his own actions. His secret deeds are exposed,
        and he is ruined here and hereafter. O Nanak, without the True
        Guru, the self-willed egotistical manmukh is defrauded.  || 3
        ||   The Lord's slaves live by holding on to God's feet.
        The Lord and Master embraces those who seek His Sanctuary. He
        blesses them with power, wisdom, knowledge and meditation; He
        Himself inspires them to chant His Name. He Himself is the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and He Himself saves the world.
        The Preserver preserves those whose actions are always pure. O
        Nanak, they never have to go to hell; the Lord's Saints are
        under the Lord's Protection.  || 4 || 2 || 11 ||   AASAA,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Be gone, O my laziness, that I may pray to the Lord.
        I enjoy my Husband Lord, and look beautiful with my God. I look
        beautiful in the Company of my Husband Lord; I enjoy my Lord Master
        day and night. I live by remembering God with each and every breath,
        beholding the Lord, and singing His Glorious Praises. The pain
        of separation has grown shy, for I have obtained the Blessed Vision
        of His Darshan; His Ambrosial Glance of Grace has filled me with
        bliss. Prays Nanak, my desires are fulfilled; I have met the One
        I was seeking.  || 1 ||   Run away, O sins; the Creator has entered
        my home. The demons within me have been burnt; the Lord of the
        Universe has revealed Himself to me. The Beloved Lord of the Universe,
        the Lord of the World has revealed Himself; in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, I chant His Name. I have seen the Wondrous
        Lord; He showers His Ambrosial Nectar upon me, and by Guru's
        Grace, I know Him. My mind is at peace, resounding with the music
        of bliss; the Lord's limits cannot be found. Prays Nanak,
        God brings us to union with Himself, in the poise of celestial
        peace.  || 2 ||   They do not have to see hell, if they remember
        the Lord in meditation. The Righteous Judge of Dharma applauds
        them, and the Messenger of Death runs away from them. Dharmic
        faith, patience, peace and poise are obtained by vibrating upon
        the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Showering
        His Blessings, He saves those who renounce all attachments and
        egotism. The Lord embraces us; the Guru unites us with Him. Meditating
        on the Lord of the Universe, we are satisfied. </p>

      <p> Prays Nanak, remembering the Lord and Master in meditation, all
        hopes are fulfilled.  || 3 ||   Grasping the Lord's Feet,
        the treasure of the Siddhas, what suffering can I feel? Everything
        is in His Power  -  He is my God. Holding me the the arm, He
        blesses me with His Name; placing His Hand upon my forehead, He
        saves me. The world-ocean does not trouble me, for I have drunk
        the sublime elixir of the Lord. In the Saadh Sangat, imbued with
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I am victorious on the great battlefield
        of life. Prays Nanak, I have entered the Sanctuary of the Lord
        and Master; the Messenger of Death shall not destroy me again.
        || 4 || 3 || 12 ||   AASAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those actions you perform,
        day and night, are recorded upon your forehead. And the One, from
        whom you hide these actions  -  He sees them, and is always
        with you. The Creator Lord is with you; He sees you, so why commit
        sins? So perform good deeds, and chant the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord; you shall never have to go to hell. Twenty-four hours a
        day, dwell upon the Lord's Name in meditation; it alone shall
        go along with you. So vibrate continually in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, and the sins you committed shall
        be erased.  || 1 ||   Practicing deceit, you fill your belly,
        you ignorant fool! The Lord, the Great Giver, continues to give
        you everything. The Great Giver is always merciful. Why should
        we forget the Lord Master from our minds? Join the Saadh Sangat,
        and vibrate fearlessly; all your relations shall be saved. The
        Siddhas, the seekers, the demi-gods, the silent sages and the
        devotees, all take the Naam as their support. Prays Nanak, vibrate
        continually upon God, the One Creator Lord.  || 2 ||   Do not
        practice deception  -  God is the Assayer of all. Those who
        practice falsehood and deceit are reincarnated in the world. Those
        who meditate on the One Lord, cross over the world-ocean. Renouncing
        sexual desire, anger, flattery and slander, they enter the Sanctuary
        of God. The lofty, inaccessible and infinite Lord and Master is
        pervading the water, the land and the sky. Prays Nanak, He is
        the support of His servants; His Lotus Feet are their only sustenance.
        || 3 ||   Behold  -  the world is a mirage; nothing here is
        permanent. The pleasures of Maya which are here, shall not go
        with you. The Lord, your companion, is always with you; remember
        Him day and night. Without the One Lord, there is no other; burn
        away the love of duality. Know in your mind, that the One God
        is your friend, youth, wealth and everything. Prays Nanak, by
        great good fortune, we find the Lord, and merge in peace and celestial
        poise.  || 4 || 4 || 13 || </p>

      <p> The days of your life are being consumed; they are passing away
        without God. So meet God, the Merciful Lord. I passed through
        so many births and deaths; without Union with the Beloved, I did
        not obtain salvation. I am without the status of high birth, beauty,
        glory or spiritual wisdom; without You, who is mine, O Mother?

        I have enshrined love for my Beloved. In order to meet Him, I
        have become a renunciate. Cursed is that body which remains without
        Him, even for an instant. My eyelids do not close, for I am absorbed
        in the love of my Beloved. Day and night, my mind thinks only
        of God. Attuned to the Lord, intoxicated with the Naam, fear,
        doubt and duality have all left me. Bestow Your mercy and compassion,
        O merciful and perfect Lord, that Nanak may be intoxicated with
        Your Love.  || 2 ||   The bumble-bee is buzzing  -  the bumble-bee
        is buzzing, intoxicated with the honey, the flavor and the fragrance;
        because of its love for the lotus, it entangles itself. The mind
        of the sparrow-hawk thirsts  -  the mind of the sparrow-hawk
        thirsts; its mind longs for the beautiful rain-drops from the
        clouds. Drinking them in, its fever departs. O Destroyer of fever,
        Remover of pain, please unite me with You. My mind and body have
        such great love for You. O my beautiful, wise and all-knowing
        Lord and Master, with what tongue should I chant Your Praises?
        Take me by the arm, and grant me Your Name. One who is blessed
        with Your Glance of Grace, has his sins erased. Nanak meditates
        on the Lord, the Purifier of sinners; beholding His Vision, he
        suffers no more.  || 3 ||   I focus my consciousness on the Lord
        -  I focus my consciousness upon the Lord; I am helpless  - 
        please, keep me under Your Protection. I yearn to meet You, my
        soul hungers for You. I meditate on Your beautiful body  - 
        I meditate on Your beautiful body; my mind is fascinated by Your
        spiritual wisdom, O Lord of the world. Please, preserve the honor
        of Your humble servants and beggars. God bestows perfect honor
        and destroys pain; He has fulfilled all my desires. How very blessed
        was that day when the Lord embraced me; meeting my Husband Lord,
        my bed was beautified. When God granted His Grace and met me,
        all my sins were erased. Prays Nanak, my hopes are fulfilled;
        I have met the Lord, the Lord of Lakshmi, the treasure of excellence.

        thousand suns appeared, even with such light, there would still
        be pitch darkness without the Guru.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  O
        Nanak, those who do not think of the Guru, and who think of themselves
        as clever, shall be left abandoned in the field, like the scattered
        sesame. They are abandoned in the field, says Nanak, and they
        have a hundred masters to please. The wretches bear fruit and
        flower, but within their bodies, they are filled with ashes. 
        || 3 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself created Himself; He Himself assumed
        His Name. Secondly, He fashioned the creation; seated within the
        creation, He beholds it with delight. You Yourself are the Giver

        are the Knower of all; You give life, and take it away again with
        a word. Seated within the creation, You behold it with delight.

        Your solar Systems. True are Your realms, True is Your creation.
        True are Your actions, and all Your deliberations. True is Your
        Command, and True is Your Court. True is the Command of Your Will,
        True is Your Order. True is Your Mercy, True is Your Insignia.
        Hundreds of thousands and millions call You True. In the True
        Lord is all power, in the True Lord is all might. True is Your
        Praise, True is Your Adoration. True is Your almighty creative
        power, True King. O Nanak, true are those who meditate on the
        True One.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Great is His greatness, as great
        as His Name. Great is His greatness, as True is His justice. Great
        is His greatness, as permanent as His Throne. Great is His greatness,
        as He knows our utterances. Great is His greatness, as He understands
        all our affections. Great is His greatness, as He gives without
        being asked. Great is His greatness, as He Himself is all-in-all.
        O Nanak, His actions cannot be described. Whatever He has done,
        or will do, is all by His Own Will.  || 2 ||   SECOND MEHL:  This
        world is the room of the True Lord; within it is the dwelling
        of the True Lord. By His Command, some are merged into Him, and
        some, by His Command, are destroyed. Some, by the Pleasure of
        His Will, are lifted up out of Maya, while others are made to
        dwell within it. No one can say who will be rescued. O Nanak,
        he alone is known as Gurmukh, unto whom the Lord reveals Himself.
        || 3 ||   PAUREE:  O Nanak, having created the souls, the Lord
        installed the Righteous Judge of Dharma to read and record their
        accounts. There, only the Truth is judged true; the sinners are
        picked out and separated. The false find no place there, and they
        go to hell with their faces blackened. Those who are imbued with
        Your Name win, while the cheaters lose. The Lord installed the
        Righteous Judge of Dharma to read and record the accounts.  ||

      <p> Wonderful is the wind, wonderful is the water. Wonderful is fire,
        which works wonders. Wonderful is the earth, wonderful the sources
        of creation. Wonderful are the tastes to which mortals are attached.

        hunger, wonderful is satisfaction. Wonderful is His Praise, wonderful
        is His adoration. Wonderful is the wilderness, wonderful is the
        path. Wonderful is closeness, wonderful is distance. How wonderful
        to behold the Lord, ever-present here. Beholding His wonders,
        I am wonder-struck. O Nanak, those who understand this are blessed
        with perfect destiny.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  By His Power we
        see, by His Power we hear; by His Power we have fear, and the
        essence of happiness. By His Power the nether worlds exist, and
        the Akaashic ethers; by His Power the entire creation exists.
        By His Power the Vedas and the Puraanas exist, and the Holy Scriptures
        of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic religions. By His Power all
        deliberations exist. By His Power we eat, drink and dress; by
        His Power all love exists. By His Power come the species of all
        kinds and colors; by His Power the living beings of the world
        exist. By His Power virtues exist, and by His Power vices exist.
        By His Power come honor and dishonor. By His Power wind, water
        and fire exist; by His Power earth and dust exist. Everything
        is in Your Power, Lord; You are the all-powerful Creator. Your
        Name is the Holiest of the Holy. O Nanak, through the Command
        of His Will, He beholds and pervades the creation; He is absolutely
        unrivalled.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Enjoying his pleasures, one is
        reduced to a pile of ashes, and the soul passes away. He may be
        great, but when he dies, the chain is thrown around his neck,
        and he is led away. There, his good and bad deeds are added up;
        sitting there, his account is read. He is whipped, but finds no
        place of rest, and no one hears his cries of pain. The blind man
        has wasted his life away.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  In
        the Fear of God, the wind and breezes ever blow. In the Fear of
        God, thousands of rivers flow. In the Fear of God, fire is forced
        to labor. In the Fear of God, the earth is crushed under its burden.
        In the Fear of God, the clouds move across the sky. In the Fear
        of God, the Righteous Judge of Dharma stands at His Door. In the
        Fear of God, the sun shines, and in the Fear of God, the moon
        reflects. They travel millions of miles, endlessly. In the Fear
        of God, the Siddhas exist, as do the Buddhas, the demi-gods and
        Yogis. In the Fear of God, the Akaashic ethers are stretched across
        the sky. In the Fear of God, the warriors and the most powerful
        heroes exist. In the Fear of God, multitudes come and go. God
        has inscribed the Inscription of His Fear upon the heads of all.
        O Nanak, the Fearless Lord, the Formless Lord, the True Lord,
        is One.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, the Lord is fearless
        and formless; myriads of others, like Rama, are mere dust before
        Him. There are so many stories of Krishna, so many who reflect
        over the Vedas. So many beggars dance, spinning around to the
        beat. The magicians perform their magic in the market place, creating
        a false illusion.They sing as kings and queens, and speak of this
        and that. They wear earrings, and necklaces worth thousands of
        dollars. Those bodies on which they are worn, O Nanak, those bodies
        turn to ashes. </p>

      <p> Wisdom cannot be found through mere words. To explain it is as
        hard as iron. When the Lord bestows His Grace, then alone it is
        received; other tricks and orders are useless.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        If the Merciful Lord shows His Mercy, then the True Guru is found.
        This soul wandered through countless incarnations, until the True
        Guru instructed it in the Word of the Shabad. There is no giver
        as great as the True Guru; hear this, all you people. Meeting
        the True Guru, the True Lord is found; He removes self-conceit
        from within, and instructs us in the Truth of Truths.  || 4 ||
        SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  All the hours are the milk-maids, and
        the quarters of the day are the Krishnas. The wind, water and
        fire are the ornaments; the sun and moon are the incarnations.
        All of the earth, property, wealth and articles are all entanglements.
        O Nanak, without divine knowledge, one is plundered, and devoured
        by the Messenger of Death.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The disciples
        play the music, and the gurus dance. They move their feet and
        roll their heads. The dust flies and falls upon their hair. Beholding
        them, the people laugh, and then go home. They beat the drums
        for the sake of bread. They throw themselves upon the ground.
        They sing of the milk-maids, they sing of the Krishnas. They sing
        of Sitas, and Ramas and kings. The Lord is fearless and formless;
        His Name is True. The entire universe is His Creation. Those servants,
        whose destiny is awakened, serve the Lord. The night of their
        lives is cool with dew; their minds are filled with love for the
        Lord. Contemplating the Guru, I have been taught these teachings;
        granting His Grace, He carries His servants across. The oil-press,
        the spinning wheel, the grinding stones, the potter's wheel,
        the numerous, countless whirlwinds in the desert, the spinning
        tops, the churning sticks, the threshers, the breathless tumblings
        of the birds, and the men moving round and round on spindles  - 
        O Nanak, the tumblers are countless and endless. The Lord binds
        us in bondage  -  so do we spin around. According to their
        actions, so do all people dance. Those who dance and dance and
        laugh, shall weep on their ultimate departure. They do not fly
        to the heavens, nor do they become Siddhas. They dance and jump
        around on the urgings of their minds. O Nanak, those whose minds
        are filled with the Fear of God, have the love of God in their
        minds as well.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Your Name is the Fearless Lord;
        chanting Your Name, one does not have to go to hell. Soul and
        body all belong to Him; asking Him to give us sustenance is a
        waste. If you yearn for goodness, then perform good deeds and
        feel humble. Even if you remove the signs of old age, old age
        shall still come in the guise of death. No one remains here when
        the count of the breaths is full.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        The Muslims praise the Islamic law; they read and reflect upon
        it. The Lord's bound servants are those who bind themselves
        to see the Lord's Vision. The Hindus praise the Praiseworthy
        Lord; the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, His form is incomparable.
        They bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, making offerings of
        flowers, and burning incense before idols. </p>

      <p> The Yogis meditate on the absolute Lord there; they call the Creator
        the Unseen Lord. But to the subtle image of the Immaculate Name,
        they apply the form of a body. In the minds of the virtuous, contentment
        is produced, thinking about their giving. They give and give,
        but ask a thousand-fold more, and hope that the world will honor
        them. The thieves, adulterers, perjurers, evil-doers and sinners
        -  after using up what good karma they had, they depart; have
        they done any good deeds here at all? There are beings and creatures
        in the water and on the land, in the worlds and universes, form
        upon form. Whatever they say, You know; You care for them all.
        O Nanak, the hunger of the devotees is to praise You; the True
        Name is their only support. They live in eternal bliss, day and
        night; they are the dust of the feet of the virtuous.  || 1 ||
        FIRST MEHL:  The clay of the Muslim's grave becomes clay
        for the potter's wheel. Pots and bricks are fashioned from
        it, and it cries out as it burns. The poor clay burns, burns and
        weeps, as the fiery coals fall upon it. O Nanak, the Creator created
        the creation; the Creator Lord alone knows.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Without the True Guru, no one has obtained the Lord; without
        the True Guru, no one has obtained the Lord. He has placed Himself
        within the True Guru; revealing Himself, He declares this openly.
        Meeting the True Guru, eternal liberation is obtained; He has
        banished attachment from within. This is the highest thought,
        that one's consciousness is attached to the True Lord. Thus
        the Lord of the World, the Great Giver is obtained.  || 6 || 
        SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  In ego they come, and in ego they go. In
        ego they are born, and in ego they die. In ego they give, and
        in ego they take. In ego they earn, and in ego they lose. In ego
        they become truthful or false. In ego they go to heaven or hell.
        In ego they laugh, and in ego they weep. In ego they become dirty,
        and in ego they are washed clean. In ego they lose social status
        and class. In ego they are ignorant, and in ego they are wise.
        They do not know the value of salvation and liberation. In ego
        they love Maya, and in ego they are kept in darkness by it. Living
        in ego, mortal beings are created. When one understands ego, then
        the Lord's gate is known. Without spiritual wisdom, they
        babble and argue. O Nanak, by the Lord's Command, destiny
        is recorded. As the Lord sees us, so are we seen.  || 1 ||   SECOND
        MEHL:  This is the nature of ego, that people perform their actions
        in ego. This is the bondage of ego, that time and time again,
        they are reborn. Where does ego come from? How can it be removed?
        This ego exists by the Lord's Order; people wander according
        to their past actions. Ego is a chronic disease, but it contains
        its own cure as well. If the Lord grants His Grace, one acts according
        to the Teachings of the Guru's Shabad. Nanak says, listen,
        people: in this way, troubles depart.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those
        who serve are content. </p>

      <p> They meditate on the Truest of the True. They do not place their
        feet in sin, but do good deeds and live righteously in Dharma.
        They burn away the bonds of the world, and eat a simple diet of
        grain and water. You are the Great Forgiver; You give continually,
        more and more each day. By His greatness, the Great Lord is obtained.
        || 7 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Men, trees, sacred shrines of
        pilgrimage, banks of sacred rivers, clouds, fields, islands, continents,
        worlds, solar systems, and universes; the four sources of creation
        -  born of eggs, born of the womb, born of the earth and born
        of sweat; oceans, mountains, and all beings  -  O Nanak, He
        alone knows their condition. O Nanak, having created the living
        beings, He cherishes them all. The Creator who created the creation,
        takes care of it as well. He, the Creator who formed the world,
        cares for it. Unto Him I bow and offer my reverence; His Royal
        Court is eternal. O Nanak, without the True Name, of what use
        is the frontal mark of the Hindus, or their sacred thread?  ||
        1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Hundreds of thousands of virtues and good
        actions, and hundreds of thousands of blessed charities, hundreds
        of thousands of penances at sacred shrines, and the practice of
        Sehj Yoga in the wilderness, hundreds of thousands of courageous
        actions and giving up the breath of life on the field of battle,
        hundreds of thousands of divine understandings, hundreds of thousands
        of divine wisdoms and meditations and readings of the Vedas and
        the Puraanas  -  before the Creator who created the creation,
        and who ordained coming and going, O Nanak, all these things are
        false. True is the Insignia of His Grace.  || 2 ||   PAUREE: 
        You alone are the True Lord. The Truth of Truths is pervading
        everywhere. He alone receives the Truth, unto whom You give it;
        then, he practices Truth. Meeting the True Guru, Truth is found.
        In His Heart, Truth is abiding. The fools do not know the Truth.
        The self-willed manmukhs waste their lives away in vain. Why have
        they even come into the world?  || 8 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        You may read and read loads of books; you may read and study
        vast multitudes of books. You may read and read boat-loads of
        books; you may read and read and fill pits with them. You may
        read them year after year; you may read them as many months are
        there are. You may read them all your life; you may read them
        with every breath. O Nanak, only one thing is of any account:
        everything else is useless babbling and idle talk in ego.  ||
        1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The more one write and reads, the more one
        burns. The more one wanders at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, the
        more one talks uselessly. The more one wears religious robes,
        the more pain he causes his body. O my soul, you must endure the
        consequences of your own actions. One who does not eat the corn,
        misses out on the taste. One obtains great pain, in the love of
        duality. One who does not wear any clothes, suffers night and
        day. Through silence, he is ruined. How can the sleeping one be
        awakened without the Guru? One who goes barefoot suffers by his
        own actions. One who eats filth and throws ashes on his head  - 
        the blind fool loses his honor. Without the Name, nothing is of
        any use. One who lives in the wilderness, in cemetaries and cremation
        grounds  -  that blind man does not know the Lord; he regrets
        and repents in the end. <br>
