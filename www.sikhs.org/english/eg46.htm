      <p> O Nanak, my support is the Creator Lord; I have renounced all
        other hopes.  || 2 || 10 || 19 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  Show
        Mercy to me, and grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
        I sing Your Praises night and day. With my hair, I wash the feet
        of Your slave; this is my life's purpose.  || 1 ||   O Lord
        and Master, without You, there is no other at all. O Lord, in
        my mind I remain conscious of You; with my tongue I worship You,
        and with my eyes, I gaze upon You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Merciful
        Lord, O Lord and Master of all, with my palms pressed together
        I pray to You. Nanak, Your slave, chants Your Name, and is redeemed
        in the twinkling of an eye.  || 2 || 11 || 20 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Overwhelming the realm of Brahma, the realm of Shiva and
        the realm of Indra, Maya has come running here. But she cannot
        touch the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; she washes and
        massages their feet.  || 1 ||   Now, I have come and entered the
        Lord's Sanctuary. This awful fire has burned so many; the
        True Guru has cautioned me about it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   It
        clings to the necks of the Siddhas, and the seekers, the demi-gods,
        angels and mortals. Servant Nanak has the support of God the Creator,
        who has millions of slaves like her.  || 2 || 12 || 21 ||   GUJRI,
        FIFTH MEHL: His bad reputation is erased, he is acclaimed all
        over the world, and he obtains a seat in the Court of the Lord.
        The fear of death is removed in an instant, and he goes to the
        Lord's House in peace and bliss.  || 1 ||   His works do
        not go in vain. Twenty-four hours a day, remember your God in
        meditation; meditate on Him continually in your mind and body.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I seek Your Sanctuary, O Destroyer of the
        pains of the poor; whatever You give me, God, that is what I receive.
        Nanak is imbued with the love of Your lotus feet; O Lord, please
        preserve the honor of Your slave.  || 2 || 13 || 22 ||   GUJRI,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The all-sustaining Lord is the Giver of all beings;
        His devotional worship is an overflowing treasure. Service to
        Him is not wasted; in an instant, He emancipates.  || 1 ||   O
        my mind, immerse yourself in the Lord's lotus feet. Seek
        from Him, who is worshipped by all beings.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, O Creator Lord; You, O God,
        are the support of my breath of life. He who is protected by You,
        O Helper Lord  -  what can the world do to him?  || 2 || 14
        || 23 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord Himself has protected
        the honor of His humble servant. The Guru has given the medicine
        of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, and all afflictions are gone.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Transcendent Lord, in His Mercy, has
        preserved Har Gobind. The disease is over, and there is joy all
        around; we ever contemplate the Glories of God.  || 1 ||   My
        Creator Lord has made me His own; such is the glorious greatness
        of the Perfect Guru. Guru Nanak laid the immovable foundation,
        which grows higher and higher each day.  || 2 || 15 || 24 || 
        GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  You never focused your consciousness on
        the Lord. </p>

      <p> You have spent your life engaged in worldly pursuits; you have
        not sung the Glorious Praises of the treasure of the Naam.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Shell by shell, you accumulate money; in various
        ways, you work for this. Forgetting God, you suffer awful pain
        beyond measure, and you are consumed by the Great Enticer, Maya.
        || 1 ||   Show Mercy to me, O my Lord and Master, and do not
        hold me to account for my actions. O merciful and compassionate
        Lord God, ocean of peace, Nanak has taken to Your Sanctuary, Lord.
        || 2 || 16 || 25 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  With your tongue,
        chant the Lord's Name, Raam, Raam. Renounce other false occupations,
        and vibrate forever on the Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        One Name is the support of His devotees; in this world, and in
        the world hereafter, it is their anchor and support. In His mercy
        and kindness, the Guru has given me the divine wisdom of God,
        and a discriminating intellect.  || 1 ||   The all-powerful Lord
        is the Creator, the Cause of causes; He is the Master of wealth
        -  I seek His Sanctuary. Liberation and worldly success come
        from the dust of the feet of the Holy Saints; Nanak has obtained
        the Lord's treasure.  || 2 || 17 || 26 || </p>

        GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL,  FOURTH HOUSE,  CHAU-PADAS:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Give up all your clever tricks, and seek the Sanctuary of the
        Holy Saint. Sing the Glorious Praises of the Supreme Lord God,
        the Transcendent Lord.  || 1 ||   O my consciousness, contemplate
        and adore the Lotus Feet of the Lord. You shall obtain total peace
        and salvation, and all troubles shall depart.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Mother, father, children, friends and siblings  -  without
        the Lord, none of them are real. Here and hereafter, He is the
        companion of the soul; He is pervading everywhere.  || 2 ||  
        Millions of plans, tricks, and efforts are of no use, and serve
        no purpose. In the Sanctuary of the Holy, one becomes immaculate
        and pure, and obtains salvation, through the Name of God.  ||
        3 ||   God is profound and merciful, lofty and exalted; He gives
        Sanctuary to the Holy. He alone obtains the Lord, O Nanak, who
        is blessed with such pre-ordained destiny to meet Him.  || 4 ||
        1 || 27 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  Serve your Guru forever, and
        chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. With each
        and every breath, worship the Lord, Har, Har, in adoration, and
        the anxiety of your mind will be dispelled.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        chant the Name of God. You shall be blessed with peace, poise
        and pleasure, and you shall find the immaculate place.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, redeem
        your mind, and and adore the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Sexual
        desire, anger and egotism will be dispelled, and all troubles
        shall end.  || 2 ||   The Lord Master is immovable, immortal and
        inscrutable; seek His Sanctuary. Worship in adoration the lotus
        feet of the Lord in your heart, and center your consciousness
        lovingly on Him alone.  || 3 ||   The Supreme Lord God has shown
        mercy to me, and He Himself has forgiven me. The Lord has given
        me His Name, the treasure of peace; O Nanak, meditate on that
        God.  || 4 || 2 || 28 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  By Guru's
        Grace, I meditate on God, and my doubts are gone. </p>

      <p> Pain, ignorance and fear have left me, and my sins have been dispelled.
        || 1 ||   My mind is filled with love for the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har. Meeting the Holy Saint, under His Instruction, I meditate
        on the Lord of the Universe, in the most immaculate way.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Chanting, deep meditation and various rituals
        are contained in the fruitful meditative remembrance of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Showing His Mercy, the Lord Himself has
        protected me, and all my works have been brought to fruition.
        || 2 ||   With each and every breath, may I never forget You,
        O God, Almighty Lord and Master. How can my tongue describe Your
        countless virtues? They are uncountable, and forever indescribable.
        || 3 ||   You are the Remover of the pains of the poor, the Savior,
        the Compassionate Lord, the Bestower of Mercy. Remembering the
        Naam in meditation, the state of eternal dignity is obtained;
        Nanak has grasped the protection of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4
        || 3 || 29 ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  Intellectual egotism and
        great love for Maya are the most serious chronic diseases. The
        Lord's Name is the medicine, which is potent to cure everything.
        The Guru has given me the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        My mind and body yearn for the dust of the Lord's humble
        servants. With it, the sins of millions of incarnations are obliterated.
        O Lord of the Universe, please fulfill my desire.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, one is
        hounded by dreadful desires. Through the Guru's spiritual
        wisdom, we sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord of the Universe,
        and the noose of death is cut away.  || 2 ||   Those who are cheated
        by sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment suffer
        reincarnation forever. By loving devotional worship to God, and
        meditative remembrance of the Lord of the World, one's wandering
        in reincarnation is ended.  || 3 ||   Friends, children, spouses
        and well-wishers are burnt by the three fevers. Chanting the Name
        of the Lord, Raam, Raam, one's miseries are ended, as one
        meets the Saintly servants of the Lord.  || 4 ||   Wandering around
        in all directions, they cry out, &quot;Nothing can save us!&quot;
        Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lotus Feet of the Infinite
        Lord; he holds fast to their Support.  || 5 || 4 || 30 || </p>

        again. || 1 ||   O my mind, worship the Lord's Lotus Feet.
        Meditating in remembrance, strife and sorrow are ended, and the
        noose of the Messenger of Death is snapped.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Chant the Name of the Lord, and your enemies shall be consumed;
        there is no other way. Show Mercy, O my God, and bestow upon Nanak
        the taste of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2 || 1 || 31
        ||   GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are the Almighty Lord, the Giver
        of Sanctuary, the Destroyer of pain, the King of happiness. Troubles
        depart, and fear and doubt are dispelled, singing the Glorious
        Praises of the Immaculate Lord God.  || 1 ||   O Lord of the Universe,
        without You, there is no other place. Show Mercy to me, O Supreme
        Lord Master, that I may chant Your Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

        Feet; by great good fortune, I have embraced love for Him. My

        the Holy; I have renounced evil-mindedness and intellectualism.
        || 2 ||   One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, twenty-four

        to the poor, saves himself, and redeems all his generations; all
        of his bonds are released.  || 3 ||   I take the Support of Your
        Feet, O God, O Lord and Master; you are with me through and through,
        God. Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, God; giving him His hand,

      </center>
      <p> In the one village of the body, live the five thieves; they have
        been warned, but they still go out stealing. One who keeps his
        assets safe from the three modes and the ten passions, O Nanak,
        attains liberation and emancipation.  || 1 ||   Center your mind
        on the all-pervading Lord, the Wearer of garlands of the jungles.
        Let your rosary be the chanting of the Lord's Name in your
        heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Its roots extend upwards, and its
        branches reach down; the four Vedas are attached to it. He alone
        reaches this tree with ease, O Nanak, who remains wakeful in the
        Love of the Supreme Lord God.  || 2 ||   The Elysian Tree is the
        courtyard of my house; in it are the flowers, leaves and stems
        of reality. Meditate on the self-existent, immaculate Lord, whose
        Light is pervading everywhere; renounce all your worldly entanglements.
        || 3 ||   Listen, O seekers of Truth  -  Nanak begs you to
        renounce the traps of Maya. Reflect within your mind, that by
        enshrining love for the One Lord, you shall not be subject to
        birth and death again.  || 4 ||   He alone is said to be a Guru,
        he alone is said to be a Sikh, and he alone is said to be a physician,
        who knows the patient's illness. He is not affected by actions,
        responsibilities and entanglements; in the entanglements of his
        household, he maintains the detachment of Yoga.  || 5 ||   He
        renounces sexual desire, anger, egotism, greed, attachment and
        Maya. Within his mind, he meditates on the reality of the Imperishable
        Lord; by Guru's Grace he finds Him.  || 6 ||   Spiritual
        wisdom and meditation are all said to be God's gifts; all
        of the demons are turned white before him. He enjoys the taste
        of the honey of God's lotus; he remains awake, and does not
        fall asleep.  || 7 ||   This lotus is very deep; its leaves are
        the nether regions, and it is connected to the whole universe.
        Under Guru's Instruction, I shall not have to enter the womb
        again; I have renounced the poison of corruption, and I drink
        in the Ambrosial Nectar.  || 8 || 1 ||   GUJRI,  FIRST MEHL: 
        Those who beg of God the Great Giver  -  their numbers cannot
        be counted. You, Almighty True Lord, fulfill the desires within
        their hearts.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, chanting, deep meditation,
        self-discipline and truth are my foundations. Bless me with Your
        Name, Lord, that I may find peace. Your devotional worship is
        a treasure over-flowing.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Some remain absorbed
        in Samaadhi, their minds fixed lovingly on the One Lord; they
        reflect only on the Word of the Shabad. In that state, there is
        no water, land, earth or sky; only the Creator Lord Himself exists.
        || 2 ||   There is no intoxication of Maya there, and no shadow,
        nor the infinite light of the sun or the moon. </p>

      <p> The eyes within the mind which see everything  -  with one
        glance, they see the three worlds.  || 3 ||   He created air,
        water and fire, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva  -  the whole creation.
        All are beggars; You alone are the Great Giver, God. You give
        Your gifts according to Your own considerations.  || 4 ||   Thirty-three
        million gods beg of God the Master; even as He gives, His treasures
        are never exhausted. Nothing can be contained in a vessel turned
        upside-down; Ambrosial Nectar pours into the upright one.  ||
        5 ||   The Siddhas in Samaadhi beg for wealth and miracles, and
        proclaim His victory. As is the thirst within their minds, so
        is the water which You give to them.  || 6 ||   The most fortunate
        ones serve their Guru; there is no difference between the Divine
        Guru and the Lord. The Messenger of Death cannot see those who
        come to realize within their minds the contemplative meditation
        of the Word of the Shabad.  || 7 ||   I shall never ask anything
        else of the Lord; please, bless me with the Love of Your Immaculate
        Name. Nanak, the song-bird, begs for the Ambrosial Water; O Lord,
        shower Your Mercy upon him, and bless him with Your Praise.  ||
        8 || 2 ||   GUJRI,  FIRST MEHL:  O Dear One, he is born, and then
        dies; he continues coming and going; without the Guru, he is not
        emancipated. Those mortals who become Gurmukhs are attuned to
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the Name, they obtain
        salvation and honor.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, focus your
        consciousness lovingly on the Lord's Name. By Guru's
        Grace, one begs of the Lord God; such is the glorious greatness
        of the Naam.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Dear One, so many wear various
        religious robes, for begging and filling their bellies. Without
        devotional worship to the Lord, O mortal, there can be no peace.
        Without the Guru, pride does not depart.  || 2 ||   O Dear One,
        death hangs constantly over his head. Incarnation after incarnation,
        it is his enemy. Those who are attuned to the True Word of the
        Shabad are saved. The True Guru has imparted this understanding.
        || 3 ||   In the Guru's Sanctuary, the Messenger of Death
        cannot see the mortal, or torture him. I am imbued with the Imperishable
        and Immaculate Lord Master, and lovingly attached to the Fearless
        Lord.  || 4 ||   O Dear One, implant the Naam within me; lovingly
        attached to the Naam, I lean on the True Guru's Support.
        Whatever pleases Him, He does; no one can erase His actions. 
        || 5 ||   O Dear One, I have hurried to the Sanctuary of the Guru;
        I have no love for any other except You. I constantly call upon
        the One Lord; since the very beginning, and throughout the ages,
        He has been my help and support.  || 6 ||   O Dear One, please
        preserve the Honor of Your Name; I am hand and glove with You.
        Bless me with Your Mercy, and reveal to me the Blessed Vision
        of Your Darshan, O Guru. Through the Word of the Shabad, I have
        burnt away my ego.  || 7 ||   O Dear One, what should I ask of
        You? Nothing appears permanent; whoever comes into this world
        shall depart. Bless Nanak with the wealth of the Naam, to adorn
        his heart and neck.  || 8 || 3 ||   GUJRI,  FIRST MEHL:  O Dear
        One, I am not high or low or in the middle. I am the Lord's
        slave, and I seek the Lord's Sanctuary. Imbued with the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, I am detached from the world; I have forgotten
        sorrow, separation and disease.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny,

        the Pure Lord. He is not under the power of the Messenger of Death,
        nor does he owe Death anything.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He chants
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord with his tongue, and abides with
        God; he does whatever pleases the Lord. Without the Lord's
        Name, life passes in vain in the world, and every moment is useless.
        || 2 ||   The false have no place of rest, either inside or outside;
        the slanderer does not find salvation. Even if one is resentful,
        God does not withhold His blessings; day by day, they increase.
        || 3 ||   No one can take away the Guru's gifts; my Lordand
        Master Himself has given them. The black-faced slanderers, with
        slander in their mouths, do not appreciate the Guru's gifts.
        || 4 ||   God forgives and blends with Himself those who take
        to His Sanctuary; He does not delay for an instant. He is the
        source of bliss, the Greatest Lord; through the True Guru, we
        are united in His Union.  || 5 ||   Through His Kindness, the
        Kind Lord pervades us; through Guru's Teachings, our wanderings
        cease. Touching the philosopher's stone, metal is transformed
        into gold. Such is the glorious greatness of the Society of the
        Saints.  || 6 ||   The Lord is the immaculate water; the mind
        is the bather, and the True Guru is the bath attendant, O Siblings
        of Destiny. That humble being who joins the Sat Sangat shall not
        be consigned to reincarnation again; his light merges into the
        Light.  || 7 ||   You are the Great Primal Lord, the infinite
        tree of life; I am a bird perched on Your branches. Grant to Nanak
        the Immaculate Naam; throughout the ages, he sings the Praises
        of the Shabad.  || 8 || 4 || </p>

      <p> The devotees worship the Lord in loving adoration. They thirst
        for the True Lord, with infinite affection. They tearfully beg
        and implore the Lord; in love and affection, their consciousness
        is at peace.  || 1 ||   Chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        O my mind, and take to His Sanctuary. The Lord's Name is
        the boat to cross over the world-ocean. Practice such a way of
        life.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O mind, even death wishes you well,
        when you remember the Lord through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. The intellect receives the treasure, the knowledge of
        reality and supreme bliss, by repeating the Lord's Name in
        the mind.  || 2 ||   The fickle consciousness wanders around chasing
        after wealth; it is intoxicated with worldly love and emotional
        attachment. Devotion to the Naam is permanently implanted within
        the mind, when it is attuned to the Guru's Teachings and
        His Shabad.  || 3 ||   Wandering around, doubt is not dispelled;
        afflicted by reincarnation, the world is being ruined. The Lord's
        eternal throne is free of this affliction; he is truly wise, who
        takes the Naam as his deep meditation.  || 4 ||   This world is
        engrossed in attachment and transitory love; it suffers the terrible
        pains of birth and death. Run to the Sanctuary of the True Guru,
        chant the Lord's Name in your heart, and you shall swim across.
        || 5 ||   Following the Guru's Teaching, the mind becomes
        stable; the mind accepts it, and reflects upon it in peaceful
        poise. That mind is pure, which enshrines Truth within, and the
        most excellent jewel of spiritual wisdom.  || 6 ||   By the Fear
        of God, and Love of God, and by devotion, man crosses over the
        terrifying world-ocean, focusing his consciousness on the Lord's
        Lotus Feet. </p>

      <p> I dance, and make this mind dance as well. By Guru's Grace,
        I eliminate my self-conceit. One who keeps his consciousness focused
        on the Lord is liberated; he obtains the fruits of his desires.
        || 1 ||   So dance, O mind, before your Guru. If you dance according
        to the Guru's Will, you shall obtain peace, and in the end,
        the fear of death shall leave you.  ||  Pause  ||   One whom the
        Lord Himself causes to dance, is called a devotee. He Himself
        links us to His Love. He Himself sings, He Himself listens, and
        He puts this blind mind on the right path.  || 2 ||   One who
        dances night and day, and banishes Shakti's Maya, enters
        the House of the Lord Shiva, where there is no sleep. The world
        is asleep in Maya, the house of Shakti; it dances, jumps and sings
        in duality. The self-willed manmukh has no devotion.  || 3 ||
        The angels, mortals, renunciates, ritualists, silent sages and
        beings of spiritual wisdom dance. The Siddhas and seekers, lovingly
        focused on the Lord, dance, as do the Gurmukhs, whose minds dwell
        in reflective meditation.  || 4 ||   The planets and solar systems
        dance in the three qualities, as do those who bear love for You,
        Lord. The beings and creatures all dance, and the four sources
        of creation dance.  || 5 ||   They alone dance, who are pleasing
        to You, and who, as Gurmukhs, embrace love for the Word of the
        Shabad. They are devotees, with the essence of spiritual wisdom,
        who obey the Hukam of His Command.  || 6 ||   This is devotional
        worship, that one loves the True Lord; without service, one cannot
        be a devotee. If one remains dead while yet alive, he reflects
        upon the Shabad, and then, he obtains the True Lord.  || 7 ||
        So many people dance for the sake of Maya; how rare are those
        who contemplate reality. By Guru's Grace, that humble being
        obtains You, Lord, upon whom You show Mercy.  || 8 ||   If I forget
        the True Lord, even for an instant, that time passes in vain.
        With each and every breath, constantly remember the Lord; He Himself
        shall forgive you, according to His Will.  || 9 ||   They alone
        dance, who are pleasing to Your Will, and who, as Gurmukhs, contemplate
        the Word of the Shabad. Says Nanak, they alone find celestial
        peace, whom You bless with Your Grace.  || 10 || 1 || 6 || </p>

        my mind, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is a boat to carry

        chant Your Name, O Lord of the jungle. Slave Prahlaad sought Your
        Sanctuary, and You saved his honor.  || 2 ||   The One unseen
        immaculate Lord is pervading everywhere, as is the Light of the
        Lord. All are beggars, You alone are the Great Giver. Reaching
        out our hands, we beg from You.  || 3 ||   The speech of the humble
        devotees is sublime; they sing continually the wondrous, Unspoken
        Speech of the Lord. Their lives become fruitful; they save themselves,
        and all their generations.  || 4 ||   The self-willed manmukhs
        are engrossed in duality and evil-mindedness; within them is the
        darkness of attachment. They do not love the sermon of the humble
        Saints, and they are drowned along with their families.  || 5
        ||   By slandering, the slanderer washes the filth off others;
        he is an eater of filth, and a worshipper of Maya. He indulges
        in the slander of the humble Saints; he is neither on this shore,
        nor the shore beyond.  || 6 ||   All this worldly drama is set
        in motion by the Creator Lord; He has infused His almighty strength
        into all. The thread of the One Lord runs through the world; when
        He pulls out this thread, the One Creator alone remains.  || 7
        ||   With their tongues, they sing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord, and savor Them. They place the sublime essence of the Lord
        upon their tongues, and savor it. O Nanak, other than the Lord,
        I ask for nothing else; I am in love with the Love of the Lord's
        sublime essence.  || 8 || 1 || 7 || </p>

      <p> SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  This world perishing in attachment and possessiveness;
        no one knows the way of life. One who walks in harmony with the
        Guru's Will, obtains the supreme status of life. Those humble
        beings who focus their consciousness on the Lord's Feet,

        in the minds of the Gurmukhs, who merge in celestial bliss.  ||
        1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Within the self is the pain of doubt; engrossed
        in worldly affairs, they are killing themselves. Asleep in the
        love of duality, they never wake up; they are in love with, and
        attached to Maya. They do not think of the Naam, the Name of the

      <p> This is the conduct of the self-willed manmukhs. They do not obtain
        the Lord's Name, and they waste away their lives in vain;
        O Nanak, the Messenger of Death punishes and dishonors them. 
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He created Himself  -  at that time, there
        was no other. He consulted Himself for advice, and what He did
        came to pass. At that time, there were no Akaashic Ethers, no
        nether regions, nor the three worlds. At that time, only the Formless
        Lord Himself existed  -  there was no creation. As it pleased
        Him, so did He act; without Him, there was no other.  || 1 ||
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  My Master is eternal. He is seen by practicing
        the Word of the Shabad. He never perishes; He does not come or
        go in reincarnation. So serve Him, forever and ever; He is contained
        in all. Why serve another who is born, and then dies? Fruitless
        is the life of those who do not know their Lord and Master, and
        who center their consciousness on others. O Nanak, it cannot be
        known, how much punishment the Creator shall inflict on them.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Meditate on the True Name; the True Lord
        is pervading everywhere. O Nanak, by understanding the Hukam of
        the Lord's Command, one becomes acceptable, and then obtains
        the fruit of Truth. He wanders around babbling and speaking, but
        he does not understand the Lord's Command at all. He is blind,
        the falsest of the false.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Creating union and
        separation, He laid the foundations of the Universe. By His Command,
        the Lord of Light fashioned the Universe, and infused His Divine
        Light into it. From the Lord of Light, all light originates. The
        True Guru proclaims the Word of the Shabad. Brahma, Vishnu and
        Shiva, under the influence of the three dispositions, were put
        to their tasks. He created the root of Maya, and the peace obtained
        in the fourth state of consciousness.  || 2 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  That alone is chanting, and that alone is deep meditation,
        which is pleasing to the True Guru. Pleasing the True Guru, glorious
        greatness is obtained. O Nanak, renouncing self-conceit, one merges
        into the Guru.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  How rare are those who
        receive the Guru's Teachings. O Nanak, he alone receives
        it, whom the Lord Himself blesses with glorious greatness.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  Emotional attachment to Maya is spiritual darkness;
        it is very difficult and such a heavy load. Loaded with so very
        many stones of sin, how can the boat cross over? Those who are
        attuned to the Lord's devotional worship night and day are
        carried across. Under the Instruction of the Guru's Shabad,
        one sheds egotism and corruption, and the mind becomes immaculate.
        Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; the Lord, Har, Har,
        is our Saving Grace.  || 3 ||   SHALOK:  O Kabeer, the gate of
        liberation is narrow, less than one-tenth of a mustard seed. The
        mind has become as big as an elephant; how can it pass through
        this gate? If one meets such a True Guru, by His Pleasure, He
        shows His Mercy. Then, the gate of liberation becomes wide open,
        and the soul easily passes through.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O
        Nanak, the gate of liberation is very narrow; only the very tiny
        can pass through. Through egotism, the mind has become bloated.
        How can it pass through? </p>

      <p> Meeting the True Guru, egotism departs, and one is filled with
        the Divine Light. Then, this soul is liberated forever, and it
        remains absorbed in celestial bliss.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  God created
        the Universe, and He keeps it under His power. God cannot be obtained
        by counting; the mortal wanders in doubt. Meeting the True Guru,
        one remains dead while yet alive; understanding Him, he is absorbed
        in the Truth. Through the Word of the Shabad, egotism is eradicated,
        and one is united in the Lord's Union. He knows everything,
        and Himself does everything; beholding His Creation, He rejoices.
        || 4 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  One who has not focused his consciousness
        on the True Guru, and into whose mind the Naam does not come  - 
        cursed is such a life. What has he gained by coming into the world?
        Maya is false capital; in an instant, its false covering falls
        off. When it slips from his hand, his body turns black, and his
        face withers away. Those who focus their consciousness on the
        True Guru  -  peace comes to abide in their minds. They meditate
        on the Name of the Lord with love; they are lovingly attuned to
        the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, the True Guru has bestowed upon
        them the wealth, which remains contained within their hearts.
        They are imbued with supreme love; its color increases day by
        day.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Maya is a serpent, clinging to the
        world. Whoever serves her, she ultimately devours. The Gurmukh
        is a snake-charmer; he has trampled her and thrown her down, and
        crushed her underfoot. O Nanak, they alone are saved, who remain
        lovingly absorbed in the True Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The minstrel
        cries out, and God hears him. He is comforted within his mind,
        and he obtains the Perfect Lord. Whatever destiny is pre-ordained
        by the Lord, those are the deeds he does. When the Lord and Master
        becomes Merciful, then one obtains the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence as his home. That God of mine is so very great; as Gurmukh,
        I have met Him.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  There is One
        Lord God of all; He remains ever-present. O Nanak, if one does
        not obey the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then within one's
        own home, the Lord seems far away. They alone obey the Lord's
        Command, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace. Obeying His Command,
        one obtains peace, and becomes the happy, loving soul-bride. 
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  She who does not love her Husband Lord,
        burns and wastes away all through the night of her life. O Nanak,
        the soul-brides dwell in peace; they have the Lord, their King,
        as their Husband.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Roaming over the entire
        world, I have seen that the Lord is the only Giver. The Lord cannot
        be obtained by any device at all; He is the Architect of Karma.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord comes to
        dwell in the mind, and the Lord is easily revealed within. The
        fire of desire within is quenched, and one bathes in the Lord's
        Pool of Ambrosial Nectar. The great greatness of the great Lord
        God  -  the Gurmukh speaks of this.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  What love is this between the body and soul, which ends
        when the body falls? <br>
