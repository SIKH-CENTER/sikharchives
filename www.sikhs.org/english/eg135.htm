      <p> With intuitive peace and poise, I contemplate the Glorious Virtues
        of Guru Arjun. He was revealed in the House of Guru Raam Daas,
        and all hopes and desires were fulfilled. From birth, He realized
        God through the Guru's Teachings. With palms pressed together,
        Kall the poet speaks His praises. The Lord brought Him into the
        world, to practice the Yoga of devotional worship. The Word of
        the Guru's Shabad has been revealed, and the Lord dwells
        on His tongue. Attached to Guru Nanak, Guru Angad and Guru Amar
        Daas, He attained the supreme status. In the House of Guru Raam
        Daas, the devotee of the Lord, Guru Arjun was born.  || 1 || 
        By great good fortune, the mind is uplifted and exalted, and
        the Word of the Shabad dwells in the heart. The jewel of the mind
        is contented; the Guru has implanted the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, within. The Inaccessible and Unfathomable, Supreme Lord
        God is revealed through the True Guru. In the House of Guru Raam
        Daas, Guru Arjun has appeared as the Embodiment of the Fearless
        Lord.  || 2 ||   The benign rule of Raja Janak has been established,
        and the Golden Age of Sat Yuga has begun. Through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad, the mind is pleased and appeased; the
        unsatisfied mind is satisfied. Guru Nanak laid the foundation
        of Truth; He is blended with the True Guru. In the House of Guru
        Raam Daas, Guru Arjun has appeared as the Embodiment of the Infinite
        Lord.  || 3 ||   The Sovereign Lord King has staged this wondrous
        play; contentment was gathered together, and pure understanding
        was infused in the True Guru. Kall the poet utters the Praises
        of the Unborn, Self-existent Lord. Guru Nanak blessed Guru Angad,
        and Guru Angad blessed Guru Amar Daas with the treasure. Guru
        Raam Daas blessed Guru Arjun, who touched the Philosopher's
        Stone, and was certified.  || 4 ||   O Guru Arjun, You are Eternal,
        Invaluable, Unborn, Self-existent, the Destroyer of fear, the
        Dispeller of pain, Infinite and Fearless. You have grasped the
        Ungraspable, and burnt away doubt and skepticism. You bestow cooling
        and soothing peace. The Self-existent, Perfect Primal Lord God
        Creator has taken birth. First, Guru Nanak, then Guru Angad and
        Guru Amar Daas, the True Guru, haave been absorbed into the Word
        of the Shabad. Blessed, blessed is Guru Raam Daas, the Philosopher's
        Stone, who transformed Guru Arjun unto Himself.  || 5 ||   His
        victory is proclaimed all over the world; His Home is blessed
        with good fortune; He remains united with the Lord. By great good
        fortune, He has found the Perfect Guru; He remains lovingly attuned
        to Him, and endures the load of the earth. He is the Destroyer
        of fear, the Eradicator of the pains of others. Kall the poet
        utters Your Praise, O Guru.  || 6 ||   The Support of the Dharma,
        immersed in the deep and profound Teachings of the Guru, the Remover
        of the pains of others. The Shabad is excellent and sublime, kind
        and generous like the Lord, the Destroyer of egotism. The Great
        Giver, the spiritual wisdom of the True Guru, His mind does not
        grow weary of its yearning for the Lord. The Embodiment of Truth,
        the Mantra of the Lord's Name, the nine treasures are never
        exhausted. O Son of Guru Raam Daas, You are contained amidst all;
        the canopy of intuitive wisdom is spread above You. <br>

      </p>
      <p> So speaks Kall the poet: O Guru Arjun, You know the sublime essence
        of Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success.  || 7 ||   In
        the Fear of God, You enjoy the Fearless Lord; among the thousands
        of beings, You see the Unseen Lord. Through the True Guru, You
        have realized the state of the Inaccessible, Unfathomable, Profound
        Lord. Meeting with the Guru, You are certified and approved; You
        practice Yoga in the midst of wealth and power. Blessed, blessed,
        blessed is the Guru, who has filled to overflowing the pools which
        were empty. Reaching up to the certified Guru, You endure the
        unendurable; You are immersed in the pool of contentment. So speaks
        Kall: O Guru Arjun, You have intuitively attained the state of
        Yoga within Yourself.  || 8 ||   Nectar drips from Your tongue,
        and Your mouth gives Blessings, O Incomprehensible and Infinite
        Spiritual Hero. O Guru, the Word of Your Shabad eradicates egotism.
        You have overpowered the five enticers, and established with intuitive
        ease the Absolute Lord within Your own being. Attached to the
        Lord's Name, the world is saved; enshrine the True Guru
        within your heart. So speaks Kall: O Guru Arjun, You have illliminated
        the highest pinnacle of wisdom.  || 9 ||   SORAT'H:  Guru
        Arjun is the certified Primal Person; like Arjuna, He never leaves
        the field of battle. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is His spear
        and insignia. He is embellished with the Shabad, the Word of the
        True Guru.  || 1 ||   The Lord's Name is the Boat, the
        Bridge to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. You are in love
        with the True Guru; attached to the Naam, You have saved the world.
        || 2 ||   The Naam is the Saving Grace of the world; by the Pleasure
        of the True Guru, it is obtained. Now, I am not concerned with
        anything else; at Your Door, I am fulfilled.  || 3 || 12 ||  
        The Embodiment of Light, the Lord Himself is called Guru Nanak.
        From Him, came Guru Angad; His essence was absorbed into the essence.
        Guru Angad showed His Mercy, and established Amar Daas as the
        True Guru. Guru Amar Daas blessed Guru Raam Daas with the umbrella
        of immortality. So speaks Mat'huraa: gazing upon the Blessed
        Vision, the Darshan of Guru Raam Daas, His speech became as sweet
        as nectar. With your eyes, see the certified Primal Person, Guru
        Arjun, the Fifth Manifestation of the Guru.  || 1 ||   He is the
        Embodiment of Truth; He has enshrined the True Name, Sat Naam,
        Truth and contentment within His heart. From the very beginning,
        the Primal Being has written this destiny upon His forehead. His
        Divine Light shines forth, dazzling and radiant; His Glorious
        Grandeur pervades the realms of the world. Meeting the Guru, touching
        the Philosopher's Stone, He was acclaimed as Guru. So speaks
        Mat'huraa: I constantly focus my consciousness on Him;
        as sunmukh, I look to Him. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, Guru
        Arjun is the Boat; attached to him, the entire universe is safely
        carried across.  || 2 ||   I beg from that humble being who is
        known all over the world, who lives in, and loves the Name, night
        and day. He is supremely unattached, and imbued with the Love
        of the Transcendent Lord; he is free of desire, but he lives as
        a family man. He is dedicated to the Love of the Infinite, Limitless
        Primal Lord God; he has no concerns for any other pleasure, except
        for the Lord God. Guru Arjun is the All-pervading Lord God of
        Mat'huraa. <br>
      </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Devoted to His Worship, he remains attached to the Lord's
        Feet.  || 3 ||   All the gods, silent sages, Indra, Shiva and
        Yogis have not found the Lord's limits - not even
        Brahma who contemplates the Vedas. I shall not give up meditating
        on the Lord, even for an instant. The God of Mat'huraa
        is Merciful to the meek; He blesses and uplifts the Sangats throughout
        the Universe. Guru Raam Daas, to save the world, enshrined the
        Guru's Light into Guru Arjun.  || 4 ||   In this world,
        there is no other Great Soul; the Lord revealed Himself, incarnated
        as Guru Arjun. Millions of pains are taken away, from those who
        drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, says Mat'huraa.
        O mortal being, do not leave this path; do not think that there
        is any difference between God and Guru. The Perfect Lord God has
        manifested Himself; He dwells in the heart of Guru Arjun.  ||
        5 ||   As long as the destiny written upon my forehead was not
        activated, I wandered around lost, running in all directions.
        I was drowning in the horrible world-ocean of this Dark Age of
        Kali Yuga, and my remorse would never have ended. O Mat'huraa,
        consider this essential truth: to save the world, the Lord incarnated
        Himself. Whoever meditates on Guru Arjun Dayv, shall not have
        to pass through the painful womb of reincarnation ever again.
        || 6 ||   In the ocean of this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord's
        Name has been revealed in the Form of Guru Arjun, to save the
        world. Pain and poverty are taken away from that person, within
        whose heart the Saint abides. He is the Pure, Immaculate Form
        of the Infinite Lord; except for Him, there is no other at all.
        Whoever knows Him in thought, word and deed, becomes just like
        Him. He is totally pervading the earth, the sky and the nine regions
        of the planet. He is the Embodiment of the Light of God. So speaks
        Mat'huraa: there is no difference between God and Guru;
        Guru Arjun is the Personification of the Lord Himself.  || 7 ||
        19 ||   The Water of the Guru is like the Ganges, invincible and
        unstoppable. The Sikhs of the Sangat all bathe in it. The Puraanaas
        dwell continually upon the Guru; Brahma sings His Praises in the
        Vedas. The invincible chauri, the fly-brush, waves over His head;
        with His mouth, He drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam.
        The Transcendent Lord Himself has placed the royal canopy over
        the head of Guru Arjun. Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Daas
        and Guru Raam Daas met together before the Lord. So speaks Harbans:
        Their Praises echo and resound all over the world; who can possibly
        say that the Great Gurus are dead?  || 1 ||   When it was the
        Will of the Transcendent Lord Himself, Guru Raam Daas went to
        the City of God. The Lord offered Him His Royal Throne, and seated
        the Guru upon it. The angels and gods were delighted; they proclaimed
        and celebrated Your victory, O Guru. The demons ran away; their
        sins made them shake and tremble inside. Those people who found
        Guru Raam daas were rid of their sins. He gave the Royal Canopy
        and Throne to Guru Arjun, and came home.  || 2 || 21 || 9 || 11

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> <font color="#000000">O you with swollen breasts, let your consciousness
        become deep and profound. O mother-in-law, how can I bow? Because
        of my stiff nipples, I cannot bow. O sister, those mansions built
        as high as mountains - I have seen them come crumbling
        down. O bride, do not be so proud of your nipples.  || 1 ||  
        O bride with deer-like eyes, listen to the words of deep and infinite
        wisdom. First, examine the merchandise, and then, make the deal.
        Proclaim that you will not associate with evil people; celebrate
        victory with your friends. This proclamation, to meet with your
        friends, O bride - give it some thought. Surrender mind
        and body to the Lord your Friend; this is the most excellent pleasure.
        Do not fall in love with one who is destined to leave. O Nanak,
        I am a sacrifice to those who understand this.  || 2 ||   If you
        wish to swim across the water, then consult those who know how
        to swim. Those who have survived these treacherous waves are very
        wise.  || 3 ||   The storm rages and the rain floods the land;
        thousands of waves rise and surge. If you cry out for help from
        the True Guru, you have nothing to fear - your boat will
        not sink.  || 4 ||   O Nanak, what has happened to the world?
        There is no guide or friend. There is no love, even among brothers
        and relatives. For the sake of the world, people have lost their
        faith.  || 5 ||   They cry and weep and wail. They slap their
        faces and pull their hair out. But if they chant the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, they shall be absorbed into it. O Nanak, I am
        a sacrifice to them.  || 6 ||   O my mind, do not waver or walk
        on the crooked path; take the straight and true path. The terrible
        tiger is behind you, and the pool of fire is ahead. My soul is
        skeptical and doubtful, but I cannot see any other way to go.
        O Nanak, as Gurmukh, dwell with your Beloved Lord, and you shall
        be saved.  || 7 ||   The tiger is killed, and the mind is killed,
        through the Teachings of the True Guru. <br>

      <p> One who understands himself, meets with the Lord, and never dies
        again. One who sees the One and Only Lord with his eyes -
        his hands shall not get muddy and dirty. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs
        are saved; the Guru has surrounded the ocean with the embankment
        of Truth.  || 8 ||   If you wish to put out the fire, then look
        for water; without the Guru, the ocean of water is not found.
        You shall continue to wander lost in reincarnation through birth
        and death, even if you do thousands of other deeds. But you shall
        not be taxed by the Messenger of Death, if you walk in harmony
        with the Will of the True Guru. O Nanak, the immaculate, immortal
        status is obtained, and the Guru will unite you in the Lord's
        Union.  || 9 ||   The crow rubs and washes itself in the mud puddle.
        Its mind and body are polluted with its own mistakes and demerits,
        and its beak is filled with dirt. The swan in the pool associated
        with the crow, not knowing that it was evil. Such is the love
        of the faithless cynic; understand this, O spiritually wise ones,
        through love and devotion. So proclaim the victory of the Society
        of the Saints, and act as Gurmukh. Immaculate and pure is that
        cleansing bath, O Nanak, at the sacred shrine of the Guru's
        river.  || 10 ||   What should I account as the rewards of this
        human life, if one does not feel love and devotion to the Lord?
        Wearing clothes and eating food is useless, if the mind is filled
        with the love of duality. Seeing and hearing is false, if one
        speaks lies. O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; everything
        else is coming and going in egotism.  || 11 ||   The Saints are
        few and far between; everything else in the world is just a pompous
        show.  || 12 ||   O Nanak, one who is struck by the Lord dies
        instantaneously; the power to live is lost. If someone dies by
        such a stroke, then he is accepted. He alone is struck, who is
        struck by the Lord; after such a stroke, he is approved. The arrow
        of love, shot by the All-knowing Lord, cannot be pulled out. 
        || 13 ||   Who can wash the unbaked clay pot? Joining the five
        elements together, the Lord made a false cover. When it pleases
        Him, He makes it right. The supreme light shines forth, and the
        celestial song vibrates and resounds.  || 14 ||   Those who are
        totally blind in their minds, do not have the integrity to keep
        their word. With their blind minds, and their upside-down heart-lotus,
        they look totally ugly. Some know how to speak and understand
        what they are told. Those people are wise and good-looking. Some
        do not know the Sound-current of the Naad, spiritual wisdom or
        the joy of song. They do not even understand good and bad. Some
        have no idea of perfection, wisdom or understanding; they know
        nothing about the mystery of the Word. O Nanak, those people are
        really donkeys; they have no virtue or merit, but still, they
        are very proud.  || 15 ||   He alone is a Brahmin, who knows God.
        He chants and meditates, and practices austerity and good deeds.
        He keeps to the Dharma, with faith, humility and contentment.
        Breaking his bonds, he is liberated. Such a Brahmin is worthy
        of being worshipped.  || 16 ||   He alone is a Kh'shaatriyaa,
        who is a hero in good deeds. He uses his body to give in charity;
        he understands his farm, and plants the seeds of generosity. Such
        a Kh'shaatriyaa is accepted in the Court of the Lord. Whoever
        practices greed, possessiveness and falsehood, shall receive the
        fruits of his own labors.  || 17 ||   Do not heat your body like
        a furnace, or burn your bones like firewood. <br>

      <p> What have your head and feet done wrong? See your Husband Lord
        within yourself.  || 18 ||   God the Cosmic Husband dwells within
        all hearts; without Him, there is no heart at all. O Nanak, the
        Gurmukhs are the happy, virtuous soul-brides; the Lord is revealed
        to them.  || 19 ||   If you desire to play this game of love with
        Me, then step onto My Path with your head in hand. When you place
        your feet on this Path, give Me your head, and do not pay any
        attention to public opinion.  || 20 ||   False is friendship with
        the false and gredy. False is its foundation. O Mullah, no one
        knows where death shall strike.  || 21 ||   Without spiritual
        wisdom, the people worship ignorance. They grope in the darkness,
        in the love of duality.  || 22 ||   Without the Guru, there is
        no spiritual wisdom; without Dharma, there is no meditation. Without
        Truth, there is no credit; without capital, there is no balance.
        || 23 ||   The mortals are sent into the world; then, they arise
        and depart. There is no joy in this.  || 24 ||   Raam Chand, sad
        at heart, assembled his army and forces. The army of monkeys was
        at his service; his mind and body became eager for war. Raawan
        captured his wife Sita, and Lachhman was cursed to die. O Nanak,
        the Creator Lord is the Doer of all; He watches over all, and
        destroys what He has created.  || 25 ||   In his mind, Raam Chand
        mourned for Sita and Lachhman. Then, he remembered Hanuman the
        monkey-god, who came to him. The misguided demon did not understand
        that God is the Doer of deeds. O Nanak, the actions of the Self-existent
        Lord cannot be erased.  || 26 ||   The city of Lahore suffered
        terrible destruction for four hours.  || 27 ||   THIRD MEHL: 
        The city of Lahore is a pool of ambrosial nectar, the home of
        praise.  || 28 ||   FIRST MEHL:  What are the signs of a prosperous
        person? His stores of food never run out. Prosperity dwells in
        his home, with the sounds of girls and women. All the women of
        his home shout and cry and over useless things. Whatever he takes,
        he does not give back. Seeking to earn more and more, he is troubled
        and uneasy.  || 29 ||   O lotus, your leaves were green, and your
        blossoms were gold. What pain has burnt you, and made your body
        black? O Nanak, my body is battered. I have not received that
        water which I love. Seeing it, my body blossomed forth, and I
        was blessed with a deep and beautiful color.  || 30 ||   No one
        lives long enough to accomplish all he wishes. Only the spiritually
        wise live forever; they are honored for their intuitive awareness.
        Bit by bit, life passes away, even though the mortal tries to
        hold it back. O Nanak, unto whom should we complain? Death takes
        one's life away without anyone's consent.  || 31
        ||   Do not blame the Sovereign Lord; when someone grows old,
        his intellect leaves him. The blind man talks and babbles, and
        then falls into the ditch.  || 32 ||   All that the Perfect Lord
        does is perfect; there is not too little, or too much. O Nanak,
        knowing this as Gurmukh, the mortal merges into the Perfect Lord
        God.  || 33 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Do not call the wandering beggars holy men,
        if their minds are filled with doubt. Whoever gives to them, O
        Nanak, earns the same sort of merit.  || 1 ||   One who begs for
        the supreme status of the Fearless and Immaculate Lord -
        how rare are those who have the opportunity, O Nanak, to give
        food to such a person.  || 2 ||   If I were a religious scholar,
        an astrologer, or one who could recite the four Vedas, I could
        be famous throughout the nine regions of the earth, for my wisdom
        and thoughtful contemplation.  || 3 ||   If a Brahmin kills a
        cow or a female infant, and accepts the offerings of an evil person,
        he is cursed with the leprosy of curses and criticism; he is forever
        and ever filled with egotistical pride. One who forgets the Naam,
        O Nanak, is covered by countless sins. Let all wisdom be burnt
        away, except for the essence of spiritual wisdom.  || 4 ||   No
        one can erase that primal destiny written upon one's forehead.
        O Nanak, whatever is written there, comes to pass. He alone understands,
        who is blessed by God's Grace.  || 5 ||   Those who forget
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and become attached to greed and
        fraud, are engrossed in the entanglements of Maya the enticer,
        with the fire of desire within them. Those who, like the pumpkin
        vine, are too stubborn climb the trellis, are cheated by Maya
        the cheater. The self-willed manmukhs are bound and gagged and
        led away; the dogs do not join the herd of cows. The Lord Himself
        misleads the misguided ones, and He Himself unites them in His
        Union. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved; they walk in harmony with
        the Will of the True Guru.  || 6 ||   I praise the Praiseworthy
        Lord, and sing the Praises of the True Lord. O Nanak, the One
        Lord alone is True; stay away from all other doors.  || 7 || 
        O Nanak, wherever I go, I find the True Lord. Wherever I look,
        I see the One Lord. He reveals Himself to the Gurmukh.  || 8 ||
        The Word of the Shabad is the Dispeller of sorrow, if one enshrines
        it in the mind. By Guru's Grace, it dwells in the mind;
        by God's Mercy, it is obtained.  || 9 ||   O Nanak, acting
        in egotism, countless thousands have wasted away to death. Those
        who meet with the True Guru are saved, through the Shabad, the
        True Word of the Inscrutable Lord.  || 10 ||   Those who serve
        the True Guru single-mindedly - I fall at the feet of those
        humble beings. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the
        Lord abides in the mind, and the hunger for Maya departs. Immaculate
        and pure are those humble beings, who, as Gurmukh, merge in the
        Naam. O Nanak, other empires are false; they alone are true emperors,
        who are imbued with the Naam.  || 11 ||   The devoted wife in
        her husband's home has a great longing to perform loving
        devotional service to him; she prepares and offers to him all
        sorts of sweet delicacies and dishes of all flavors. In the same
        way, the devotees praise the Word of the Guru's Bani, and
        focus their consciousness on the Lord's Name. They place
        mind, body and wealth in offering before the Guru, and sell their
        heads to Him. <br>

      <p> In the Fear of God, His devotees yearn for His devotional worship;
        God fulfills their desires, and merges them with Himself. My Lord
        God is Self-existent and Independent. What does He need to eat
        to be satisfied? Whoever walks in harmony with the Will of the
        True Guru, and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, is pleasing
        to Him. Blessed, blessed are they, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,
        O Nanak, who walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. 
        || 12 ||   Those who do not serve the True Guru, and do not keep
        the Shabad enshrined in their hearts - cursed are their
        lives. Why did they even come into the world? If one follows the
        Guru's Teachings, and keeps the Fear of God in his mind,
        then he is lovingly attuned to the sublime essence of the Lord.
        By his primal destiny, he obtains the Name; O Nanak, he is carried
        across.  || 13 ||   The world wanders lost in emotional attachment
        to Maya; it does not realize that its own home is being plundered.
        The self-willed manmukh is blind in the world; his mind is lured
        away by sexual desire and anger. With the sword of spiritual wisdom,
        kill the five demons. Remain awake and aware to the Guru's
        Teachings. The Jewel of the Naam is revealed, and the mind and
        body are purified. Those who lack the Naam wander around lost,
        with their noses cut off; without the Name, they sit and cry.
        O Nanak, no one can erase that which is pre-ordained by the Creator
        Lord.  || 14 ||   The Gurmukhs earn the wealth of the Lord, contemplating
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. They receive the wealth
        of the Naam; their treasures are overflowing. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Bani, they utter the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord, whose end and limitations cannot be found. O Nanak,
        the Creator is the Doer of all; the Creator Lord beholds all.
        || 15 ||   Within the Gurmukh is intuitive peace and poise; his
        mind ascends to the Tenth Plane of the Akaashic Ethers. No one
        is sleepy or hungry there; they dwell in the peace of the Ambrosial
        Name of the Lord. O Nanak, pain and pleasure do not afflict anyone,
        where the Light of the Lord, the Supreme Soul, illuminates.  ||
        16 ||   All have come, wearing the robes of sexual desire and
        anger. Some are born, and some pass away. They come and go according
        to the Hukam of the Lord's Command. Their comings and goings
        in reincarnation do not end; they are imbued with the love of
        duality. Bound in bondage, they are made to wander, and they cannot
        do anything about it.  || 17 ||   Those, upon whom the Lord showers
        His Mercy, come and meet the True Guru. Meeting with the True
        Guru, they turn away from the world; they remain dead while still
        alive, with intuitive peace and poise. O Nanak, the devotees are
        imbued with the Lord; they are absorbed in the Name of the Lord.
        || 18 ||   The intellect of the self-willed manmukh is fickle;
        he is very tricky and clever within. Whatever he has done, and
        all that he does, is useless. Not even an iota of it is acceptable.
        The charity and generosity he pretends to give will be judged
        by the Righteous Judge of Dharma. Without the True Guru, the Messenger
        of Death does not leave the mortal alone; he is ruined by the
        love of duality. Youth slips away imperceptibly, old age comes,
        and then he dies. The mortal is caught in love and emotional attachment
        to children and spouse, but none of them will be his helper and
        support in the end. Whoever serves the True Guru finds peace;
        the Name comes to abide in the mind. O Nanak, great and very fortunate
        are those who, as Gurmukh, are absorbed in the Naam.  || 19 ||
        The self-willed manmukhs do not even think of the Name; without
        the Name, they cry in pain. <br>

      <p> They do not worship the Lord, the Supreme Soul; how can they find
        peace in duality? They are filled with the filth of egotism; they
        do not wash it away with the Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, without
        the Name, they die in their filth; they waste the priceless opportunity
        of this human life.  || 20 ||   The self-willed manmukhs are deaf
        and blind; they are filled with the fire of desire. They have
        no intuitive understanding of the Guru's Bani; they are
        not illumined with the Shabad. They do not know their own inner
        being, and they have no faith in the Guru's Word. The Word
        of the Guru's Shabad is within the being of the spiritually
        wise ones. I am forever a sacrifice to them. Servant Nanak is
        the slave of those Gurmukhs who serve the Lord.  || 21 ||   The
        poisonous snake, the serpent of Maya, has surrounded the world
        with its coils, O mother! The antidote to this poisonous venom
        is the Name of the Lord; the Guru places the magic spell of the
        Shabad into the mouth. Those who are blessed with such pre-ordained
        destiny come and meet the True Guru. Meeting with the True Guru,
        they become immaculate, and the poison of egotism is eradicated.
        Radiant and bright are the faces of the Gurmukhs; they are honored
        in the Court of the Lord. Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice
        to those who walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. 
        || 22 ||   The True Guru, the Primal Being, has no hatred or vengeance.
        His heart is constantly attuned to the Lord. Whoever directs hatred
        against the Guru, who has no hatred at all, only sets his own
        home on fire. Anger and egotism are within him night and day;
        he burns, and suffers constant pain. They babble and tell lies,
        and keep on barking, eating the poison of the love of duality.
        For the sake of the poison of Maya, they wander from house to
        house, and lose their honor. They are like the son of a prostitute,
        who does not know the name of his father. They do not remember
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; the Creator Himself brings them
        to ruin. The Lord showers His Mercy upon the Gurmukhs, and reunites
        the separated ones with Himself. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice
        to those who fall at the Feet of the True Guru.  || 23 ||   Those
        who are attached to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are saved;
        without the Name, they must go to the City of Death. O Nanak,
        without the Name, they find no peace; they come and go in reincarnation
        with regrets.  || 24 ||   When anxiety and wanderings come to
        an end, the mind becomes happy. By Guru's Grace, the soul-bride
        understands, and then she sleeps without worry. Those who have
        such pre-ordained destiny meet with the Guru, the Lord of the
        Universe. O Nanak, they merge intuitively into the Lord, the Embodiment
        of Supreme Bliss.  || 25 ||   Those who serve their True Guru,
        who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad, who honor
        and obey the Will of the True Guru, who keep the Lord's
        Name enshrined within their hearts, are honored, here and hereafter;
        they are dedicated to the business of the Lord's Name.
        Through the Word of the Shabad, the Gurmukhs gain recognition
        in that Court of the True Lord. The True Name is their merchandise,
        the True Name is their expenditure; the Love of their Beloved
        fills their inner beings. <br>

      <p> The Messenger of Death does not even approach them; the Creator
        Lord Himself forgives them. O Nanak, they alone are wealthy, who
        are imbued with the Naam; the rest of the world is poor.  || 26
        ||   The Lord's Name is the Support of the Lord's
        humble servants. Without the Lord's Name, the there is
        no other place, no place of rest. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, the Name abides in the mind, and one is intuitively,
        automatically absorbed in the Lord. Those with great good fortune
        meditate on the Naam; night and day, they embrace love for the
        Name. Servant Nanak begs for the dust of their feet; I am forever
        a sacrifice to them.  || 27 ||   The 8.4 million species of beings
        burn in desire and cry in pain. All this show of emotional attachment
        to Maya shall not go with you at that very last instant. Without
        the Lord, peace and tranquility do not come; unto whom should
        we go and complain? By great good fortune, one meets the True
        Guru, and comes to understand the contemplation of God. The fire
        of desire is totally extinguished, O servant Nanak, enshrining
        the Lord within the heart.  || 28 ||   I make so many mistakes,
        there is no end or limit to them. O Lord, please be merciful and
        forgive me; I am a sinner, a great offender. O Dear Lord, if You
        made an account of my mistakes, my turn to be forgiven would not
        even come. Please forgive me, and unite me with Yourself. The
        Guru, in His Pleasure, has united me with the Lord God; He has
        cut away all my sinful mistakes. Servant Nanak celebrates the
        victory of those who meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        || 29 ||   Those who have been separated and alienated from the
        Lord are united with Him again, through the Fear and the Love
        of the True Guru. They escape the cycle of birth and death, and,
        as Gurmukh, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Joining
        the Saadh Sangat, the Guru's Congregation, the diamonds
        and jewels are obtained. O Nanak, the jewel is priceless; the
        Gurmukhs seek and find it.  || 30 ||   The self-willed manmukhs
        do not even think of the Naam. Cursed are their lives, and cursed
        are their homes. That Lord who gives them so much to eat and wear
        - they do not enshrine that Lord, the Treasure of Virtue,
        in their minds. This mind is not pierced by the Word of the Shabad;
        how can it come to dwell in its true home? The self-willed manmukhs
        are like discarded brides, ruined by coming and going in the cycle
        of reincarnation. The Gurmukhs are embellished and exalted by
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the jewel of destiny is engraved
        upon their foreheads. they enshrine the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, within their hearts; the Lord illumines their heart-lotus.
        I am forever a sacrifice to those who serve their True Guru. O
        Nanak, radiant and bright are the faces of those whose inner beings
        are illuminated with the Light of the Naam.  || 31 ||   Those
        who die in the Word of the Shabad are saved. Without the Shabad,
        no one is liberated. They wear religious robes and perform all
        sorts of rituals, but they are ruined; in the love of duality,
        their world is ruined. O Nanak, without the True Guru, the Name
        is not obtained, even though one may long for it hundreds of times.
        || 32 ||   The Name of the Lord is utterly great, lofty and high,
        the highest of the high. No one can climb up to it, even though
        one may long for it, hundreds of times. Speaking about self-discipline,
        no one become pure; everyone walks around wearing religious robes.
        Those blessed by the karma of good deeds go and climb the ladder
        of the Guru. The Lord comes and dwells within that one who contemplates
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. <br>

      <p> O Nanak, when someone dies in the Word of the Shabad, the mind
        is pleased and appeased. True is the reputation of those who are
        true.  || 33 ||   Emotional attachment to Maya is a treacherous
        ocean of pain and poison, which cannot be crossed. Screaming,
  &quot;Mine, mine!&quot;, they rot and die; they pass their
        lives in egotism. The self-willed manmukhs are in limbo, neither
        on this side, nor the other; they are stuck in the middle. They
        act as they are pre-destined; they cannot do anything else. Following
        the Guru's Teachings, the jewel of spiritual wisdom abides
        in the mind, and then God is easily seen in all. O Nanak, the
        very fortunate ones embark on the Boat of the True Guru; they
        are carried across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 34 ||   Without
        the True Guru, there is no giver who can bestow the Support of
        the Lord's Name. By Guru's Grace, the Name comes
        to dwell in the mind; keep it enshrined in your heart. The fire
        of desire is extinguished, and one finds satisfaction, through
        the Love of the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the
        Lord, when He showers His Mercy.  || 35 ||   Without the Shabad,
        the world is so insane, that it cannot even be described. Those
        who are protected by the Lord are saved; they remain lovingly
        attuned to the Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, the Creator who made
        this making knows everything.  || 36 ||   The Pandits, the religious
        scholars, have grown weary of making fire-offerings and sacrifices,
        making pilgrimages to all the sacred shrines, and reading the
        Puraanas. But they cannot get rid of the poison of emotional attachment
        to Maya; they continue to come and go in egotism. Meeting with
        the True Guru, one's filth is washed off, meditating on
        the Lord, the Primal Being, the All-knowing One. Servant Nanak
        is forever a sacrifice to those who serve their Lord God.  ||
        37 ||   Mortals give great thought to Maya and emotional attachment;
        they harbor great hopes, in greed and corruption. The self-willed
        manmukhs do not become steady and stable; they die and are gone
        in an instant. Only those who are blessed with great good fortune
        meet the True Guru, and leave behind their egotism and corruption.
        Chanting the Name of the Lord, they find peace; servant Nanak
        contemplates the Word of the Shabad.  || 38 ||   Without the True
        Guru, there is no devotional worship, and no love of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. Servant Nanak worships and adores the Naam,
        with love and affection for the Guru.  || 39 ||   Do not trust
        greedy people, if you can avoid doing so. At the very last moment,
        they will deceive you there, where no one will be able to lend
        a helping hand. Whoever associates with the self-willed manmukhs,
        will have his face blackened and dirtied. Black are the faces
        of those greedy people; they lose their lives, and leave in disgrace.
        O Lord, let me join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; may
        the Name of the Lord God abide in my mind. The filth and pollution
        of birth and death is washed away, O servant Nanak, singing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 40 ||   Whatever is pre-destined
        by the Lord God Creator, cannot be erased. Body and soul are all
        His. The Sovereign Lord King cherishes all. The gossipers and
        slanderers shall remain hungry and die, rolling in the dust; their
        hands cannot reach anywhere. Outwardly, they do all the proper
        deeds, but they are hypocrites; in their minds and hearts, they
        practice deception and fraud. </p>
