      <p> The Perfect Guru is honored and celebrated; He has taken away
        the pains of my mind.  || 2 ||   I am the servant and slave of
        my Master; what glorious greatness of His can I describe? The
        Perfect Master, by the Pleasure of His Will, forgives, and then
        one practices Truth. I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who re-unites
        the separated ones.  || 3 ||   The intellect of His servant and
        slave is noble and true; it is made so by the Guru's intellect.
        The intuition of those who are true is beautiful; the intellect
        of the self-willed manmukh is insipid. My mind and body belong
        to You, God; from the very beginning, Truth has been my only support.
        || 4 ||   In Truth I sit and stand; I eat and speak the Truth.
        With Truth in my consciousness, I gather the wealth of Truth,
        and drink in the sublime essence of Truth. In the home of Truth,
        the True Lord protects me; I speak the Words of the Guru's
        Teachings with love.  || 5 ||   The self-willed manmukh is very
        lazy; he is trapped in the wilderness. He is drawn to the bait,
        and continually pecking at it, he is trapped; his link to the
        Lord is ruined. By Guru's Grace, one is liberated, absorbed
        in the primal trance of Truth.  || 6 ||   His slave remains continually
        pierced through with love and affection for God. Without the True
        Lord, the soul of the false, corrupt person is burnt to ashes.
        Abandoning all evil actions, he crosses over in the boat of Truth.
        || 7 ||   Those who have forgotten the Naam have no home, no
        place of rest. The Lord's slave renounces greed and attachment,
        and obtains the Lord's Name. If You forgive him, Lord,
        then He is united with You; Nanak is a sacrifice.  || 8 || 4 ||
        MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  The Lord's slave renounces his egotistical
        pride, through the Guru's Fear, intuitively and easily.
        The slave realizes his Lord and Master; glorious is his greatness!
        Meeting with his Lord and Master, he finds peace; His value cannot
        be desribed.  || 1 ||   I am the slave and servant of my Lord
        and Master; all glory is to my Master. By Guru's Grace,
        I am saved, in the Sanctuary of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The slave has been given the most excellent task, by the Primal
        Command of the Master. The slave realizes the Hukam of His Command,
        and submits to His Will forever. The Lord King Himself grants
        forgiveness; how glorious is His greatness!  || 2 ||   He Himself
        is True, and everything is True; this is revealed through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad. He alone serves You, whom You
        have enjoined to do so. Without serving Him, no one finds Him;
        in duality and doubt, they are ruined.  || 3 ||   How could we
        forget Him from our minds? The gifts which he bestows increase
        day by day. Soul and body, all belong to Him; He infused the breath
        into us. If he shows His Mercy, then we serve Him; serving Him,
        we merge in Truth.  || 4 ||   He alone is the Lord's slave,
        who remains dead while yet alive, and eradicates egotism from
        within. His bonds are broken, the fire of his desire is quenched,
        and he is liberated. The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is within all, but how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, obtain
        it.  || 5 ||   Within the Lord's slave, there is no virtue
        at all; the Lord's slave is totally unworthy. There is
        no Giver as great as You, Lord; You alone are the Forgiver. Your
        slave obeys the Hukam of Your Command; this is the most excellent
        action.  || 6 ||   The Guru is the pool of nectar in the world-ocean;
        whatever one desires, that fruit is obtained. <br>
      </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> The treasure of the Naam brings immortality; enshrine it in your
        heart and mind. Serving the Guru, eternal peace is obtained, by
        those whom the Lord inspires to obey the Hukam of His Command.
        || 7 ||   Gold and silver, and all metals, mix with dust in the
        end. Without the Name, nothing goes along with you; the True Guru
        has imparted this understanding. O Nanak, those who are attuned
        to the Naam are immaculate and pure; they remain merged in the
        Truth.  || 8 || 5 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  The Order is issued,
        and he cannot remain; the permit to stay has been torn up. This
        mind is tied to its faults; it suffers terrible pain in its body.
        The Perfect Guru forgives all the mistakes of the beggar at His
        Door.  || 1 ||   How can he stay here? He must get up and depart.
        Contemplate the Word of the Shabad, and understand this. He alone
        is united, whom You, O Lord, unite. Such is the Primal Command
        of the Infinite Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As You keep me, I
        remain; whatever You give me, I eat. As You lead me, I follow,
        with the Ambrosial Name in my mouth. All glorious greatness rests
        in the hands of my Lord and Master; my mind yearns to unite with
        You.  || 2 ||   Why should anyone praise any other created being?
        That Lord acts and sees. The One who created me, abides within
        my mind; there is no other at all. So praise that True Lord, and
        you shall be blessed with true honor.  || 3 ||   The Pandit, the
        religious scholar, reads, but does not reach the Lord; he is totally
        entangled in worldly affairs. He keeps the company of both virtue
        and vice, tormented by hunger and the Messenger of Death. One
        who is protected by the Perfect Lord, forgets separation and fear.
        || 4 ||   They alone are perfect, O Siblings of Destiny, whose
        honor is certified. Perfect is the intellect of the Perfect Lord.
        True is His glorious greatness. His gifts never run short, although
        those who receive may grow weary of receiving.  || 5 ||   Searching
        the salty sea, one finds the pearl. It looks beautiful for a few
        days, but in the end, it is eaten away by dust. If one serves
        the Guru, the ocean of Truth, the gifts one receives never run
        short.  || 6 ||   They alone are pure, who are pleasing to my
        God; all others are soiled with filth. The filthy become pure,
        when they meet with the Guru, the Philosopher's Stone.
        Who can estimate the value of the color of the true jewel?  ||
        7 ||   Wearing religious robes, the Lord is not obtained, nor
        is He obtained by giving donations at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
        Go and ask the readers of the Vedas; without faith, the world
        is cheated. O Nanak, he alone values the jewel, who is blessed
        with the spiritual wisdom of the Perfect Guru.  || 8 || 6 || 
        MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh, in a fit of passion,
        abandons his home, and is ruined; then, he spies on the homes
        of others. He neglects his household duties, and does not meet
        with the True Guru; he is caught in the whirlpool of evil-mindedness.
        Wandering in foreign lands and reading scriptures, he grows weary,
        and his thirsty desires only increase. His perishable body does
        not remember the Word of the Shabad; like a beast, he fills his
        belly.  || 1 ||   O Baba, this is the way of life of the Sannyaasi,
        the renunciate. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        he is to enshrine love for the One Lord. Imbued with Your Name,
        Lord, he remains satisfied and fulfilled.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        He dyes his robes with saffron dye, and wearing these robes,
        he goes out begging. Tearing his robes, he makes a patched coat,
        and puts the money in his wallet. From house to house he goes
        begging, and tries to teach the world; but his mind is blind,
        and so he loses his honor. He is deluded by doubt, and does not
        remember the Word of the Shabad. <br>

      </p>
      <p> He loses his life in the gamble.  || 2 ||   Without the Guru,
        the fire within is not quenched; and outside, the fire still burns.
        Without serving the Guru, there is no devotional worship. How
        can anyone, by himself, know the Lord? Slandering others, one
        lives in hell; within him is hazy darkness. Wandering to the eixty-eight
        sacred shrines of pilgrimage, he is ruined. How can the filth
        of sin be washed away?  || 3 ||   He sifts through the dust, and
        applies ashes to his body, but he is searching for the path of
        Maya's wealth. Inwardly and outwardly, he does not know
        the One Lord; if someone tells him the Truth, he grows angry.
        He reads the scriptures, but tells lies; such is the intellect
        of one who has no guru. Without chanting the Naam, how can he
        find peace? Without the Name, how can he look good?  || 4 || 
        Some shave their heads, some keep their hair in matted tangles;
        some keep it in braids, while some keep silent, filled with egotistical
        pride. Their minds waver and wander in ten directions, without
        loving devotion and enlightenment of the soul. They abandon the
        Ambrosial Nectar, and drink the deadly poison, driven mad by Maya.
        Past actions cannot be erased; without understanding the Hukam
        of the Lord's Command, they become beasts.  || 5 ||   With
        bowl in hand, wearing his patched coat, great desires well up
        in his mind. Abandoning his own wife, he is engrossed in sexual
        desire; his thoughts are on the wives of others. He teaches and
        preaches, but does not contemplate the Shabad; he is bought and
        sold on the street. With poison within, he pretends to be free
        of doubt; he is ruined and humiliated by the Messenger of Death.
        || 6 ||   He alone is a Sannyaasi, who serves the True Guru,
        and removes his self-conceit from within. He does not ask for
        clothes or food; without asking, he accepts whatever he receives.
        He does not speak empty words; he gathers in the wealth of tolerance,
        and burns away his anger with the Naam. Blessed is such a householder,
        Sannyaasi and Yogi, who focuses his consciousness on the Lord's
        feet.  || 7 ||   Amidst hope, the Sannyaasi remains unmoved by
        hope; he remains lovingly focused on the One Lord. He drinks in
        the sublime essence of the Lord, and so finds peace and tranquility;
        in the home of his own being, he remains absorbed in the deep
        trance of meditation. His mind does not waver; as Gurmukh, he
        understands. He restrains it from wandering out. Following the
        Guru's Teachings, he searches the home of his body, and
        obtains the wealth of the Naam.  || 8 ||   Brahma, Vishnu and
        Shiva are exalted, imbued with contemplative meditation on the
        Naam. The sources of creation, speech, the heavens and the underworld,
        all beings and creatures, are infused with Your Light. All comforts
        and liberation are found in the Naam, and the vibrations of the
        Guru's Bani; I have enshrined the True Name within my heart.
        Without the Naam, no one is saved; O Nanak, with the Truth, cross
        over to the other side.  || 9 || 7 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  Through
        the union of mother and father, the fetus is formed. The egg and
        sperm join together to make the body. Upside-down within the womb,
        it lovingly dwells on the Lord; God provides for it, and gives
        it nourishment there.  || 1 ||   How can he cross over the terrifying
        world-ocean? The Gurmukh obtains the Immaculate Naam, the Name
        of the Lord; the unbearable load of sins is removed.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I have forgotten Your Virtues, Lord; I am insane
        - what can I do now? You are the Merciful Giver, above
        the heads of all. Day and night, You give gifts, and take care
        of all.  || 2 ||   One is born to achieve the four great objectives
        of life. <br>

      </p>
      <p> The spirit has taken up its home in the material world. Driven
        by hunger, it sees the path of Maya's riches; this emotional
        attachment takes away the treasure of liberation.  || 3 ||   Weeping
        and wailing, he does not receive them; he searches here and there,
        and grows weary. Engrossed in sexual desire, anger and egotism,
        he falls in love with his false relatives.  || 4 ||   He eats
        and enjoys, listens and watches, and dresses up to show off in
        this house of death. Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        he does not undersand himself. Without the Lord's Name,
        death cannot be avoided.  || 5 ||   The more attachment and egotism
        delude and confuse him, the more he cries out, &quot;Mine, mine!&quot;,
        and the more he loses out. His body and wealth pass away, and
        he is torn by skepticism and cynicism; in the end, he regrets
        and repents, when the dust falls on his face.  || 6 ||   He grows
        old, his body and youth waste away, and his throat is plugged
        with mucous; water flows from his eyes. He feet fail him, and
        his hands shake and tremble; the faithless cynic does not enshrine
        the Lord in his heart.  || 7 ||   His intellect fails him, his
        black hair turns white, and no one wants to keep him in their
        home. Forgetting the Naam, these are the stigmas which stick to
        him; the Messenger of Death beats him, and drags him to hell.
        || 8 ||   The record of one's past actions cannot be erased;
        who else is to blame for one's birth and death? Without
        the Guru, life and death are pointless; without the Word of the
        Guru's Shabad, life just burns away.  || 9 ||   The pleasures
        enjoyed in happiness bring ruin; acting in corruption is useless
        indulgence. Forgetting the Naam, and caught by greed, he betrays
        his own source; the club of the Righteous Judge of Dharma will
        strike him over the head.  || 10 ||   The Gurmukhs sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord's Name; the Lord God blesses them with
        His Glance of Grace. Those beings are pure, perfect unlimited
        and infinite; in this world, they are the embodiment of the Guru,
        the Lord of the Universe.  || 11 ||   Meditate in remembrance
        on the Lord; meditate and contemplate the Guru's Word,
        and love to associate with the humble servants of the Lord. The
        Lord's humble servants are the embodiment of the Guru;
        they are supreme and respected in the Court of the Lord. Nanak
        seeks the dust of the feet of those humble servants of the Lord.

      <p> <font color="#000000">The double-minded person comes and goes, and
        has numerous friends. The soul-bride is separated from her Lord,
        and she has no place of rest; how can she be comforted?  || 1
        ||   My mind is attuned to the Love of my Husband Lord. I am devoted,
        dedicated, a sacrifice to the Lord; if only He would bless me
        with His Glance of Grace, even for an instant!  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I am a rejected bride, abandoned in my parents' home;
        how can I go to my in-laws now? I wear my faults around my neck;
        without my Husband Lord, I am grieving, and wasting away to death.
        || 2 ||   But if, in my parents' home, I remember my Husband
        Lord, then I will come to dwell in the home of my in-laws yet.
        The happy soul-brides sleep in peace; they find their Husband
        Lord, the treasure of virtue.  || 3 ||   Their blankets and mattresses

      <p> Their life-night passes in misery.  || 4 ||   I have tasted many
        flavors, and worn many robes, but without my Husband Lord, my
        youth is slipping away uselessly; I am separated from Him, and
        I cry out in pain.  || 5 ||   I have heard the True Lord's
        message, contemplating the Guru. True is the home of the True
        Lord; by His Gracious Grace, I love Him.  || 6 ||   The spiritual
        teacher applies the ointment of Truth to his eyes, and sees God,
        the Seer. The Gurmukh comes to know and understand; ego and pride
        are subdued.  || 7 ||   O Lord, You are pleased with those who
        are like Yourself; there are many more like me. O Nanak, the Husband
        does not separate from those who are imbued with Truth.  || 8
        || 1 || 9 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  Neither the sisters, nor the
        sisters-in-law, nor the mothers-in-law, shall remain. The true
        relationship with the Lord cannot be broken; it was established
        by the Lord, O sister soul-brides.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice
        to my Guru; I am forever a sacrifice to Him. Wandering so far
        without the Guru, I grew weary; now, the Guru has united me in
        Union with my Husband Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Aunts, uncles,
        grandparents and sisters-in-law - they all come and go;
        they cannot remain. They are like boatloads of passengers embarking.
        || 2 ||   Uncles, aunts, and cousins of all sorts, cannot remain.
        The caravans are full, and great crowds of them are loading up
        at the riverbank.  || 3 ||   O sister-friends, my Husband Lord
        is dyed in the color of Truth. She who lovingly remembers her
        True Husband Lord is not separated from Him again.  || 4 ||  
        All the seasons are good, in which the soul-bride falls in love
        with the True Lord. That soul-bride, who knows her Husband Lord,
        sleeps in peace, night and day.  || 5 ||   At the ferry, the ferryman
        announces, &quot;O travellers, hurry up and cross over.&quot;
        I have seen them crossing over there, on the boat of the True
        Guru.  || 6 ||   Some are getting on board, and some have already
        set out; some are weighed down with their loads. Those who deal
        in Truth, remain with their True Lord God.  || 7 ||   I am not
        called good, and I see none who are bad. O Nanak, one who conquers
        and subdues his ego, becomes just like the True Lord.  || 8 ||
        2 || 10 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  I do not believe that anyone
        is foolish; I do not believe that anyone is clever. Imbued forever
        with the Love of my Lord and Master, I chant His Name, night and
        day.  || 1 ||   O Baba, I am so foolish, but I am a sacrifice
        to the Name. You are the Creator, You are wise and all-seeing.
        Through Your Name, we are carried across.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The same person is foolish and wise; the same light within has
        two names. The most foolish of the foolish are those who do not
        believe in the Name.  || 2 ||   Through the Guru's Gate,
        the Gurdwara, the Name is obtained. Without the True Guru, it
        is not received. Through the Pleasure of the True Guru's
        Will, the Name comes to dwell in the mind, and then, night and
        day, one remains lovingly absorbed in the Lord.  || 3 ||   In
        power, pleasures, beauty, wealth and youth, one gambles his life
        away. Bound by the Hukam of God's Command, the dice are
        thrown; he is just a piece in the game of chess.  || 4 ||   The
        world is clever and wise, but it is deluded by doubt, and forgets
        the Name; the Pandit, the religious scholar, studies the scriptures,
        but he is still a fool. <br>

      <p> Forgetting the Name, he dwells upon the Vedas; he writes, but
        he is confused by his poisonous corruption.  || 5 ||   He is like
        the crop planted in the salty soil, or the tree growing on the
        river bank, or the white clothes sprinkled with dirt. This world
        is the house of desire; whoever enters it, is burnt down by egotistical
        pride.  || 6 ||   Where are all the kings and their subjects?
        Those who are immersed in duality are destroyed. Says Nanak, these
        are the steps of the ladder, of the Teachings of the True Guru;
        only the Unseen Lord shall remain.  || 7 || 3 || 11 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">One whose mind is filled with the Lord's
        Love, is intuitively exalted by the True Word of the Shabad. He
        alone knows the pain of this love; what does anyone else know
        about its cure?  || 1 ||   He Himself unites in His Union. He
        Himself inspires us with His Love. He alone appreciates the value
        of Your Love, upon whom You shower Your Grace, O Lord.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   One whose spiritual vision is awakened - his
        doubt is driven out. By Guru's Grace, he obtains the supreme
        status. He alone is a Yogi, who understands this way, and contemplates
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 2 ||   By good destiny,
        the soul-bride is united with her Husband Lord. Following the
        Guru's Teachings, she eradicates her evil-mindedness from
        within. With love, she continually enjoys pleasure with Him; she
        becomes the beloved of her Husband Lord.  || 3 ||   Other than
        the True Guru, there is no physician. He Himself is the Immaculate
        Lord. Meeting with the True Guru, evil is conquered, and spiritual
        wisdom is contemplated.  || 4 ||   One who is committed to this
        most sublime Shabad becomes Gurmukh, and is rid of thirst and
        hunger. By one's own efforts, nothing can be accomplished;
        the Lord, in His Mercy, bestows power.  || 5 ||   The True Guru
        has revealed the essence of the Shaastras and the Vedas. In His
        Mercy, He has come into the home of my self. In the midst of Maya,
        the Immaculate Lord is known, by those upon whom You bestow Your
        Grace.  || 6 ||   One who becomes Gurmukh, obtains the essence
        of reality; he eradictes his self-conceit from within. Without
        the True Guru, all are entangled in worldly affairs; consider
        this in your mind, and see.  || 7 ||   Some are deluded by doubt;
        they strut around egotistically. Some, as Gurmukh, subdue their
        egotism. Attuned to the True Word of the Shabad, they remain detached
        from the world. The other ignorant fools wander, confused and
        deluded by doubt.  || 8 ||   Those who have not become Gurmukh,
        and who have not found the Naam, the Name of the Lord -
        those self-willed manmukhs waste their lives uselessly. In the
        world hereafter, nothing except the Name will be of any assistance;
        this is understood by contemplating the Guru.  || 9 ||   The Ambrosial
        Naam is the Giver of peace forever. Throughout the four ages,
        it is known through the Perfect Guru. He alone receives it, unto
        whom You bestow it; this is the essence of reality which Nanak
        has realized.  || 10 || 1 || <br>

        to obtain.  || 1 ||   You fool! You are attached and clinging
        to such trivial pleasures! The Ambrosial Nectar abides with you,
        but you are engrossed in sin and corruption.  || 1 ||  Pause

        only barren soil.  || 2 ||   That home within which you live -
        you have not kept that home in your thoughts.  || 3 ||   He is
        immovable, indestructible, the Giver of peace to the soul; and
        yet you do not sing His Praises, even for an instant.  || 4 ||
        You have forgotten that place where you must go; you have not
        attached your mind to the Lord, even for an instant.  || 5 ||
        Gazing upon your children, spouse, household and paraphernalia,
        you are entangled in them.  || 6 ||   As God links the mortals,
        so are they linked, and so are the deeds they do.  || 7 ||   When
        He becomes Merciful, then the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, is found; servant Nanak meditates on God.  || 8 || 1 ||
        MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  Granting His Grace, He has protected me;
        I have found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. My tongue
        lovingly chants the Lord's Name; this love is so sweet
        and intense!  || 1 ||   He is the place of rest for my mind, my
        friend, companion, associate and relative; He is the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He created the world-ocean;
        I seek the Sanctuary of that God. By Guru's Grace, I worship
        and adore God; the Messenger of Death can't say anything
        to me.  || 2 ||   Emancipation and liberation are at His Door;
        He is the treasure in the hearts of the Saints. The all-knowing
        Lord and Master shows us the true way of life; He is our Savior
        and Protector forever.  || 3 ||   Pain, suffering and troubles
        are eradicated, when the Lord abides in the mind. Death, hell
        and the most horrible dwelling of sin and corruption cannot even
        touch such a person.  || 4 ||   Wealth, miraculous spiritual powers
        and the nine treasures come from the Lord, as do the streams of
        Ambrosial Nectar. In the beginning, in the middle, and in the
        end, He is perfect, lofty, unapproachable and unfathomable.  ||
        5 ||   The Siddhas, seekers, angelic beings, silent sages, and
        the Vedas speak of Him. Meditating in remembrance on the Lord
        and Master, celestial peace is enjoyed; He has no end or limitation.
        || 6 ||   Countless sins are erased in an instant, meditating
        on the Benevolent Lord within the heart. Such a person becomes
        the purest of the pure, and is blessed with the merits of millions
        of donations to charity and cleansing baths.  || 7 ||   God is
        power, intellect, understanding, the breath of life, wealth, and
        everything for the Saints. May I never forget Him from my mind,
        even for an instant - this is Nanak's prayer.  ||
        8 || 2 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  The sharp tool cuts down the tree,
        but it does not feel anger in its mind. It serves the purpose
        of the cutter, and does not blame him at all.  || 1 ||   O my
        mind, continually, continuously, meditate on the Lord. The Lord
        of the Universe is merciful, divine and compassionate. <br>

        the fatigue of his body is relieved. The great ocean does not
        even affect him; in an instant, he arrives on the other shore.
        || 2 ||   Sandalwood, aloe, and camphor-paste - the earth
        does not love them. But it doesn't mind, if someone digs
        it up bit by bit, and applies manure and urine to it.  || 3 ||
        High and low, bad and good - the comforting canopy of
        the sky stretches evenly over all. It knows nothing of friend
        and enemy; all beings are alike to it.  || 4 ||   Blazing with
        its dazzling light, the sun rises, and dispels the darkness. Touching
        both the pure and the impure, it harbors no hatred to any.  ||

        the fire - his cold is taken away. It knows nothing of
        its own or others'; it is constant in the same quality.

        Lord - his mind is attuned to the Love of the Beloved.
        Constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World,

        sees the Lord in each and every heart.  || 4 ||   Within the world,
        one is afflicted by skepticism; he does not know the imperceptible

        does not know the One who created him; he is blind, and so he
        shall suffer.  || 5 ||   Forgetting the Creator Lord, he is ruined.
        The drama of the world is bad; it brings sadness and then happiness.
        One who does not meet the Saint does not have faith or contentment;
        he wanders just as he pleases.  || 6 ||   The Lord Himself stages
        all this drama. Some, he lifts up, and some he throws into the
        waves. As He makes them dance, so do they dance. Everyone lives
        their lives according to their past actions.  || 7 ||   When the
        Lord and Master grants His Grace, then we meditate on Him. In
        the Society of the Saints, one is not consigned to hell. Please
        bless Nanak with the gift of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the
        Lord; he continually sings the songs of Your Glories.  || 8 ||

      <p> <font color="#000000">The True Lord is True; there is no other at
        all. He who created, shall in the end destroy. As it pleases You,
        so You keep me, and so I remain; what excuse could I offer to
        You?  || 1 ||   You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy.
        You yourself link each and every person to their tasks. You contemplate
        Yourself, You Yourself make us worthy; You Yourself place us on
        the Path.  || 2 ||   You Yourself are all-wise, You Yourself are
        all-knowing. You Yourself created the Universe, and You are pleased.
        You Yourself are the air, water and fire; You Yourself unite in
        Union.  || 3 ||   You Yourself are the moon, the sun, the most
        perfect of the perfect. You Yourself are spiritual wisdom, meditation,
        and the Guru, the Warrior Hero. The Messenger of Death, and his
        noose of death, cannot touch one, who is lovingly focused on You,
        O True Lord.  || 4 ||   You Yourself are the male, and You Yourself
        are the female. You Yourself are the chess-board, and You Yourself
        are the chessman. You Yourself staged the drama in the arena of
        the world, and You Yourself evaluate the players.  || 5 ||   You
        Yourself are the bumble bee, the flower, the fruit and the tree.
        You Yourself are the water, the desert, the ocean and the pool.
        You Yourself are the great fish, the tortoise, the Cause of causes;
        Your form cannot be known.  || 6 ||   You Yourself are the day,
        and You Yourself are the night. You Yourself are pleased by the
        Word of the Guru's Bani. From the very beginning, and throughout
        the ages, the unstruck sound current resounds, night and day;
        in each and every heart, the Word of the Shabad, echoes Your Will.
        || 7 ||   You Yourself are the jewel, incomparably beautiful
        and priceless. You Yourself are the Assessor, the Perfect Weigher. <br>

      <p> You Yourself test and forgive. You Yourself give and take, O Siblings
        of Destiny.  || 8 ||   He Himself is the bow, and He Himself is
        the archer. He Himself is all-wise, beautiful and all-knowing.
        He is the speaker, the orator and the listener. He Himself made
        what is made.  || 9 ||   Air is the Guru, and water is known to
        be the father. The womb of the great mother earth gives birth
        to all. Night and day are the two nurses, male and female; the
        world plays in this play.  || 10 ||   You Yourself are the fish,
        and You Yourself are the net. You Yourself are the cows, and You
        yourself are their keeper. Your Light fills all the beings of
        the world; they walk according to Your Command, O God.  || 11
        ||   You Yourself are the Yogi, and You Yourself are the enjoyer.
        You Yourself are the reveller; You form the supreme Union. You
        Yourself are speechless, formless and fearless, absorbed in the
        primal ecstasy of deep meditation.  || 12 ||   The sources of
        creation and speech are contained within You, Lord. All that is
        seen, is coming and going. They are the true bankers and traders,
        whom the True Guru has inspired to understand.  || 13 ||   The
        Word of the Shabad is understood through the Perfect True Guru.
        The True Lord is overflowing with all powers. You are beyond our
        grasp, and forever independent. You do not have even an iota of
        greed.  || 14 ||   Birth and death are meaningless, for those
        who enjoy the sublime celestial essence of the Shabad within their
        minds. He Himself is the Giver of liberation, satisfaction and
        blessings, to those devotees who love Him in their minds.  ||
        15 ||   He Himself is immaculate; by contact with the Guru, spiritual
        wisdom is obtained. Whatever is seen, shall merge into You. Nanak,
        the lowly, begs for charity at Your Door; please, bless him with
        the glorious greatness of Your Name.  || 16 || 1 ||   MARU,  FIRST
        MEHL:  He Himself is the earth, the mythical bull which supports
        it and the Akaashic ethers. The True Lord Himself reveals His
        Glorious Virtues. He Himself is celibate, chaste and contented;
        He Himself is the Doer of deeds.  || 1 ||   He who created the
        creation, beholds what He has created. No one can erase the Inscription
        of the True Lord. He Himself is the Doer, the Cause of causes;
        He Himself is the One who bestows glorious greatness.  || 2 ||
        The five thieves cause the fickle consciousness to waver. It
        looks into the homes of others, but does not search its own home.
        The body-village crumbles into dust; without the Word of the Shabad,
        one's honor is lost.  || 3 ||   One who realizes the Lord
        through the Guru, comprehends the three worlds. He subdues his
        desires, and struggles with his mind. Those who serve You, become
        just like You; O Fearless Lord, You are their best friend from
        infancy.  || 4 ||   You Yourself are the heavenly realms, this
        world and the nether regions of the underworld. You Yourself are
        the embodiment of light, forever young. With matted hair, and
        a horrible, dreadful form, still, You have no form or feature.
        || 5 ||   The Vedas and the Bible do not know the mystery of
        God. He has no mother, father, child or brother. He created all
        the mountains, and levels them again; the Unseen Lord cannot be
        seen.  || 6 ||   I have grown weary of making so many friends.
        No one can rid me of my sins and mistakes. God is the Supreme
        Lord and Master of all the angels and mortal beings; blessed with
        His Love, their fear is dispelled.  || 7 ||   He puts back on
        the Path those who have wandered and strayed. You Yourself make
        them stray, and You teach them again. I cannot see anything except
        the Name. </p>
