      <p> Prays Nanak, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        the whole world is false.  || 1 ||   O king, why are you asleep?
        Why don't you wake up to reality? It is useless to cry and
        whine about Maya, but so many weep and wail. So many weep and
        wail for Maya, the great enticer, but without the Name of the
        Lord, there is no peace. Thousands of clever tricks and efforts
        will not succeed. They go wherever the Lord wills them to go.
        In the beginning, in the end, and in the middle, He is all-pervading
        everywhere; He is in each and every heart. Prays Nanak, those
        who join the Saadh Sangat go to the house of the Lord with honor.
        || 2 ||   O king of the people, you know your palaces and wise
        servants? You shall certainly have to separate from them; your
        attachment to them will cause you to regret. Beholding the phantom
        city, you have gone astray; how can you find stability now? Absorbed
        in things other than the Name of the Lord, this human life is
        wasted in vain. Indulging in egotistical actions, your thirst
        is not quenched. Your desires are not fulfilled, and you do not
        attain spiritual wisdom. Prays Nanak, without the Name of the
        Lord, many have departed with regret.  || 3 ||   Showering His
        blessings, the Lord has made me His own. Grasping my arm, He has
        pulled me out of the mud, and blessed me with the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. Worshipping the Lord in the Saadh Sangat,
        all my sins and sufferings are burnt away. This is the greatest
        religion, and the best act of charity; this alone shall go along
        with you. My tongue chants in adoration the Name of the One Lord
        and Master; my mind and body are drenched in the Lord's Name.
        O Nanak, whoever the Lord unites with Himself, is filled with
        all virtues.  || 4 || 6 || 9 || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        VAAR OF BIHAAGRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  By serving the Guru, peace is obtained;
        do not search for peace anywhere else. The mind is pierced by
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad; it dwells with the Lord forever.
        O Nanak, they alone obtain the Naam, whom the Lord beholds with
        His Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The treasure of God's
        Praise is such a blessed gift; it is used and spent by those to
        whom the Lord gives it. Without the True Guru, it does not come
        to hand; all have grown weary of performing religious rituals.
        O Nanak, the self-willed manmukhs of the world lack this wealth;
        when they are hungry in the next world, what will they have to
        eat there?  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  All are Yours  -  You belong
        to all. You created all. You are pervading within all  -  all
        meditate on You. You accept the devotional worship of those who
        are pleasing to Your Mind. Whatever pleases the Lord God happens;
        all act as You cause them to act. Praise the Lord, the greatest
        of all; He preserves the honor of the humble Saints.  || 1 ||
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, the spiritually wise have conquered
        the world, but the world has conquered everyone. Through the Name,
        their affairs are brought to perfection; whatever will be, will
        be. Under Guru's Instruction, their minds are held steady;
        no one can make them waver. </p>
      <p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> The Lord makes His devotees His own, and resolves their affairs.
        The self-willed manmukhs have been led astray from the very beginning;
        within them lurks greed, avarice and egotism. Their nights and
        days pass in argument and conflict; they do not contemplate the
        Word of the Shabad. The Creator has taken away their common sense
        and understanding, and all their speech is corrupt. No matter
        what they are given, they are not satisfied; within them is desire,
        and the great darkness of ignorance. O Nanak, it is right to break
        with the self-willed manmukhs; to them, emotional attachment to
        Maya is sweet.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  What can fear and skepticism
        do to those, who have given their heads to the Creator, and to
        the True Guru? The Protector Himself has protected their honor
        from the beginning of time. Meeting their Beloved, they find peace;
        they contemplate the True Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, I serve
        the Giver of peace; He Himself is the Assessor.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        All beings and creatures are Yours; You are the wealth of all.
        One unto whom You give, obtains everything; there is no one else
        to rival You. You alone are the Great Giver of all; I offer my
        prayer to You, Lord. One with whom You are pleased, is accepted
        by You; how blessed is such a person! Your wondrous play is pervading
        everywhere. Pain and pleasure are with You.  || 2 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukhs are pleasing to the True Lord; they
        are judged to be true in the True Court. The minds of such friends
        are filled with bliss, as they contemplate the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. They enshrine the Shabad deep within; their pain is dispelled,
        and the Creator blesses them with the Divine Light. O Nanak, the
        Savior Lord shall save them, and shower them with His Mercy. 
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Serve the Guru, and wait upon Him; as you
        work, maintain the Fear of God. As you serve Him, you will become
        like Him, if you walk in harmony with His Will. O Nanak, He Himself
        is everything; there is no other place to go.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        You alone know Your greatness  -  there is no one else as
        great as You. If there were some other rival as great as You,
        then I would speak of him. You alone are as great as You are.
        One who serves You finds peace; who else can compare to You? You
        are all-powerful to destroy and create, O Great Giver; all stand
        begging before You, with their palms pressed together. I see none
        as great as You, O Great Giver; You give in charity to the beings
        of all the continents, worlds, solar systems, nether regions and
        universes.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O mind, you have no
        faith, and you have not embraced love for the Celestial Lord.
        You do not enjoy the sublime taste of the Shabad  -  what Praises
        of the Lord will you stubborn-mindedly sing? O Nanak, one's
        coming into the world is approved, if, as Gurmukh, he merges into
        the True Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The fool does not understand
        his own self; he annoys others with his speech. His underlying
        nature does not leave him; separated from the Lord, he is beaten.
        He has not changed and reformed himself in Fear of the True Guru,
        so that he might merge in the lap of God. </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Night and day, his doubts never stop; without the Word of the
        Shabad, he suffers in pain. Sexual desire, anger and greed are
        very powerful within; he passes his life constantly entangled
        in worldly affairs. His feet, hands, eyes and ears are exhausted;
        his days are numbered, and death is approaching. The True Name
        does not seem sweet to him  -  the Name by which the nine treasures
        are obtained. But if he remains dead while yet alive, then by
        so dying, he truly lives; thus, he attains liberation. But if
        he is not blessed with such pre-destined karma, then without this
        karma, what can he obtain? Meditate on the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, you fool; through the Shabad, you shall obtain salvation
        and wisdom. O Nanak, he alone finds the True Guru, who eradicates
        self-conceit from within.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  One whose consciousness
        is filled with my Lord and Master  -  why should he feel anxious
        about anything? The Lord is the Giver of peace, the Lord of all
        things; why would we turn our faces away from His meditation,
        for a moment, even for an instant? One who meditates on the Lord
        obtains all pleasures and comforts; let's go, each and every
        day, to sit in the Society of the Saints. All the pain, hunger
        and disease of the Lord's servant are eradicated; the bonds
        of all the humble beings are torn away. By the Lord's Grace,
        one becomes the Lord's devotee; beholding the face of the
        Lord's humble devotee, the whole world is saved and carried
        across.  || 4 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Let that tongue, which
        has not tasted the Taste of the Lord, be burnt. O Nanak, one whose
        mind is filled with the Lord, Har, Har  -  his tongue savors
        the Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Let that tongue,
        which has forgotten the Name of the Lord, be burnt. O Nanak, the
        tongue of the Gurmukh chants the Lord's Name, and loves the
        Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord Himself is the
        Master, the servant and the devotee; the Lord Himself is the Cause
        of causes. The Lord Himself beholds, and He Himself rejoices.
        As He pleases, He enjoins us. The Lord places some on the Path,
        and the Lord Himself leads others into the wilderness. The Lord
        is the True Master; True is His justice. He arranges and watches
        all His plays. By Guru's Grace, servant Nanak speaks and
        sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  How rare is the dervish, the Saintly renunciate,
        who understands renunciation. Cursed is the life, and cursed are
        the clothes, of one who wanders around, begging from door to door.
        But if he gives up hope and anxiety and becomes Gurmukh, and takes
        the Name as his charity, then Nanak washes his feet; I am a sacrifice
        to him.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, the tree has one fruit,
        but two birds are perched upon it. They are not seen coming or
        going; these birds have no wings. The soul enjoys all sorts of
        pleasures; through the Word of the Shabad, it remains in Nirvaanaa.
        Imbued with the subtle essence of the fruit of the Lord's
        Name, O Nanak, it bears the True Insignia of God's Grace.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself is the field, and He Himself is
        the farmer. He Himself grows and grinds the grain. He Himself
        cooks it, He Himself puts the food in the dishes, and He Himself
        sits down to eat. </p>

      <p> He Himself is the water, He Himself gives the tooth-pick, and
        He Himself offers the mouthwash. He Himself calls and seats the
        congregation, and He Himself bids them goodbye. One whom the Lord
        Himself blesses with His Mercy  -  the Lord inspires him to
        obey the Hukam of His Command.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:
        Religious rituals are all just entanglements; bad and good are
        bound up with them. Possessiveness and emotional attachment are
        more bonds; children and spouse are entanglements as well. Wherever
        I look, I see the noose of attachment to Maya. O Nanak, without
        the True Name, the world is engrossed in blind dealings.  || 1
        ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The blind receive the Divine Light, when they
        merge with the Will of the True Guru. They break their bonds and
        dwell in Truth, and the darkness of ignorance is dispelled. They
        see that everything belongs to the One who created and fashioned
        the body. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Creator; the Creator
        preserves his honor.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  When the Creator, sitting
        all by Himself, created the Universe, he did not consult with
        any of His servants. So what can anyone take, and what can anyone
        give, since He did not create any other like Himself? Then, after
        forming the Universe, the Creator blessed all with His blessings.
        He Himself instructs us in His service; as Gurmukh, we drink in
        His Ambrosial Nectar. He Himself is formless, and He Himself is
        formed; whatever He Himself does, comes to pass.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukhs serve God forever; night and day, they
        are intuitively absorbed in the Love of the True One. They are
        in bliss forever, singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord;
        in this world and in the next, they keep Him clasped to their
        hearts. Their Beloved dwells deep within; the Creator pre-ordained
        this karma. O Nanak, He blends them into Himself; He Himself showers
        His Mercy upon them.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  By merely talking
        and speaking, He is not found. Night and day, sing His Glorious
        Praises forever. Without His Grace, no one finds Him; many have
        died barking and bewailing. When the mind and body are drenched
        with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord Himself comes
        to dwell in the mind. O Nanak, by His Grace, He is found; He unites
        us in His Union.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself is the Vedas,
        the Puraanas and all the Shaastras; He Himself recites them, and
        He Himself is pleased. He Himself sits down to worship, and He
        Himself creates the world. He Himself is the householder, and
        He Himself is the renunciate; He Himself speaks the Unspoken.
        He Himself is all goodness, and He Himself causes us to act; He
        Himself remains detached. He Himself grants pleasure and pain;
        the Creator Himself bestows His blessings.  || 8 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  O Shaykh, renounce your violent nature; live in
        the Fear of God and give up your madness. Through the Fear of
        the Guru, many have been saved; in this fear, you shall find the
        Fearless One. Pierce your stubborn mind with the Word of the Shabad;
        let peace and tranquility come to abide in your mind. If good
        deeds are done in this state of peace, they are approved by the
        Lord and Master. O Nanak, no one has ever found God through sex
        and anger  -  go, and ask any spiritual teacher.  || 1 || 
        THIRD MEHL: </p>

      </p>
      <p> The self-willed manmukhs are emotionally attached to Maya  - 
        they have no love for the Naam. They practice falsehood, gather
        falsehood, and make falsehood their sustenance. They collect the
        poisonous wealth of Maya, and then die; in the end, it is all
        reduced to ashes. They practice religious rituals, purity and
        austere self-discipline, but within, there is only greed and corruption.
        O Nanak, whatever the self-willed manmukhs do is not acceptable;
        in the Court of the Lord, they are dishonored.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        He Himself created the four sources of creation, and He Himself
        fashioned speech; He Himself created the worlds and solar systems.
        He Himself is the ocean, and He Himself is the sea; He Himself
        puts the pearls in it. By His Grace, He enables some to find them
        -  those whom He makes Gurmukh. He Himself is the terrifying
        world-ocean, and He Himself is the boat; He Himself is the boatman,
        and He Himself ferries us across. The Creator Himself acts, and
        causes us to act; no one else can equal You, Lord.  || 9 ||  
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Service to the True Guru is fruitful, if
        one does so with a sincere mind. The treasure of the Naam is obtained,
        and the mind comes to be free of anxiety. The pains of birth and
        death are eradicated, and the mind is rid of egotism and possessiveness.
        One achieves the ultimate state, and remains absorbed in the True
        One. O Nanak, the True Guru comes and meets those who have such
        pre-ordained destiny.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The True Guru is
        attuned to the Naam; He is the boat in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
        One who becomes Gurmukh crosses over; the True Lord abides within
        him. He remembers the Naam, he gathers in the Naam, and he obtains
        honor through the Naam. Nanak has found the True Guru; by His
        Grace, the Name is obtained.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself is
        the Philosopher's Stone, He Himself is the metal, and He
        Himself is transformed into gold. He Himself is the Lord and Master,
        He Himself is the servant, and He Himself is the Destroyer of
        sins. He Himself enjoys every heart; the Lord Master Himself is
        the basis of all illusion. He Himself is the discerning one, and
        He Himself is the Knower of all; He Himself breaks the bonds of
        the Gurmukhs. Servant Nanak is not satisfied by merely praising
        You, O Creator Lord; You are the Great Giver of peace.  || 10
        ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  Without serving the True Guru, the
        deeds which are done are only chains binding the soul. Without
        serving the True Guru, they find no place of rest. They die, only
        to be born again  -  they continue coming and going. Without
        serving the True Guru, their speech is insipid. They do not enshrine
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in the mind. O Nanak, without
        serving the True Guru, they are bound and gagged, and beaten in
        the City of Death; they depart with blackened faces.  || 1 ||
        THIRD MEHL:  Some wait upon and serve the True Guru; they embrace
        love for the Lord's Name. O Nanak, they reform their lives,
        and save their generations as well.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself
        is the school, He Himself is the teacher, and He Himself brings
        the students to be taught. He Himself is the father, He Himself
        is the mother, and He Himself makes the children wise. In one
        place, He teaches them to read and understand everything, while
        in another place, He Himself makes them ignorant. </p>

      <p> Some, You summon to the Mansion of Your Presence within, when
        they become pleasing to Your Mind, O True Lord. That Gurmukh,
        whom You have blessed with greatness  -  that humble being
        is known and respected in Your True Court.  || 11 ||    SHALOK,
        MARDAANAA:  The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the vessel, filled with
        the wine of sex; the mind is the drinker. Anger is the cup, filled
        with emotional attachment; egotism is the bartender. Drinking
        too much in the company of falsehood and greed, one is ruined.
        So let good deeds be your distillery, and let Truth be the molasses
        you ferment; make the most excellent wine of Truth. Make virtue
        your bread, good conduct the ghee, and modesty the dish of meat.
        As Gurmukh, these are obtained, O Nanak; consuming them, evil
        and corruption depart.  || 1 ||   MARDAANAA:  The body is the
        bottle, self-conceit is the wine, and desire is the company of
        drinking companions. The glass of the mind's longing is filled
        to overflowing with falsehood; the Messenger of Death is the bartender.
        Drinking in this wine, O Nanak, one takes on countless vices and
        corruption. So make spiritual wisdom your molasses, and the Praise
        of God your bread; let the Fear of God be the dish of meat. O
        Nanak, this is the true food; let the True Name be your only Support.
        || 2 ||   If the human body is the pitcher, and self-realization
        is the wine, then the Ambrosial Nectar streams down. Joining the
        Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the glass of the Lord's
        Love is filled with this Ambrosial Nectar; drinking it in, one's
        evil and corruption are eradicated.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself
        is the angelic being, the heavenly herald, and the celestial singer.
        He Himself is the one who explains the six schools of philosophy.
        He Himself is Shiva, Shankara and Mahaysh; He Himself is the Gurmukh,
        who speaks the Unspoken Speech. He Himself is the Yogi, He Himself
        is the Enjoyer of pleasures, and He Himself is the Sannyaasee,
        wandering through the wilderness. He discusses with Himself, and
        He teaches Himself; He Himself is discrete, graceful and wise.
        Staging His own play, He Himself watches it; He Himself is the
        Knower of all beings.  || 12 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  That prayer
        is accepted, which brings the Lord God to my consciousness. Love
        for the Lord wells up within me, and my attachment to Maya is
        burnt away. By Guru's Grace, duality is conquered, and the
        mind becomes stable; I have made contemplative meditation my prayer.
        O Nanak, the self-willed manmukh may recite his prayers, but his
        mind is not focused on it; through birth and death, he is ruined.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  I wandered over the whole world, crying
        out, &quot;Love, O love!&quot;, but my thirst was not quenched.
        O Nanak, meeting the True Guru, my desires are satisfied; I found
        my Husband Lord, when I returned to the home of my own inner being.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself is the supreme essence; He Himself
        is the essence of all. He Himself is the Lord and Master, and
        He Himself is the servant. He Himself created the people of the
        eighteen castes; God Himself acquired His domain. He Himself kills,
        and He Himself redeems; He Himself, in His Kindness, forgives
        us. He is infallible  -  He never makes mistakes; the True
        Lord's justice is totally True. Those whom the Lord Himself
        instructs as Gurmukh  -  duality and doubt depart from within
        them.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  That body, which does
        not meditate in remembrance on the Lord's Name in the Saadh
        Sangat, shall be reduced to dust. </p>

      <p> Cursed and insipid is that body, O Nanak, which does not know
        the One who created it.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Let His Lotus
        Feet abide within your heart, and with your tongue, chant the
        Name of the Lord of the World. O Nanak, meditate in remembrance
        on God, and nurture this body of yours.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The
        Creator Himself is the sixty-eight sacred places of pilgrimage;
        He Himself takes the cleansing bath there. He Himself practices
        austere self-discipline; the Lord and Master Himself inspires
        us to chant His Name. He Himself becomes merciful; the Destroyer
        of fear Himself gives in charity to all. One whom He has enlightened
        and made Gurmukh, obtains honor forever in His Court. One whose
        honor is preserved by his Lord and Master, comes to know the True
        Lord.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, without meeting
        the True Guru, the world is blind; in blindness, it does its deeds.
        It does not focus its consciousness on the Word of the Shabad,
        which would bring peace to abide in the mind. Always afflicted
        with the dark passions of low energy, it wanders around, passing
        its days and nights burning. Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass;
        no one has any say in this.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The True Guru
        has commanded us to do this: through the Guru's Gate, meditate
        on your Lord and Master. The Lord and Master is ever-present.
        He rips away the veil of doubt, and installs His Light deep within.
        The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial Nectar  -  take this healing
        medicine! Enshrine the Will of the True Guru in your consciousness,
        and make the Love of the True One your self-discipline. O Nanak,
        you shall be kept in peace here, and hereafter you shall celebrate
        with the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself is the vast variety
        of Nature, and He Himself makes it bear fruit. He Himself is the
        Gardener, He Himself irrigates all the plants, and He Himself
        puts them in His mouth. He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself
        is the Enjoyer; He Himself gives, and inspires others to give.
        He Himself is the Lord and Master, and He Himself is the Protector;
        He Himself is pervading everywhere. Servant Nanak speaks of the
        greatness of the Lord, the Creator, who has no greed at all. 
        || 15 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  One person brings a full bottle,
        and another comes to fill his cup. Drinking it, his intelligence
        departs, and madness enters his mind. He cannot distinguish between
        his own and others'  -  he is struck down by his Lord
        and Master. Drinking it, he forgets his Lord and Master, and he
        is punished in the Court of the Lord. Don't drink the false
        wine at all, if it is in your power. O Nanak, by His Grace, one
        obtains the true wine, when the True Guru comes and meets him.
        He shall dwell forever in the Love of the Lord and Master, and
        obtain a seat in the Mansion of His Presence.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  One remains dead while yet alive in this world, when he
        realizes the Lord. When he is put to sleep, he remains asleep;
        when He is awakened, he regains consciousness. O Nanak, when the
        Lord casts His Glance of Grace, He causes him to meet the True
        Guru. By Guru's Grace, remain dead while yet alive, and you
        shall not have to die again.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  By His doing,
        everything happens; what does He care for anyone else? </p>

      <p> O Dear Lord, everyone eats whatever You give  -  all are subservient
        to You. One who praises You obtains everything, as You grant Your
        Grace, O Immaculate Lord. He alone is a true banker and trader,
        who loads the merchandise of the wealth of Your Name, O Lord.
        O Saints, let everyone praise the Lord, who has destroyed the
        pile of the love of duality.  || 16 ||   SHALOK:  Kabeer, the
        world is dying  -  dying to death, but no one knows how to
        truly die. Whoever dies  -  let him die such a death, that
        he shall never have to die again.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  What
        do I know? How will I die? What sort of death will it be? If I
        don't forget the Lord and Master from my mind, then death
        will be easy. The world is terrified of death; everyone longs
        to live. By Guru's Grace, one who dies while yet alive, understands
        the Hukam of the Lord's Command. O Nanak, one who dies such
        a death, lives forever.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  When the Lord Master
        Himself becomes merciful, the Lord Himself causes His Name to
        be chanted. He Himself leads us to meet the True Guru, and blesses
        us with peace. His servant is pleasing to the Lord. He Himself
        preserves the honor of His servants; He makes others fall at the
        feet of His devotees. The Righteous Judge of Dharma is the creation
        of the Lord; he does not even approach the humble servant of the
        Lord. One who is dear to the Lord, is dear to all; a great many
        others come and go in vain.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL: 
        The whole world wanders around chanting, &quot;Raam, Raam, Lord,
        Lord&quot;, but the Lord cannot be found like this. He is inaccessible,
        unfathomable and utterly great; He is unweighable, and cannot
        be weighed. No one can evaluate Him; He cannot be purchased at
        any price. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, His mystery
        is known; in this way, He comes to dwell in the mind. O Nanak,
        He Himself is infinite; by Guru's Grace, He is known to be
        permeating everywhere. He Himself comes to blend, and having blended,
        remains blended.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O mind, this is the wealth
        of the Naam; it brings peace, forever and ever. It never brings
        any loss at all; through it, one earns profits forever. Eating
        and spending it, it never decreases; He continues to give, forever
        and ever. One who has no skepticism at all, never suffers humiliation.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukh obtains it, when the Lord bestows His Glance
        of Grace.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself is deep within all hearts,
        and He Himself is outside as well. He Himself is prevailing unmanifest,
        and He Himself is manifest as well. For thirty-six ages, He created
        the darkness, abiding in the void. There were no Vedas, Puraanas
        or Shaastras there; only the Lord Himself existed. He Himself
        sat in the absolute trance, withdrawn from everything. Only He
        Himself knows His state; He Himself is the unfathomable ocean.
        || 18 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  In egotism, the world is dead;
        it dies and dies, again and again. </p>

      <p> As long as there is breath in the body, he does not remember God;
        what will he do when he goes beyond? One who remembers the Lord
        is spiritually wise; the ignorant act blindly. O Nanak, whatever
        one does in this world determines what he shall receive in the
        world beyond.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  It is the pre-ordained Command
        of the Lord and Master, that one cannot be conscious of Him without
        the True Guru. Meeting the True Guru, one realizes that the Lord
        is permeating and pervading deep within; he remains forever absorbed
        in the Lord's Love. With each and every breath, he constantly
        remembers the Lord in meditation; not a single breath passes in
        vain. The fear of birth and death departs, and one obtains the
        honored state of eternal life. O Nanak, this rank is bestowed
        upon those whom He showers with His Mercy.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        He Himself is all-wise and all-knowing; He Himself is supreme.
        He Himself reveals His form, and He Himself enjoins us to His
        meditation. He Himself poses as a silent sage, and He Himself
        speaks spiritual wisdom. He does not seem bitter to anyone; He
        is pleasing to all. His Praises cannot be described; I am forever
        and ever a sacrifice to Him.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O Nanak, the Jinn, the demons,
        have taken birth. The son is a demon, the daughter is a demon,
        and the wife is the chief of the demons.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        The Hindus have forgotten the Primal Lord; they are going the
        wrong way. As Naarad instructed them, they worship idols. They
        are blind and mute, the blindest of the blind. The ignorant fools
        pick up stones and worship them. But when those stones themselves
        sink, how will they carry you across?  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Everything
        is in Your power; You are the True King. The devotees are attuned
        to the Love of the One Lord; they have perfect faith in Him. The
        Name of the Lord is the food of ambrosial nectar; His humble servants
        eat their fill. All treasures are obtained  -  meditative remembrance
        is the true profit. The Saints are very dear to the Supreme Lord
        God; O Nanak, the Lord is unapproachable and unfathomable.  ||
        20 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Everything comes by His Command,
        and everything goes by His Command. If some fool believes that
        he does so himself, he is blind, and acts in blindness. O Nanak,
        one who becomes Gurmukh understands the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command; the Lord grants His Grace.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  He
        alone is a Yogi, and he alone finds the Way, who as Gurmukh, has
        found the Naam. In the body-village of that Yogi is everything;
        Yoga is not obtained by outward show and religious robes. O Nanak,
        such a Yogi is very rare; the Lord is revealed in the heart. 
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself created the creatures, and He Himself
        supports them. He Himself is seen to be subtle, and He Himself
        is obvious. He Himself remains a solitary hermit, and He Himself
        has a huge family. Nanak begs for the gift of the dust of the
        feet of the Saints of the Lord. I cannot see any other Giver;
        You alone are the Giver, Lord.  || 21 || 1 ||  SUDH  || <br>
