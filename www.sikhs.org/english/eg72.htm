      <p> Have Mercy upon me, and bless me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy.  || 4 ||   He alone obtains something, who becomes
        the dust under the feet of all. And he alone repeats the Naam,
        whom God causes to understand.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 2 || 8 || 
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Within the home of his own self, he does
        not even come to see his Lord and Master. And yet, around his
        neck, he hangs a stone god.  || 1 ||   The faithless cynic wanders
        around, deluded by doubt. He churns water, and after wasting his
        life away, he dies.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That stone, which he
        calls his god, that stone pulls him down and drowns him.  || 2
        ||   O sinner, you are untrue to your own self; a boat of stone
        will not carry you across.  || 3 ||   Meeting the Guru, O Nanak,
        I know my Lord and Master. The Perfect Architect of Destiny is
        pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky.  ||
        4 || 3 || 9 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  How have you enjoyed your
        Dear Beloved? O sister, please teach me, please show me.  || 1
        ||   Crimson, crimson, crimson - this is the color of the
        soul-bride who is imbued with the Love of her Beloved.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I wash Your Feet with my eye-lashes. Wherever You
        send me, there I will go.  || 2 ||   I would trade meditation,
        austerity, self-discipline and celibacy, if I could only meet
        the Lord of my life, for even an instant.  || 3 ||   She who eradicates
        her self-conceit, power and arrogant intellect, O Nanak, is the
        true soul-bride.  || 4 || 4 || 10 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You
        are my Life, the very Support of my breath of life. Gazing upon
        You, beholding You, my mind is soothed and comforted.  || 1 ||
        You are my Friend, You are my Beloved. I shall never forget
        You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am Your indentured servant; I am
        Your slave. You are my Great Lord and Master, the treasure of
        excellence.  || 2 ||   There are millions of servants in Your
        Court - Your Royal Darbaar. Each and every instant, You
        dwell with them.  || 3 ||   I am nothing; everything is Yours.
        Through and through, You abide with Nanak.  || 4 || 5 || 11 ||
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  His Mansions are so comfortable, and His
        gates are so lofty. Within them, His beloved devotees dwell. 
        || 1 ||   The Natural Speech of God is so very sweet. How rare
        is that person, who sees it with his eyes.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        There, in the arena of the congregation, the divine music of
        the Naad, the sound current, is sung. There, the Saints celebrate
        with their Lord.  || 2 ||   Neither birth nor death is there,
        neither pain nor pleasure. The Ambrosial Nectar of the True Name
        rains down there.  || 3 ||   From the Guru, I have come to know
        the mystery of this speech. Nanak speaks the Bani of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 4 || 6 || 12 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  By the Blessed
        Vision of their Darshan, millions of sins are erased. Meeting
        with them, this terrifying world-ocean is crossed over  || 1 ||
        They are my companions, and they are my dear friends, who inspire
        me to remember the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Hearing
        the Word of His Shabad, I am totally at peace. When I serve Him,
        the Messenger of Death is chased away.  || 2 ||   His comfort
        and consolation soothes and supports my mind. Remembering Him
        in meditation, my face is radiant and bright.  || 3 ||   God embellishes
        and supports His servants. <br>

      <p> Nanak seeks the Protection of their Sanctuary; he is forever a
        sacrifice to them.  || 4 || 7 || 13 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The angelic beings and demi-gods are not permitted to remain
        here. The silent sages and humble servants also must arise and
        depart.  || 1 ||   Only those who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har,
        are seen to live on. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        they obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Kings, emperors and merchants must die. Whoever
        is seen shall be consumed by death.  || 2 ||   Mortal beings are
        entangled, clinging to false worldly attachments. And when they
        must leave them behind, then they regret and grieve.  || 3 ||
        O Lord, O treasure of mercy, please bless Nanak with this gift,
        that he may chant Your Name, day and night.  || 4 || 8 || 14 ||
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You dwell deep within the heart of each
        and every being. The entire universe is strung on Your Thread.
        || 1 ||   You are my Beloved, the Support of my breath of life.
        Beholding You, gazing upon You, my mind blossoms forth.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Wandering, wandering, wandering through countless
        incarnations, I have grown so weary. Now, I hold tight to the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 2 ||   You are inaccessible,
        incomprehensible, invisible and infinite. Nanak remembers You
        in meditation, day and night.  || 3 || 9 || 15 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  What is the use of the glory of Maya? It disappears in
        no time at all.  || 1 ||   This is a dream, but the sleeper does
        not know it. In his unconscious state, he clings to it.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The poor fool is enticed by the great attachments
        of the world. Gazing upon them, watching them, he must still arise
        and depart.  || 2 ||   The Royal Court of His Darbaar is the highest
        of the high. He creates and destroys countless beings.  || 3 ||
        There has never been any other, and there shall never be. O
        Nanak, meditate on the One God.  || 4 || 10 || 16 ||   SOOHEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating, meditating in remembrance on Him, I
        live. I wash Your Lotus Feet, and drink in the wash water.  ||
        1 ||   He is my Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
        My Lord and Master abides with His humble devotees.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Hearing, hearing Your Ambrosial Naam, I meditate on
        it. Twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises.  ||
        2 ||   Beholding, beholding Your divine play, my mind is in bliss.
        Your Glorious Virtues are infinite, O God, O Lord of supreme bliss.
        || 3 ||   Meditating in remembrance on Him, fear cannot touch
        me. Forever and ever, Nanak meditates on the Lord.  || 4 || 11
        || 17 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Within my heart, I meditate on
        the Word of the Guru's Teachings. With my tongue, I chant
        the Chant of the Lord.  || 1 ||   The image of His vision is fruitful;
        I am a sacrifice to it. His Lotus Feet are the Support of the
        mind, the Support of the very breath of life.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the cycle
        of birth and death is ended. To hear the Ambrosial Sermon is the
        support of my ears.  || 2 ||   I have renounced sexual desire,
        anger, greed and emotional attachment. I have enshrined the Naam
        within myself, with charity, true cleansing and righteous conduct.
        || 3 ||   Says Nanak, I have contemplated this essence of reality;
        chanting the Name of the Lord, I am carried across.  || 4 || 12
        || 18 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The sinner is absorbed in greed
        and emotional attachment. <br>

      <p> He has not performed any service to the Creator Lord.  || 1 ||
        O God, Your Name is the Purifier of sinners. I am worthless
        - please save me!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O God, You are
        the Great Giver, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. The
        body of the egotistical human is perishable.  || 2 ||   Tastes
        and pleasures, conflicts and jealousy, and intoxication with Maya
        - attached to these, the jewel of human life is wasted.
        || 3 ||   The Sovereign Lord King is the Destroyer of pain, the
        Life of the world. Forsaking everything, Nanak has entered His
        Sanctuary.  || 4 || 13 || 19 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He sees
        with his eyes, but he is called blind; he hears, but he does not
        hear. And the One who dwells near at hand, he thinks that He is
        far away; the sinner is committing sins.  || 1 ||   Do only those
        deeds which will save you, O mortal being. Chant the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, and the Ambrosial Word of His Bani.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   You are forever imbued with the love of horses and
        mansions. Nothing shall go along with you.  || 2 ||   You may
        clean and decorate the vessel of clay, but it is so very filthy;
        it shall receive its punishment from the Messenger of Death. 
        || 3 ||   You are bound by sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional
        attachment. You are sinking down into the great pit.  || 4 ||
        Hear this prayer of Nanak, O Lord; I am a stone, sinking down
        - please, rescue me!  || 5 || 14 || 20 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  One who remains dead while yet alive understands God. He
        meets that humble being according to the karma of his past actions.
        || 1 ||   Listen, O friend - this is how to cross over
        the terrifying world-ocean. Meet with the Holy, and chant the
        Lord's Name  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   There is no other to
        know, except for the One Lord. So realize that the Supreme Lord
        God is within each and every heart.  || 2 ||   Whatever He does,
        accept that as good. Know the value of the beginning and the end.
        || 3 ||   Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to that humble being,
        within whose heart the Lord dwells.  || 4 || 15 || 21 ||   SOOHEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Creator Lord.
        He gives His Support to the entire Universe.  || 1 ||   Meditate
        within your mind on the Lotus Feet of the Guru. Pain and suffering
        shall leave this body.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The True Guru saves
        the drowning being from the terrifying world-ocean. He reunites
        those who were separated for countless incarnations.  || 2 ||
        Serve the Guru, day and night. Your mind shall come to have
        peace, pleasure and poise.  || 3 ||   By great good fortune, one
        obtains the dust of the feet of the True Guru. Nanak is forever
        a sacrifice to the True Guru.  || 4 || 16 || 22 ||   SOOHEE, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  I am a sacrifice to my True Guru. Twenty-four hours
        a day, I sing the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   Meditate
        in remembrance on God, your Lord and Master. He is the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of all hearts.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So love the
        Lord's Lotus Feet, and live a lifestyle which is true,
        perfect and spotless.  || 2 ||   By the Grace of the Saints, the
        Lord comes to dwell within the mind, and the sins and residues
        of countless incarnations are eradicated.  || 3 ||   Please be
        Merciful, O God, O Merciful to the meek. <br>

      <p> Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints.  || 4 || 17 || 23 ||  
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan,
        I live. My karma is perfect, O my God.  || 1 ||   Please, listen
        to this prayer, O my God. Please bless me with Your Name, and
        make me Your chaylaa, Your disciple.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Please
        keep me under Your Protection, O God, O Great Giver. By Guru's
        Grace, a few people understand this.  || 2 ||   Please hear my
        prayer, O God, my Friend. May Your Lotus Feet abide within my
        consciousness.  || 3 ||   Nanak makes one prayer: may I never
        forget You, O perfect treasure of virtue.  || 4 || 18 || 24 ||
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He is my friend, companion, child, relative
        and sibling. Wherever I look, I see the Lord as my companion and
        helper.  || 1 ||   The Lord's Name is my social status,
        my honor and wealth. He is my pleasure, poise, bliss and peace.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have strapped on the armor of meditation
        on the Supreme Lord God. It cannot be pierced, even by millions
        of weapons.  || 2 ||   The Sanctuary of the Lord's Feet
        is my fortress and battlement. The Messenger of Death, the torturer,
        cannot demolish it.  || 3 ||   Slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice
        to the selfless servants and Saints of the Sovereign Lord, the
        Destroyer of ego.  || 4 || 19 || 25 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Where the Glorious Praises of God, the Lord of the world are
        continually sung, there is bliss, joy, happiness and peace.  ||
        1 ||   Come, O my companions - let us go and enjoy God.
        Let us fall at the feet of the holy, humble beings.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   I pray for the dust of the feet of the humble. It
        shall wash away the sinful residues of countless incarnations.
        || 2 ||   I dedicate my mind, body, breath of life and soul to
        God. Remembering the Lord in meditation, I have eradicated pride
        and emotional attachment.  || 3 ||   O Lord, O Merciful to the
        meek, please give me faith and confidence, so that slave Nanak
        may remain absorbed in Your Sanctuary.  || 4 || 20 || 26 ||  
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The city of heaven is where the Saints dwell.
        They enshrine the Lotus Feet of God within their hearts.  || 1
        ||   Listen, O my mind and body, and let me show you the way to
        find peace, so that you may eat and enjoy the various delicacies
        of the Lord  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Taste the Ambrosial Nectar of
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your mind. Its taste is
        wondrous - it cannot be described.  || 2 ||   Your greed
        shall die, and your thirst shall be quenched. The humble beings
        seek the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God.  || 3 ||   The Lord
        dispels the fears and attachments of countless incarnations. God
        has showered His Mercy and Grace upon slave Nanak.  || 4 || 21
        || 27 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  God covers the many shortcomings
        of His slaves. Granting His Mercy, God makes them His own.  ||
        1 ||   You emancipate Your humble servant, and rescue him from
        the noose of the world, which is just a dream.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Even huge mountains of sin and corruption are removed in
        an instant by the Merciful Lord.  || 2 ||   Sorrow, disease and
        the most terrible calamities are removed by meditating on the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 3 || <br>

      <p> Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He attaches us to the hem of His
        robe. Grasping the Lord's Feet, O Nanak, we enter His Sanctuary.
        || 4 || 22 || 28 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who withdraws
        from God's Path, and attaches himself to the world, is
        known as a sinner in both worlds.  || 1 ||   He alone is approved,
        who pleases the Lord. Only He Himself knows His creative omnipotence.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who practices truth, righteous living,
        charity and good deeds, has the supplies for God's Path.
        Worldly success shall not fail him.  || 2 ||   Within and among
        all, the One Lord is awake. As He attaches us, so are we attached.
        || 3 ||   You are inaccessible and unfathomable, O my True Lord
        and Master. Nanak speaks as You inspire him to speak.  || 4 ||
        23 || 29 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the early hours of the
        morning, I chant the Lord's Name. I have fashioned a shelter
        for myself, hear and hereafter.  || 1 ||   Forever and ever, I
        chant the Lord's Name, and the desires of my mind are fulfilled.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sing the Praises of the Eternal, Imperishable
        Lord God, night and day. In life, and in death, you shall find
        your eternal, unchanging home.  || 2 ||   So serve the Sovereign
        Lord, and you shall never lack anything. While eating and consuming,
        you shall pass your life in peace.  || 3 ||   O Life of the World,
        O Primal Being, I have found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy. By Guru's Grace, O Nanak, I meditate on the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 24 || 30 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        When the Perfect Guru becomes merciful, my pains are taken away,
        and my works are perfectly completed.  || 1 ||   Gazing upon,
        beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I live; I am a sacrifice
        to Your Lotus Feet. Without You, O my Lord and Master, who belongs
        to me?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have fallen in love with the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, by the karma of my past actions
        and my pre-ordained destiny.  || 2 ||   Chant the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har; how wondrous is His glory! The three types of
        illness cannot consume it.  || 3 ||   May I never forget, even
        for an instant, the Lord's Feet. Nanak begs for this gift,
        O my Beloved.  || 4 || 25 || 31 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  May
        there be such an auspicious time, O my Beloved, when, with my
        tongue, I may chant the Lord's Name  || 1 ||   Hear my
        prayer, O God, O Merciful to the meek. The Holy Saints ever sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Source of Nectar.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Your meditation and remembrance is life-giving,
        God. You dwell near those upon whom You show mercy.  || 2 || 
        Your Name is the food to satisfy the hunger of Your humble servants.
        You are the Great Giver, O Lord God.  || 3 ||   The Saints take
        pleasure in repeating the Lord's Name. O Nanak, the Lord,
        the Great Giver, is All-knowing.  || 4 || 26 || 32 ||   SOOHEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Your life is slipping away, but you never even notice.
        You are constantly entangled in false attachments and conflicts.
        || 1 ||   Meditate, vibrate constantly, day and night, on the
        Lord. You shall be victorious in this priceless human life, in

        do not enshrine the jewel of the Lord's Name within your

      <p> Feeding and pampering your body, your life is passing away, but
        you do not experience the state of victory of the Lord of the
        Universe.  || 3 ||   So enter the Sanctuary of the All-powerful,
        Unfathomable Lord and Master. O God, O Searcher of hearts, please,
        save Nanak!  || 4 || 27 || 33 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Cross
        over the terrifying world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy. Remember in meditation the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, the source of jewels.  || 1 ||   Remembering, remembering
        the Lord in meditation, I live. All pain, disease and suffering
        is dispelled, meeting the Perfect Guru; sin has been eradicated.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The immortal status is obtained through
        the Name of the Lord; the mind and body become spotless and pure,
        which is the true purpose of life.  || 2 ||   Twenty-four hours
        a day, meditate on the Supreme Lord God. By pre-ordained destiny,
        the Name is obtained.  || 3 ||   I have entered His Sanctuary,
        and I meditate on the Lord, Merciful to the meek. Nanak longs
        for the dust of the Saints.  || 4 || 28 || 34 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The beautiful one does not know the work of his own home.
        The fool is engrossed in false attachments.  || 1 ||   As You
        attach us, so we are attached. When You bless us with Your Name,
        we chant it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord's slaves are
        imbued with the Love of the Lord. They are intoxicated with the
        Lord, night and day.  || 2 ||   Reaching out to grasp hold of
        our arms, God lifts us up. Separated for countless incarnations,
        we are united with Him again.  || 3 ||   Save me, O God, O my
        Lord and Master - shower me with Your Mercy. Slave Nanak
        seeks Sanctuary at Your Door, O Lord.  || 4 || 29 || 35 ||   SOOHEE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  By the Grace of the Saints, I have found my eternal
        home. I have found total peace, and I shall not waver again. 
        || 1 ||   I meditate on the Guru, and the Lord's Feet,
        within my mind. In this way, the Creator Lord has made me steady
        and stable.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the unchanging, eternal Lord God, and the noose of death is
        snapped.  || 2 ||   Showering His Mercy, he has attached me to
        the hem of His robe. In constant bliss, Nanak sings His Glorious
        Praises.  || 3 || 30 || 36 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Words,
        the Teachings of the Holy Saints, are Ambrosial Nectar. Whoever
        meditates on the Lord's Name is emancipated; he chants
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with his tongue.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The pains and sufferings of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga are
        eradicated, when the One Name abides within the mind.  || 1 ||
        I apply the dust of the feet of the Holy to my face and forehead.
        Nanak has been saved, in the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord.
        || 2 || 31 || 37 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the Merciful Lord. Please,
        bless me with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Perfect, Compassionate
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Please, grant Your Grace, and cherish
        me. My soul and body are all Your property.  || 1 ||   Only meditation
        on the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, will go along with
        you. Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints.  || 2 || 32 || 38
        ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Without Him, there is no other at all.
        The True Lord Himself is our anchor.  || 1 ||   The Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, is our only support. The Creator, the Cause of
        causes, is All-powerful and Infinite.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He
        has eradicated all illness, and healed me. <br>

        of the Lord's Darshan. By perfect destiny, it is obtained.
        ||  Pause  ||   Forsaking the Beautiful Lord, how can they go
        to sleep? The great enticer Maya has led them down the path of
        sin.  || 1 ||   This butcher has separated them from the Beloved
        Lord. This merciless one shows no mercy at all to the poor beings.
        || 2 ||   Countless lifetimes have passed away, wandering aimlessly.
        The terrible, treacherous Maya does not even allow them to dwell
        in their own home.  || 3 ||   Day and night, they receive the
        rewards of their own actions. Don't blame anyone else;
        your own actions lead you astray.  || 4 ||   Listen, O Friend,
        O Saint, O humble Sibling of Destiny: in the Sanctuary of the
        Lord's Feet, Nanak has found Salvation.  || 5 || 34 ||

        - nothing else is of any account. Attach your mind to the
        Saints, and abandon the path of duality.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        The Lord is absolute and unmanifest; He has assumed the most
        sublime manifestation. He has fashioned countless body chambers
        of many, varied, different, myriad forms. Within them, the mind
        is the policeman; my Beloved lives in the temple of my inner self.
        He plays there in ecstasy. He does not die, and he never grows
        old.  || 1 ||   He is engrossed in worldly activities, wandering
        around in various ways. He steals the property of others, and
        is surrounded by corruption and sin. But now, he joins the Saadh

        of enjoying it. He enjoys all the delights, and yet He remains
        unattached.  || 1 ||   He has no color, no sign, no mouth and

        to pass through. It is like a violent wind-storm.  || 1 ||   I
        am so afraid to hear that the Righteous Judge of Dharma is so
        strict and stern.  || 2 ||   The world is a deep, dark pit; it
        is all on fire.  || 3 ||   I have grasped the Support of the Holy

        and bless me with total peace; You Yourself cherish me.  || 2
        ||   The Transcendent Lord has blessed me with His Glance of Grace;
        breaking my bonds, He has delivered me. God Himself inspires me
        to worship Him; He Himself inspires me to serve Him.  || 3 ||
        My doubts have gone, my fears and infatuations have been dispelled,
        and all my sorrows are gone. O Nanak, the Lord, the Giver of peace
        has been merciful to me. I have met the Perfect True Guru.  ||
        4 || 5 || 52 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  When nothing existed,
        what deeds were being done? And what karma caused anyone to be
        born at all? The Lord Himself set His play in motion, and He Himself
        beholds it. He created the Creation.  || 1 ||   O my Sovereign
        Lord, I cannot do anything at all by myself. He Himself is the
        Creator, He Himself is the Cause. He is pervading deep within
        all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If my account were to be judged, I
        would never be saved. My body is transitory and ignorant. Take
        pity upon me, O Creator Lord God; Your Forgiving Grace is singular
        and unique.  || 2 ||   You created all beings and creatures. Each
        and every heart meditates on You. Your condition and expanse are
        known only to You; the value of Your creative omnipotence cannot
        be estimated.  || 3 ||   I am worthless, foolish, thoughtless
        and ignorant. I know nothing about good actions and righteous
        living. Take pity on Nanak, that he may sing Your Glorious Praises;
        and that Your Will may seem sweet to him.  || 4 || 6 || 53 ||
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL: <br>

      <p> Your Saints are very fortunate; their homes are filled with the
        wealth of the Lord's Name. Their birth is approved, and
        their actions are fruitful.  || 1 ||   O my Lord, I am a sacrifice
        to the humble servants of the Lord. I make my hair into a fan,
        and wave it over them; I apply the dust of their feet to my face.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those generous, humble beings are above
        both birth and death. They give the gift of the soul, and practice
        devotional worship; they inspire others to meet the Lord.  ||
        2 ||   True are their commands, and true are their empires; they
        are attuned to the Truth. True is their happiness, and true is
        their greatness. They know the Lord, to whom they belong.  ||
        3 ||   I wave the fan over them, carry water for them, and grind
        corn for the humble servants of the Lord. Nanak offers this prayer
        to God - please, grant me the sight of Your humble servants.
        || 4 || 7 || 54 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The True Guru is the
        Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God; He Himself is the Creator
        Lord. Your servant begs for the dust of Your feet. I am a sacrifice
        to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.  || 1 ||   O my Sovereign
        Lord, as You keep me, so do I remain. When it pleases You, I chant
        Your Name. You alone can grant me peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        Liberation, comfort and proper lifestyle come from serving You;
        You alone cause us to serve You. That place is heaven, where the
        Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung. You Yourself instill
        faith into us.  || 2 ||   Meditating, meditating, meditating in
        remembrance on the Naam, I live; my mind and body are enraptured.
        I wash Your Lotus Feet, and drink in this water, O my True Guru,
        O Merciful to the meek.  || 3 ||   I am a sacrifice to that most
        wonderful time when I came to Your Door. God has become compassionate
        to Nanak; I have found the Perfect True Guru.  || 4 || 8 || 55
        ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  When You come to mind, I am totally
        in bliss. One who forgets You might just as well be dead. That
        being, whom You bless with Your Mercy, O Creator Lord, constantly
        meditates on You.  || 1 ||   O my Lord and Master, You are the
        honor of the dishonored such as me. I offer my prayer to You,
        God; listening, listening to the Word of Your Bani, I live.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   May I become the dust of the feet of Your humble
        servants. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
        I enshrine Your Ambrosial Word within my heart. By Your Grace,
        I have found the Company of the Holy.  || 2 ||   I place the state
        of my inner being before You; there is no other as great as You.
        He alone is attached, whom You attach; he alone is Your devotee.
        || 3 ||   With my palms pressed together, I beg for this one
        gift; O my Lord and Master, if it pleases You, I shall obtain
        it. With each and every breath, Nanak adores You; twenty-four
        hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises.  || 4 || 9 || 56 ||
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  When You stand over our heads, O Lord
        and Master, how can we suffer in pain? The mortal being does not
        know how to chant Your Name - he is intoxicated with the
        wine of Maya, and the thought of death does not even enter his
        mind.  || 1 ||   O my Sovereign Lord, You belong to the Saints,
        and the Saints belong to You. <br>
