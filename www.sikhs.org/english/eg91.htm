      <p> Without the Shabad, all are attached to duality. Contemplate this
        in your heart, and see. O Nanak, blessed and very fortunate are
        those who keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts.  || 34
        ||   The Gurmukh obtains the jewel, lovingly focused on the Lord.
        The Gurmukh intuitively recognizes the value of this jewel. The
        Gurmukh practices Truth in action. The mind of the Gurmukh is
        pleased with the True Lord. The Gurmukh sees the unseen, when
        it pleases the Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukh does not have to endure
        punishment.  || 35 ||   The Gurmukh is blessed with the Name,
        charity and purification. The Gurmukh centers his meditation on
        the celestial Lord. The Gurmukh obtains honor in the Court of
        the Lord. The Gurmukh obtains the Supreme Lord, the Destroyer
        of fear. The Gurmukh does good deeds, an inspires others to do
        so. O Nanak, the Gurmukh unites in the Lord's Union.  ||
        36 ||   The Gurmukh understands the Simritees, the Shaastras and
        the Vedas. The Gurmukh knows the secrets of each and every heart.
        The Gurmukh eliminates hate and envy. The Gurmukh erases all accounting.
        The Gurmukh is imbued with love for the Lord's Name. O
        Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes his Lord and Master.  || 37 ||   Without
        the Guru, one wanders, coming and going in reincarnation. Without
        the Guru, one's work is useless. Without the Guru, the
        mind is totally unsteady. Without the Guru, one is unsatisfied,
        and eats poison. Without the Guru, one is stung by the poisonous
        snake of Maya, and dies. O Nanak without the Guru, all is lost.
        || 38 ||   One who meets the Guru is carried across. The residues
        of his sins and mistakes are erased, and he is emancipated through
        virtue. The supreme peace of liberation is attained, contemplating
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The Gurmukh is never defeated.
        In the store of the body, this mind is the merchant; O Nanak,
        it deals intuitively in Truth.  || 39 ||   The Gurmukh is the
        bridge, built by the Architect of Destiny. The demons of passion
        which plundered Sri Lanka - the body - have been
        conquered. Ram Chand - the mind - has slaughtered
        Raawan - pride; the Gurmukh understands the secret revealed
        by Babheekhan. The Gurmukh carries even stones across the ocean.
        The Gurmukh saves millions of people.  || 40 ||   The comings
        and goings in reincarnation are ended for the Gurmukh. The Gurmukh
        is honored in the Court of the Lord. The Gurmukh distinguishes
        the true from the false. The Gurmukh focuses his meditation on
        the celestial Lord. In the Court of the Lord, the Gurmukh is absorbed
        in His Praises. O Nanak, the Gurmukh is not bound by bonds.  ||
        41 ||   The Gurmukh obtains the Name of the Immaculate Lord. Through
        the Shabad, the Gurmukh burns away his ego. The Gurmukh sings
        the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. The Gurmukh remains absorbed
        in the True Lord. Through the True Name, the Gurmukh is honored
        and exalted. O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands all the worlds.
        || 42 ||   &quot;What is the root, the source of all? What
        teachings hold for these times? Who is your guru? Whose disciple
        are you? What is that speech, by which you remain unattached?
        Listen to what we say, O Nanak, you little boy. Give us your opinion
        on what we have said. <br>

      <p> How can the Shabad carry us across the terrifying world-ocean?&quot;
        || 43 ||   From the air came the beginning. This is the age of
        the True Guru's Teachings. The Shabad is the Guru, upon
        whom I lovingly focus my consciousness; I am the chaylaa, the
        disciple. Speaking the Unspoken Speech, I remain unattached. O
        Nanak, throughout the ages, the Lord of the World is my Guru.
        I contemplate the sermon of the Shabad, the Word of the One God.
        The Gurmukh puts out the fire of egotism.  || 44 ||   &quot;With
        teeth of wax, how can one chew iron? What is that food, which
        takes away pride? How can one live in the palace, the home of
        snow, wearing robes of fire? Where is that cave, within which
        one may remain unshaken? Who should we know to be pervading here
        and there? What is that meditation, which leads the mind to be
        absorbed in itself?&quot;  || 45 ||   Eradicating egotism and
        individualism from within, and erasing duality, the mortal becomes
        one with God. The world is difficult for the foolish, self-willed
        manmukh; practicing the Shabad, one chews iron. Know the One Lord,
        inside and out. O Nanak, the fire is quenched, through the Pleasure
        of the True Guru's Will.  || 46 ||   Imbued with the True
        Fear of God, pride is taken away; realize that He is One, and
        contemplate the Shabad. With the True Shabad abiding deep within
        the heart, the body and mind are cooled and soothed, and colored
        with the Lord's Love. The fire of sexual desire, anger
        and corruption is quenched. O Nanak, the Beloved bestows His Glance
        of Grace.  || 47 ||   &quot;The moon of the mind is cool and
        dark; how is it enlightened? How does the sun blaze so brilliantly?
        How can the constant watchful gaze of Death be turned away? By
        what understanding is the honor of the Gurmukh preserved? Who
        is the warrior, who conquers Death? Give us your thoughtful reply,
        O Nanak.&quot;  || 48 ||   Giving voice to the Shabad, the moon
        of the mind is illuminated with infinity. When the sun dwells
        in the house of the moon, the darkness is dispelled. Pleasure
        and pain are just the same, when one takes the Support of the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord. He Himself saves, and carries us across.
        With faith in the Guru, the mind merges in Truth, and then, prays
        Nanak, one is not consumed by Death.  || 49 ||   The essence of
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is known to be the most exalted
        and excellent of all. Without the Name, one is afflicted by pain
        and death. When one's essence merges into the essence,
        the mind is satisfied and fulfilled. Duality is gone, and one
        enters into the home of the One Lord. The breath blows across
        the sky of the Tenth Gate and vibrates. O Nanak, the mortal then
        intuitively meets the eternal, unchanging Lord.  || 50 ||   The
        absolute Lord is deep within; the absolute Lord is outside us
        as well. The absolute Lord totally fills the three worlds. One
        who knows the Lord in the fourth state, is not subject to virtue
        or vice. One who knows the mystery of God the Absolute, who pervades
        each and every heart, knows the Primal Being, the Immaculate Divine
        Lord. That humble being who is imbued with the Immaculate Naam,
        O Nanak, is himself the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny.
        || 51 ||   &quot;Everyone speaks of the Absolute Lord, the
        unmanifest void. How can one find this absolute void? Who are
        they, who are attuned to this absolute void?&quot; They are like
        the Lord, from whom they originated. They are not born, they do
        not die; they do not come and go. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs instruct
        their minds.  || 52 ||   By practicing control over the nine gates,
        one attains perfect control over the Tenth Gate. There, the unstruck
        sound current of the absolute Lord vibrates and resounds. Behold
        the True Lord ever-present, and merge with Him. <br>

      <p> The True Lord is pervading and permeating each and every heart.
        The hidden Bani of the Word is revealed. O Nanak, the True Lord
        is revealed and known.  || 53 ||   Meeting with the Lord through
        intuition and love, peace is found. The Gurmukh remains awake
        and aware; he does not fall sleep. He enshrines the unlimited,
        absolute Shabad deep within. Chanting the Shabad, he is liberated,
        and saves others as well. Those who practice the Guru's
        Teachings are attuned to the Truth. O Nanak, those who eradicate
        their self-conceit meet with the Lord; they do not remain separated
        by doubt.  || 54 ||   &quot;Where is that place, where evil
        thoughts are destroyed? The mortal does not understand the essence
        of reality; why must he suffer in pain?&quot; No one can save
        one who is tied up at Death's door. Without the Shabad,
        no one has any credit or honor. &quot;How can one obtain understanding
        and cross over?&quot; O Nanak, the foolish self-willed manmukh
        does not understand.  || 55 ||   Evil thoughts are erased, contemplating
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Meeting with the True Guru,
        the door of liberation is found. The self-willed manmukh does
        not understand the essence of reality, and is burnt to ashes.
        His evil-mindedness separates him from the Lord, and he suffers.
        Accepting the Hukam of the Lord's Command, he is blessed
        with all virtues and spiritual wisdom. O Nanak, he is honored
        in the Court of the Lord.  || 56 ||   One who possesses the merchandise,
        the wealth of the True Name, crosses over, and carries others
        across with him as well. One who intuitively understands, and
        is attuned to the Lord, is honored. No one can estimate his worth.
        Wherever I look, I see the Lord permeating and pervading. O Nanak,
        through the Love of the True Lord, one crosses over.  || 57 ||
        &quot;Where is the Shabad said to dwell? What will carry us
        across the terrifying world-ocean? The breath, when exhaled, extends
        out ten finger lengths; what is the support of the breath? Speaking
        and playing, how can one be stable and steady? How can the unseen
        be seen?&quot; Listen, O master; Nanak prays truly. Instruct
        your own mind. The Gurmukh is lovingly attuned to the True Shabad.
        Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He unites us in His Union. He Himself
        is all-knowing and all-seeing. By perfect destiny, we merge in
        Him.  || 58 ||   That Shabad dwells deep within the nucleus of
        all beings. God is invisible; wherever I look, there I see Him.
        The air is the dwelling place of the absolute Lord. He has no
        qualities; He has all qualities. When He bestows His Glance of
        Grace, the Shabad comes to abide within the heart, and doubt is
        eradicated from within. The body and mind become immaculate, through
        the Immaculate Word of His Bani. Let His Name be enshrined in
        your mind. The Shabad is the Guru, to carry you across the terrifying
        world-ocean. Know the One Lord alone, here and hereafter. He has
        no form or color, shadow or illusion; O Nanak, realize the Shabad.
        || 59 ||   O reclusive hermit, the True, Absolute Lord is the
        support of the exhaled breath, which extends out ten finger lengths.
        The Gurmukh speaks and churns the essence of reality, and realizes
        the unseen, infinite Lord. Eradicating the three qualities, he
        enshrines the Shabad within, and then, his mind is rid of egotism.
        Inside and out, he knows the One Lord alone; he is in love with
        the Name of the Lord. He understands the Sushmana, Ida and Pingala,
        when the unseen Lord reveals Himself. O Nanak, the True Lord is
        above these three energy channels. Through the Word, the Shabad
        of the True Guru, one merges with Him.  || 60 ||   &quot;The
        air is said to be the soul of the mind. But what does the air
        feed on? What is the way of the spiritual teacher, and the reclusive
        hermit? <br>

      </p>
      <p> What is the occupation of the Siddha?&quot; Without the Shabad,
        the essence does not come, O hermit, and the thirst of egotism
        does not depart. Imbued with the Shabad, one finds the ambrosial
        essence, and remains fulfilled with the True Name. &quot;What
        is that wisdom, by which one remains steady and stable? What food
        brings satisfaction?&quot;  O Nanak, when one looks upon pain
        and pleasure alike, through the True Guru, then he is not consumed
        by Death.  || 61 ||   If one is not imbued with the Lord's
        Love, nor intoxicated with His subtle essence, without the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, he is frustrated, and consumed by
        his own inner fire. He does not preserve his semen and seed, and
        does not chant the Shabad. He does not control his breath; he
        does not worship and adore the True Lord. But one who speaks the
        Unspoken Speech, and remains balanced, O Nanak, attains the Lord,
        the Supreme Soul.  || 62 ||   By Guru's Grace, one is attuned
        to the Lord's Love. Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, he
        is intoxicated with the Truth. Contemplating the Guru, the fire
        within is put out. Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, the soul
        settles in peace. Worshipping the True Lord in adoration, the
        Gurmukh crosses over the river of life. O Nanak, after deep contemplation,
        this is understood.  || 63 ||   &quot;Where does this mind-elephant
        live? Where does the breath reside? Where should the Shabad reside,
        so that the wanderings of the mind may cease?&quot; When the
        Lord blesses one with His Glance of Grace, he leads him to the
        True Guru. Then, this mind dwells in its own home within. When
        the individual consumes his egotism, he becomes immaculate, and
        his wandering mind is restrained. &quot;How can the root, the
        source of all be realized? How can the soul know itself? How can
        the sun enter into the house of the moon?&quot;  The Gurmukh
        eliminates egotism from within; then, O Nanak, the sun naturally
        enters into the home of the moon.  || 64 ||   When the mind becomes
        steady and stable, it abides in the heart, and then the Gurmukh
        realizes the root, the source of all. The breath is seated in
        the home of the navel; the Gurmukh searches, and finds the essence
        of reality. This Shabad permeates the nucleus of the self, deep
        within, in its own home; the Light of this Shabad pervades the
        three worlds. Hunger for the True Lord shall consume your pain,
        and through the True Lord, you shall be satisfied. The Gurmukh
        knows the unstruck sound current of the Bani; how rare are those
        who understand. Says Nanak, one who speaks the Truth is dyed in
        the color of Truth, which will never fade away.  || 65 ||   &quot;When
        this heart and body did not exist, where did the mind reside?
        When there was no support of the navel lotus, then in which home
        did the breath reside? When there was no form or shape, then how
        could anyone lovingly focus on the Shabad? When there was no dungeon
        formed from egg and sperm, who could measure the Lord's
        value and extent? When color, dress and form could not be seen,
        how could the True Lord be known?&quot; O Nanak, those who are
        attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are detached. Then
        and now, they see the Truest of the True.  || 66 ||   When the
        heart and the body did not exist, O hermit, then the mind resided
        in the absolute, detached Lord. When there was no support of the
        lotus of the navel, the breath remained in its own home, attuned
        to the Lord's Love. When there was no form or shape or
        social class, then the Shabad, in its essence, resided in the
        unmanifest Lord. <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> When the world and the sky did not even exist, the Light of the
        Formless Lord filled the three worlds. Color, dress and form were
        contained in the One Lord; the Shabad was contained in the One,
        Wondrous Lord. Without the True Name, no one can become pure;
        O Nanak, this is the Unspoken Speech.  || 67 ||   &quot;How,
        in what way, was the world formed, O man? And what disaster will
        end it?&quot; In egotism, the world was formed, O man; forgetting
        the Naam, it suffers and dies. One who becomes Gurmukh contemplates
        the essence of spiritual wisdom; through the Shabad, he burns
        away his egotism. His body and mind become immaculate, through
        the Immaculate Bani of the Word. He remains absorbed in Truth.
        Through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he remains detached; he
        enshrines the True Name in his heart. O Nanak, without the Name,
        Yoga is never attained; reflect upon this in your heart, and see.
        || 68 ||   The Gurmukh is one who reflects upon the True Word
        of the Shabad. The True Bani is revealed to the Gurmukh. The mind
        of the Gurmukh is drenched with the Lord's Love, but how
        rare are those who understand this. The Gurmukh dwells in the
        home of the self, deep within. The Gurmukh realizes the Way of
        Yoga. O Nanak, the Gurmukh knows the One Lord alone.  || 69 ||
        Without serving the True Guru, Yoga is not attained; without
        meeting the True Guru, no one is liberated. Without meeting the
        True Guru, the Naam cannot be found. Without meeting the True
        Guru, one suffers in terrible pain. Without meeting the True Guru,
        there is only the deep darkness of egotistical pride. O Nanak,
        without the True Guru, one dies, having lost the opportunity of
        this life.  || 70 ||   The Gurmukh conquers his mind by subduing
        his ego. The Gurmukh enshrines Truth in his heart. The Gurmukh
        conquers the world; he knocks down the Messenger of Death, and
        kills it. The Gurmukh does not lose in the Court of the Lord.
        The Gurmukh is united in God's Union; he alone knows. O
        Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Word of the Shabad.  || 71 ||
        This is the essence of the Shabad - listen, you hermits
        and Yogis. Without the Name, there is no Yoga. Those who are attuned
        to the Name, remain intoxicated night and day; through the Name,
        they find peace. Through the Name, everything is revealed; through
        the Name, understanding is obtained. Without the Name, people
        wear all sorts of religious robes; the True Lord Himself has confused
        them. The Name is obtained only from the True Guru, O hermit,
        and then, the Way of Yoga is found. Reflect upon this in your
        mind, and see; O Nanak, without the Name, there is no liberation.
        || 72 ||   You alone know Your state and extent, Lord; What can
        anyone say about it? You Yourself are hidden, and You Yourself
        are revealed. You Yourself enjoy all pleasures. The seekers, the
        Siddhas, the many gurus and disciples wander around searching
        for You, according to Your Will. They beg for Your Name, and You
        bless them with this charity. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed
        Vision of Your Darshan. The eternal imperishable Lord God has
        staged this play; the Gurmukh understands it. O Nanak, He extends
        Himself throughout the ages; there is no other than Him.  || 73

          VAAR OF RAAMKALEE,  THIRD MEHL,
        </center>
      </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          TO BE SUNG TO THE TUNE OF  'JODHA AND VEERA POORBAANEE':
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> <font color="#000000">SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The True Guru is the
        field of intuitive wisdom. One who is inspired to love Him, plants
        the seed of the Name there. The Name sprouts up, and he remains
        absorbed in the Name. But this egotism is the seed of skepticism;
        it has been uprooted. It is not planted there, and it does not
        sprout; whatever God grants us, we eat. When water mixes with
        water, it cannot be separated again. O Nanak, the Gurmukh is wonderful;
        come, poeple, and see! But what can the poor people see? They
        do not understand. He alone sees, whom the Lord causes to see;
        the Lord comes to dwell in his mind.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The
        self-willed manmukh is the field of sorrow and suffering. He plains
        sorrow, and eats sorrow. In sorrow he is born, and in sorrow he
        dies. Acting in egotism, his life passes away. He does not understand
        the coming and going of reincarnation; the blind man acts in blindness.
        He does not know the One who gives, but he is attached to what
        is given. O Nanak, he acts according to his pre-ordained destiny.
        He cannot do anything else.  || 2 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Meeting the
        True Guru, everlasting peace is obtained. He Himself leads us
        to meet Him. This is the true meaning of peace, that one becomes
        immaculate within oneself. The doubt of ignorance is eradicated,
        and spiritual wisdom is obtained. Nanak comes to gaze upon the
        One Lord alone; wherever he looks, there He is.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:
        The True Lord created His throne, upon which He sits. He Himself
        is everything; this is what the Word of the Guru's Shabad
        says. Through His almighty creative power, He created and fashioned
        the mansions and hotels. He made the two lamps, the sun and the
        moon; He formed the perfect form. He Himself sees, and He Himself
        hears; meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 1
        ||   Waaho! Waaho! Hail, hail, O True King! True is Your Name.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   SHALOK:  Kabeer, I have ground myself into
        henna paste. O my Husband Lord, You took no notice of me; You
        never applied me to Your feet.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak,
        my Husband Lord keeps me like henna paste; He blesses me with
        His Glance of Grace. He Himself grinds me, and He Himself rubs
        me; He Himself applies me to His feet. This is the cup of love
        of my Lord and Master; He gives it as He chooses.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        You created the world with its variety; by the Hukam of Your
        Command, it comes, goes, and merges again in You. You Yourself
        see, and blossom forth; there is no one else at all. As it pleases
        You, You keep me. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        I understand You. You are the strength of all. As it pleases You,
        You lead us on. There is no other as great as You; unto whom should
        I speak and talk?  || 2 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Deluded by
        doubt, I wandered over the whole world. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Searching, I became frustrated. My Husband Lord has not blessed
        me with peace and tranquility; what will work with Him? By Guru's
        Grace, I meditate on the Lord; I enshrine Him deep within my heart.
        O Nanak, seated in his her own home, she finds her Husband Lord,
        when the Creator Lord grants His Grace.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        Chasing after worldly affairs, the day is wasted, and the night
        passes in sleep. Speaking lies, one eats poison; the self-willed
        manmukh departs, crying out in pain. The Mesenger of Death holds
        his club over the mortal's head; in the love of duality,
        he loses his honor. He never even thinks of the Name of the Lord;
        over and over again, he comes and goes in reincarnation. But if,
        by Guru's Grace, the Lord's Name comes to dwell
        in his mind, then the Messenger of Death will not strike him down
        with his club. Then, O Nanak, he merges intuitively into the Lord,
        receiving His Grace.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Some are linked to His
        Praises, when the Lord blesses them with the Guru's Teachings.
        Some are blessed with the Name of the eternal, unchanging True
        Lord. Water, air and fire, by His Will, worship Him. They are
        held in the Fear of God; He has formed the perfect form. The Hukam,
        the Command of the One Lord is all-pervasive; accepting it, peace
        is found.  || 3 ||   SHALOK:  Kabeer, such is the touchstone of
        the Lord; the false cannot even touch it. He alone passes this
        test of the Lord, who remains dead while yet alive.  || 1 || 
        THIRD MEHL:  How can this mind be conquered? How can it be killed?
        If one does not accept the Word of the Shabad, egotism does not
        depart. By Guru's Grace, egotism is eradicated, and then,
        one is Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive. O Nanak,
        one whom the Lord forgives is united with Him, and then no obstacles
        block his way.  || 2 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Everyone can say that they
        are dead while yet alive; how can they be liberated while yet
        alive? If someone restrains himself through the Fear of God, and
        takes the medicine of the Love of God, night and day, he sings
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. In celestial peace and poise,
        he crosses over the poisonous, terrifying world-ocean, through
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the
        Lord; he is blessed with His Glance of Grace.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:
        God created the love of duality, and the three modes which pervade
        the universe. He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, who act according
        to His Will. The Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers
        study their books, but they do not understand contemplation. Everything
        is Your play, O True Creator Lord. As it pleases You, You bless
        us with forgiveness, and merge us in the True Word of the Shabad.
        || 4 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The man of false mind practices
        falsehood. He runs after Maya, and yet pretends to be a man of
        disciplined meditation. Deluded by doubt, he visits all the sacred
        shrines of pilgrimage. How can such a man of disciplined meditation
        attain the supreme status? By Guru's Grace, one lives the
        Truth. O Nanak, such a man of disciplined meditation attains liberation.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  He alone is a man of disciplined meditation,
        who practices this self-discipline. Meeting with the True Guru,
        he contemplates the Word of the Shabad. Serving the True Guru
        - this is the only acceptable disciplined meditation. O
        Nanak, such a man of disciplined meditation is honored in the
        Court of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He created the night and
        the day, for the activities of the world. <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Following the Guru's Teachings, one's heart is illumined,
        and the darkness is dispelled. By the Hukam of His Command, He
        creates everything; He pervades and permeates all the woods and
        meadows. He Himself is everything; the Gurmukh constantly chants
        the Lord's Name. Through the Shabad, understanding comes;
        the True Lord Himself inspires us to understand.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  He is not called a renunciate, whose consciousness
        is filled with doubt. Donations to him bring proportionate rewards.
        He hungers for the supreme status of the Fearless, Immaculate
        Lord; O Nanak, how rare are those who offer him this food.  ||
        1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  They are not called renunciates, who take
        food in the homes of others. For the sake of their bellies, they
        wear various religious robes. They alone are renunciates, O Nanak,
        who enter into their own souls. They seek and find their Husband
        Lord; they dwell within the home of their own inner self.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  They sky and the earth are separate, but the True
        Lord supports them from within. True are all those homes and gates,
        within which the True Name is enshrined. The Hukam of the True
        Lord's Command is effective everywhere. The Gurmukh merges
        in the True Lord. He Himself is True, and True is His throne.
        Seated upon it, He administers true justice. The Truest of the
        True is all-pervading everywhere; the Gurmukh sees the unseen.
        || 6 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  In the world-ocean, the Infinite
        Lord abides. The false come and go in reincarnation. One who walks
        according to his own will, suffers terrible punishment. All things
        are in the world-ocean, but they are obtained only by the karma
        of good actions. O Nanak, he alone obtains the nine treasures,
        who walks in the Will of the Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  One
        who intuitively serves the True Guru, loses his life in egotism.
        His tongue does not taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and
        his heart-lotus does not blossom forth. The self-willed manmukh
        eats poison and dies; he is ruined by love and attachment to Maya.
        Without the Name of the One Lord, his life is cursed, and his
        home is cursed as well. When God Himself bestows His Glance of
        Grace, then one becomes the slave of His slaves. And then, night
        and day, he serves the True Guru, and never leaves His side. As
        the lotus flower floats unaffected in the water, so does he remain
        detached in his own household. O servant Nanak, the Lord acts,
        and inspires everyone to act, according to the Pleasure of His
        Will. He is the treasure of virtue.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  For thirty-six
        ages, there was utter darkness. Then, the Lord revealed Himself.
        He Himself created the entire universe. He Himself blessed it
        with understanding. He created the Simritees and the Shaastras;
        He calculates the accounts of virtue and vice. He alone understands,
        whom the Lord inspires to understand and to be pleased with the
        True Word of the Shabad. He Himself is all-pervading; He Himself
        forgives, and unites with Himself.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:
        This body is all blood; without blood, the body cannot exist.
        Those who are attuned to their Lord - their bodies are
        not filled with the blood of greed. <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> In the Fear of God, the body becomes thin, and the blood of greed
        passes out of the body. As fire purifies metal, so does the Fear
        of the Lord eradicate the filth of evil-mindedness. O Nanak, beautiful
        are those humble beings, who are imbued with the Lord's
        Love.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  In Raamkalee, I have enshrined the
        Lord in my mind; thus I have been embellished. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, my heart-lotus has blossomed forth;
        the Lord blessed me with the treasure of devotional worship. My
        doubt was dispelled, and I woke up; the darkness of ignorance
        was dispelled. She who is in love with her Lord, is the most infinitely
        beautiful. Such a beautiful, happy soul-bride enjoys her Husband
        Lord forever. The self-willed manmukhs do not know how to decorate
        themselves; wasting their whole lives, they depart. Those who
        decorate themselves without devotional worship to the Lord, are
        continually reincarnated to suffer. They do not obtain respect
        in this world; the Creator Lord alone knows what will happen to
        them in the world hereafter. O Nanak, the True Lord is the One
        and only; duality exists only in the world. He Himself enjoins
        them to good and bad; they do only that which the Creator Lord
        causes them to do.  || 2 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Without serving the
        True Guru, tranquility is not obtained. It cannot be found anywhere
        else. No matter how much one may long for it, without the karma
        of good actions, it cannot be found. Those whose inner beings
        are filled with greed and corruption, are ruined through the love
        of duality. The cycle of birth and death is not ended, and filled
        with egotism, they suffer in pain. Those who focus their consciousness
        on the True Guru, do not remain unfulfilled. They are not summoned
        by the Messenger of Death, and they do not suffer in pain. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukh is saved, merging in the True Word of the Shabad.
        || 3 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself remains unattached forever; all
        others run after worldly affairs. He Himself is eternal, unchanging
        and unmoving; the others continue coming and going in reincarnation.
        Meditating on the Lord forever and ever, the Gurmukh finds peace.
        He dwells in the home of his own inner being, absorbed in the
        Praise of the True Lord. The True Lord is profound and unfathomable;
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is understood.
        || 8 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Meditate on the True Name; the
        True Lord is all-pervading. O Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam
        of the Lord's Command, obtains the fruit of Truth. One
        who merely mouths the words, does not understand the Hukam of
        the True Lord's Command. O Nanak, one who accepts the Will
        of the Lord is His devotee. Without accepting it, he is the falsest
        of the false.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukhs
        do not know what they are saying. They are filled with sexual
        desire, anger and egotism. They do not understand right places
        and wrong places; they are filled with greed and corruption. They
        come, and sit and talk for their own purposes. The Messenger of
        Death strikes them down. Hereafter, they are called to account
        in the Court of the Lord; the false ones are struck down and humiliated.
        How can this filth of falsehood be washed off? Can anyone think
        about this, and find the way? If one meets with the True Guru,
        He implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord within; all residues
        of his sinful mistakes are destroyed. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Let all bow in humility to that humble being who chants the Naam,
        and worships the Naam in adoration. The Naam washes off the filth
        of falsehood; chanting the Naam, one becomes truthful. O servant
        Nanak, wondrous are the plays of the Lord, the Giver of life.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You are the Great Giver; no other is as great
        as You. Unto whom should I speak and talk? By Guru's Grace,
        I find You; You eradicate egotism from within. You are beyond
        sweet and salty flavors; True is Your glorious greatness. You
        bless those whom You forgive, and unite them with Yourself. You
        have placed the Ambrosial Nectar deep within the heart; the Gurmukh
        drinks it in.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The stories of
        one's ancestors make the children good children. They accept
        what is pleasing to the Will of the True Guru, and act accordingly.
        Go and consult the Simritees, the Shaastras, the writings of Vyaas,
        Suk Dayv, Naarad, and all those who preach to the world. Those,
        whom the True Lord attaches, are attached to the Truth; they contemplate
        the True Name forever. O Nanak, their coming into the world is
        approved; they redeem all their ancestors.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        The disciples whose teacher is blind, act blindly as well. They
        walk according to their own wills, and continually speak falsehood
        and lies. They practice falsehood and deception, and endlessly
        slander others. Slandering others, they drown themselves, and
        drown all their generations as well. O Nanak, whatever the Lord
        links them to, to that they are linked; what can the poor creatures
        do?  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He keeps all under His Gaze; He created
        the entire Universe. He has linked some to falsehood and deception;
        these self-willed manmukhs are plundered. The Gurmukhs meditate
        on the Lord forever; their inner beings are filled with love.
        Those who have the treasure of virtue, chant the Praises of the
        Lord. O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, and the Glorious Praises
        of the True Lord.  || 10 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Men of charity
        gather wealth by committing sins, and then give it away in donations
        to charity. Their spiritual teachers go to their homes to instruct
        them. The woman loves the man only for his wealth; they come and
        go as they please. No one obeys the Shaastras or the Vedas. Everyone
        worships himself. Becoming judges, they sit and administer justice.
        They chant on their malas, and call upon God. They accept bribes,
        and block justice. If someone asks them, they read quotations
        from their books. The Muslim scriptures are in their ears and
        in their hearts. They plunder the people, and engage in gossip
        and flattery. They anoint their kitchens to try to become pure.
        Behold, such is the Hindu. The Yogi, with matted hair and ashes
        on his body, has become a householder. The children weep in front
        of him and behind him. He does not attain Yoga - he has
        lost his way. Why does he apply ashes to his forehead? O Nanak,
        this is the sign of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga; everyone says that
        he himself knows.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The Hindu comes to the
        house of a Hindu. He puts the sacred thread around his neck and
        reads the scriptures. He puts on the thread, but does evil deeds.
        His cleansings and washings will not be approved. <br>

      </p>
      <p> The Muslim glorifies his own faith. Without the Guru or a spiritual
        teacher, no one is accepted. They may be shown the way, but only
        a few go there. Without the karma of good actions, heaven is not
        attained. The Way of Yoga is demonstrated in the Yogi's
        monastery. They wear ear-rings to show the way. Wearing ear-rings,
        they wander around the world. The Creator Lord is everywhere.
        There are as many travellers as there are beings. When one's
        death warrant is issued, there is no delay. One who knows the
        Lord here, realizes Him there as well. Others, whether Hindu or
        Muslim, are just babbling. Everyone's account is read in
        the Court of the Lord; without the karma of good actions, no one
        crosses over. One who speaks the True Name of the True Lord, O
        Nanak, is not called to account hereafter.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        The fortress of the body is called the Mansion of the Lord. The
        rubies and gems are found within it; the Gurmukh chants the Name
        of the Lord. The body, the Mansion of the Lord, is very beautiful,
        when the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is implanted deep within.
        The self-willed manmukhs ruin themselves; they boil continuously
        in attachment to Maya. The One Lord is the Master of all. He is
        found only by perfect destiny.  || 11 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        There is no Truth in suffering, there is no Truth in comfort.
        There is no Truth in wandering like animals through the water.
        There is no Truth in shaving one's head; there is no Truth
        is studying the scriptures or wandering in foreign lands. There
        is no Truth in trees, plants or stones, in mutilating oneself
        or suffering in pain. There is no Truth in binding elephants in
        chains; there is no Truth in grazing cows. He alone grants it,
        whose hands hold spritual perfection; he alone receives it, unto
        whom it is given. O Nanak, he alone is blessed with glorious greatness,
        whose heart is filled with the Word of the Shabad. God says, all
        hearts are mine, and I am in all hearts. Who can explain this
        to one who is confused? Who can confuse that being, unto whom
        I have shown the Way? And who can show the Path to that being
        whom I have confused since the beginning of time?  || 1 ||   FIRST
        MEHL:  He alone is a householder, who restrains his passions and
        begs for meditation, austerity and self-discipline. He gives donations
        to charity with his body; such a householder is as pure as the
        water of the Ganges. Says Eeshar, the Lord is the embodiment of
        Truth. The supreme essence of reality has no shape or form.  ||
        2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  He alone is a detached hermit, who burns away
        his self-conceit. He begs for suffering as his food. In the city
        of the heart, he begs for charity. Such a renunciate ascends to
        the City of God. Says Gorakh, God is the embodiment of Truth;
        the supreme essence of reality has no shape or form.  || 3 ||
        FIRST MEHL:  He alone is an Udasi, a shaven-headed renunciate,
        who embraces renunciation. He sees the Immaculate Lord dwelling
        in both the upper and lower regions. He balances the sun and the
        moon energies. The body-wall of such an Udasi does not collapse.
        Says Gopi Chand, God is the embodiment of Truth; the supreme essence
        of reality has no shape or form.  || 4 ||   FIRST MEHL:  He alone
        is a Paakhandi, who cleanses his body of filth. The fire of his
        body illuminates God within. He does not waste his energy in wet
        dreams. </p>
