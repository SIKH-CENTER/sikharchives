      <p> The Name of the Lord is pleasing to my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Naarada the sage, and Shaarada the goddess of knowledge,
        serve the Lord. The goddess Lakhshmi sits by Him as His slave.
        || 2 ||   The mala is around my neck, and the Lord's Name
        is upon my tongue. I repeat the Naam, the Name of the Lord, a
        thousand times, and bow in reverence to Him.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer,
        I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; I teach both Hindus and
        Muslims.  || 4 || 4 || 13 || </p>

        AASAA,  KABEER JEE,  9 PANCH-PADAS,  5 DU-TUKAS:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> You tear off the leaves, O gardener, but in each and every leaf,
        there is life. That stone idol, for which you tear off those leaves
        -  that stone idol is lifeless.  || 1 ||   In this, you are
        mistaken, O gardener. The True Guru is the Living Lord.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Brahma is in the leaves, Vishnu is in the branches,
        and Shiva is in the flowers. When you break these three gods,
        whose service are you performing?  || 2 ||   The sculptor carves
        the stone and fashions it into an idol, placing his feet upon
        its chest. If this stone god was true, it would devour the sculptor
        for this!  || 3 ||   Rice and beans, candies, cakes and cookies
        -  the priest enjoys these, while he puts ashes into the mouth
        of the idol.  || 4 ||   The gardener is mistaken, and the world
        is mistaken, but I am not mistaken. Says Kabeer, the Lord preserves
        me; the Lord, my King, has showered His Blessings upon me.  ||
        5 || 1 || 14 ||   AASAA:  Twelve years pass in childhood, and
        for another twenty years, he does not practice self-discipline
        and austerity. For another thirty years, he does not worship God
        in any way, and then, when he is old, he repents and regrets.
        || 1 ||   His life wastes away as he cries out, &quot;Mine, mine!&quot;
        The pool of his power has dried up.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He makes
        a dam around the dried-up pool, and with his hands, he makes a
        fence around the harvested field. When the thief of Death comes,
        he quickly carries away what the fool had tried to preserve as
        his own.  || 2 ||   His feet and head and hands begin to tremble,
        and the tears flow copiously from his eyes. His tongue has not
        spoken the correct words, but now, he hopes to practice religion!
        || 3 ||   If the Dear Lord shows His Mercy, one enshrines love
        for Him, and obtains the Profit of the Lord's Name. By Guru's
        Grace, he receives the wealth of the Lord's Name, which alone
        shall go with him, when he departs in the end.  || 4 ||   Says
        Kabeer, listen, O Saints  -  he shall not take any other wealth
        with him. When the summons comes from the King, the Lord of the
        Universe, the mortal departs, leaving behind his wealth and mansions.
        || 5 || 2 || 15 ||   AASAA:  To some, the Lord has given silks
        and satins, and to some, beds decorated with cotton ribbons. Some
        do not even have a poor patched coat, and some live in thatched
        huts.  || 1 ||   Do not indulge in envy and bickering, O my mind.
        By continually doing good deeds, these are obtained, O my mind.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The potter works the same clay, and colors
        the pots in different ways. Into some, he sets pearls, while to
        others, he attaches filth.  || 2 || </p>

      <p> God gave wealth to the miser for him to preserve, but the fool
        calls it his own. When the Messenger of Death strikes him with
        his club, in an instant, everything is settled.  || 3 ||   The
        Lord's humble servant is called the most exalted Saint; he
        obeys the Command of the Lord's Order, and obtains peace.
        Whatever is pleasing to the Lord, he accepts as True; he enshrines
        the Lord's Will within his mind.  || 4 ||   Says Kabeer,
        listen, O Saints  -  it is false to call out, &quot;Mine, mine.&quot;
        Breaking the bird cage, death takes the bird away, and only the
        torn threads remain.  || 5 || 3 || 16 ||   AASAA:  I am Your humble
        servant, Lord; Your Praises are pleasing to my mind. The Lord,
        the Primal Being, the Master of the poor, does not ordain that
        they should be oppressed.  || 1 ||   O Qazi, it is not right to
        speak before Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Keeping your fasts, reciting
        your prayers, and reading the Kalma, the Islamic creed, shall
        not take you to paradise. The Temple of Mecca is hidden within
        your mind, if you only knew it.  || 2 ||   That should be your
        prayer, to administer justice. Let your Kalma be the knowledge
        of the unknowable Lord. Spread your prayer mat by conquering your
        five desires, and you shall recognize the true religion.  || 3
        ||   Recognize Your Lord and Master, and fear Him within your
        heart; conquer your egotism, and make it worthless. As you see
        yourself, see others as well; only then will you become a partner
        in heaven.  || 4 ||   The clay is one, but it has taken many forms;
        I recognize the One Lord within them all. Says Kabeer, I have
        abandoned paradise, and reconciled my mind to hell.  || 5 || 4
        || 17 ||   AASAA:  From the city of the Tenth Gate, the sky of
        the mind, not even a drop rains down. Where is the music of the
        sound current of the Naad, which was contained in it? The Supreme
        Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, the Master of wealth has taken
        away the Supreme Soul.  || 1 ||   O Father, tell me: where has
        it gone? It used to dwell within the body, and dance in the mind,
        teaching and speaking.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Where has the player
        gone  -  he who made this temple his own? No story, word or
        understanding is produced; the Lord has drained off all the power.
        || 2 ||   The ears, your companions, have gone deaf, and the
        power of your organs is exhausted. Your feet have failed, your
        hands have gone limp, and no words issue forth from your mouth.
        || 3 ||   Having grown weary, the five enemies and all the thieves
        have wandered away according to their own will. The elephant of
        the mind has grown weary, and the heart has grown weary as well;
        through its power, it used to pull the strings.  || 4 ||   He
        is dead, and the bonds of the ten gates are opened; he has left
        all his friends and brothers. Says Kabeer, one who meditates on
        the Lord, breaks his bonds, even while yet alive.  || 5 || 5 ||
        18 ||   AASAA,  4 IK-TUKAS:  No one is more powerful than the
        she-serpent Maya, who deceived even Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
        || 1 ||   Having bitten and struck them down, she now sits in
        the immaculate waters. By Guru's Grace, I have seen her,
        who has bitten the three worlds.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Siblings
        of Destiny, why is she called a she-serpent? One who realizes
        the True Lord, devours the she-serpent.  || 2 ||   No one else
        is more frivolous than this she-serpent. When the she-serpent
        is overcome, what can the Messengers of the King of Death do? </p>
      <p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> || 3 ||   This she-serpent is created by Him. What power or weakness
        does she have by herself?   || 4 ||   If she abides with the mortal,
        then his soul abides in his body. By Guru's Grace, Kabeer
        has easily crossed over.  || 5 || 6 || 19 ||   AASAA:  Why bother
        to read the Simritees to a dog? Why bother to sing the Lord's
        Praises to the faithless cynic?  || 1 ||   Remain absorbed in
        the Lord's Name, Raam, Raam, Raam. Do not bother to speak
        of it to the faithless cynic, even by mistake.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Why offer camphor to a crow? Why give the snake milk to
        drink?  || 2 ||   Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
        discriminating understanding is attained. That iron which touches
        the Philosopher's Stone becomes gold.  || 3 ||   The dog,
        the faithless cynic, does everything as the Lord causes him to
        do. He does the deeds pre-ordained from the very beginning.  ||
        4 ||   If you take Ambrosial Nectar and irrigate the neem tree
        with it, still, its natural qualities are not changed.  || 5 ||
        7 || 20 ||   AASAA:  A fortress like that of Sri Lanka, with the
        ocean as a moat around it  -  there is no news about that house
        of Raavan.  || 1 ||   What shall I ask for? Nothing is permanent.
        I see with my eyes that the world is passing away.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Thousands of sons and thousands of grandsons  -  but
        in that house of Raavan, the lamps and wicks have gone out.  ||
        2 ||   The moon and the sun cooked his food. The fire washed his
        clothes.  || 3 ||   Under Guru's Instructions, one whose
        mind is filled with the Lord's Name, becomes permanent, and
        does not go anywhere.  || 4 ||   Says Kabeer, listen, people:
        without the Lord's Name, no one is liberated.  || 5 || 8
        || 21 ||   AASAA:  First, the son was born, and then, his mother.
        The guru falls at the feet of the disciple.  || 1 ||   Listen
        to this wonderful thing, O Siblings of Destiny! I saw the lion
        herding the cows.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The fish of the water
        gives birth upon a tree. I saw a cat carrying away a dog.  ||
        2 ||   The branches are below, and the roots are above. The trunk
        of that tree bears fruits and flowers.  || 3 ||   Riding a horse,
        the buffalo takes him out to graze. The bull is away, while his
        load has come home.  || 4 ||   Says Kabeer, one who understands
        this hymn, and chants the Lord's Name, comes to understand
        everything.  || 5 || 9 || 22 || </p>

        22 CHAU-PADAS AND PANCH-PADAS,  AASAA OF KABEER JEE,
        <p> 8 TRI-PADAS,  7 DU-TUKAS,  1 IK-TUKA: </p>
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The Lord created the body from sperm, and protected it in the
        fire pit. For nine months He preserved you in your mother's
        womb, and then, after you were born, you became attached to Maya.
        || 1 ||   O mortal, why have you attached yourself to greed,
        and lost the jewel of life? You did not plant the seeds of good
        actions in the earth of your past lives.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        From an infant, you have grown old. That which was to happen,
        has happened. When the Messenger of Death comes and grabs you
        by your hair, why do you cry out then? </p>
      <p>
        <center>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> || 2 ||   You hope for long life, while Death counts your breaths.
        The world is a game, O Kabeer, so throw the dice consciously.
        || 3 || 1 || 23 ||   AASAA:  I make my body the dying vat, and
        within it, I dye my mind. I make the five elements my marriage
        guests. I take my marriage vows with the Lord, my King; my soul
        is imbued with His Love.  || 1 ||   Sing, sing, O brides of the
        Lord, the marriage songs of the Lord. The Lord, my King, has come
        to my house as my Husband.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Within the lotus
        of my heart, I have made my bridal pavilion, and I have spoken
        the wisdom of God. I have obtained the Lord King as my Husband
        -  such is my great good fortune.  || 2 ||   The angles, holy
        men, silent sages, and the 330,000,000 deities have come in their
        heavenly chariots to see this spectacle. Says Kabeer, I have been
        taken in marriage by the One Supreme Being, the Lord God.  ||
        3 || 2 || 24 ||   AASAA:  I am bothered by my mother-in-law, Maya,
        and loved by my father-in-law, the Lord. I fear even the name
        of my husband's elder brother, Death. O my mates and companions,
        my husband's sister, misunderstanding has seized me, and
        I am burning with the pain of separation from my husband's
        younger brother, divine knowledge.  || 1 ||   My mind has gone
        insane, since I forgot the Lord. How can I lead a virtuous lifestyle?
        He rests in the bed of my mind, but I cannot see Him with my eyes.
        Unto whom should I tell my sufferings?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My
        step-father, egotism, fights with me, and my mother, desire, is
        always intoxicated. When I stayed with my elder brother, meditation,
        then I was loved by my Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   Says Kabeer, the
        five passions argue with me, and in these arguments, my life is
        wasting away. The false Maya has bound the whole world, but I
        have obtained peace, chanting the Name of the Lord.  || 3 || 3
        || 25 ||   AASAA:  In my house, I constantly weave the thread,
        while you wear the thread around your neck, O Brahmin. You read
        the Vedas and sacred hymns, while I have enshrined the Lord of
        the Universe in my heart.  || 1 ||   Upon my tongue, within my
        eyes, and within my heart, abides the Lord, the Lord of the Universe.
        When you are interrogated at Death's door, O mad-man, what
        will you say then?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am a cow, and You are
        the herdsman, the Sustainer of the World. You are my Saving Grace,
        lifetime after lifetime. You have never taken me across to graze
        there  -  what sort of a herdsman are You?  || 2 ||   You are
        a Brahmin, and I am a weaver of Benares; can You understand my
        wisdom? You beg from emperors and kings, while I meditate on the
        Lord.  || 3 || 4 || 26 ||   AASAA:  The life of the world is only
        a dream; life is just a dream. Believing it to be true, I grasped
        at it, and abandoned the supreme treasure.  || 1 ||   O Father,
        I have enshrined love and affection for Maya, which has taken
        the jewel of spiritual wisdom away from me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The moth sees with its eyes, but it still becomes entangled;
        the insect does not see the fire. Attached to gold and woman,
        the fool does not think of the noose of Death.  || 2 ||   Reflect
        upon this, and abandon sin; the Lord is a boat to carry you across.
        Says Kabeer, such is the Lord, the Life of the World; there is
        no one equal to Him.  || 3 || 5 || 27 ||   AASAA: </p>

      <p> In the past, I have taken many forms, but I shall not take form
        again. The strings and wires of the musical instrument are worn
        out, and I am in the power of the Lord's Name.  || 1 || 
        Now, I no longer dance to the tune. My mind no longer beats the
        drum.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have burnt away sexual desire, anger
        and attachment to Maya, and the pitcher of my desires has burst.
        The gown of sensuous pleasures is worn out, and all my doubts
        have been dispelled.  || 2 ||   I look upon all beings alike,
        and my conflict and strife are ended. Says Kabeer, when the Lord
        showed His Favor, I obtained Him, the Perfect One.  || 3 || 6
        || 28 ||   AASAA:  You keep your fasts to please Allah, while
        you murder other beings for pleasure. You look after your own
        interests, and so not see the interests of others. What good is
        your word?  || 1 ||   O Qazi, the One Lord is within you, but
        you do not behold Him by thought or contemplation. You do not
        care for others, you are a religious fanatic, and your life is
        of no account at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your holy scriptures
        say that Allah is True, and that he is neither male nor female.
        But you gain nothing by reading and studying, O mad-man, if you
        do not gain the understanding in your heart.  || 2 ||   Allah
        is hidden in every heart; reflect upon this in your mind. The
        One Lord is within both Hindu and Muslim; Kabeer proclaims this
        out loud.  || 3 || 7 || 29 ||   AASAA,  TI-PADA,  IK-TUKA:  I
        have decorated myself to meet my Husband Lord. But the Lord, the
        Life of the Word, the Sustainer of the Universe, has not come
        to meet me.  || 1 ||   The Lord is my Husband, and I am the Lord's
        bride. The Lord is so great, and I am infinitesimally small. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The bride and the Groom dwell together. They
        lie upon the one bed, but their union is difficult.  || 2 || 
        Blessed is the soul-bride, who is pleasing to her Husband Lord.
        Says Kabeer, she shall not have to be reincarnated again.  ||

      <p> When the Diamond of the Lord pierces the diamond of my mind, the
        fickle mind waving in the wind is easily absorbed into Him. This
        Diamond fills all with Divine Light; through the True Guru's
        Teachings, I have found Him.  || 1 ||   The sermon of the Lord
        is the unstruck, endless song. Becoming a swan, one recognizes
        the Diamond of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Says Kabeer, I
        have seen such a Diamond, permeating and pervading the world.
        The hidden diamond became visible, when the Guru revealed it to
        me.  || 2 || 1 || 31 ||   AASAA:  My first wife, ignorance, was
        ugly, of low social status and bad character; she was evil in
        my home, and in her parents' home. My present bride, divine
        understanding, is beautiful, wise and well-behaved; I have taken
        her to my heart.  || 1 ||   It has turned out so well, that my
        first wife has died. May she, whom I have now married, live throughout
        the ages.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Says Kabeer, when the younger
        bride came, the elder one lost her husband. The younger bride
        is with me now, and the elder one has taken another husband. </p>

      <p> || 2 || 2 || 32 ||   AASAA:  My daughter-in-law was first called
        Dhannia, the woman of wealth, but now she is called Raam-jannia,
        the servant of the Lord.  || 1 ||   These shaven-headed saints
        have ruined my house. They have caused my son to start chanting
        the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Says Kabeer, listen,
        O mother: these shaven-headed saints have done away with my low
        social status.  || 2 || 3 || 33 ||   AASAA:  Stay, stay, O daughter-in-law
        -  do not cover your face with a veil. In the end, this shall
        not bring you even half a shell.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The one
        before you used to veil her face; do not follow in her footsteps.
        || 1 ||   The only merit in veiling your face is that for a few
        days, people will say, &quot;What a noble bride has come&quot;.
        || 2 ||   Your veil shall be true only if you skip, dance and
        sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer,
        the soul-bride shall win, only if she passes her life singing
        the Lord's Praises.  || 4 || 1 || 34 ||   AASAA:  I would
        rather be cut apart by a saw, than have You turn Your back on
        me. Hug me close, and listen to my prayer.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice
        to You  -  please, turn Your face to me, O Beloved Lord. Why
        have You turned Your back to me? Why have You killed me?  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Even if You cut my body apart, I shall not pull
        my limbs away from You. Even if my body falls, I shall not break
        my bonds of love with You.  || 2 ||   Between You and I, there
        is no other. You are the Husband Lord, and I am the soul-bride.
        || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, listen, O people: now, I place no reliance
        in you.  || 4 || 2 || 35 ||   AASAA:  No one knows the secret
        of God, the Cosmic Weaver. He has stretched out the fabric of
        the whole world.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When you listen to the
        Vedas and the Puraanas, you shall know that the whole world is
        only a small piece of His woven fabric.  || 1 ||   He has made
        the earth and sky His loom. Upon it, He moves the two bobbins
        of the sun and the moon.  || 2 ||   Placing my feet together,
        I have accomplished one thing  -  my mind is pleased with that
        Weaver. I have come to understand my own home, and recognize the
        Lord within my heart.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, when my body workshop
        breaks, the Weaver shall blend my thread with His thread.  ||
        4 || 3 || 36 ||   AASAA:  With filth within the heart, even if
        one bathes at sacred places of pilgrimage, still, he shall not
        go to heaven. Nothing is gained by trying to please others  - 
        the Lord cannot be fooled.  || 1 ||   Worship the One Divine Lord.
        The true cleansing bath is service to the Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   If salvation can be obtained by bathing in water, then what
        about the frog, which is always bathing in water? As is the frog,
        so is that mortal; he is reincarnated, over and over again.  ||
        2 ||   If the hard-hearted sinner dies in Benaares, he cannot
        escape hell. And even if the Lord's Saint dies in the cursed
        land of Haramba, still, he saves all his family.  || 3 ||   Where
        there is neither day nor night, and neither Vedas nor Shaastras,
        there, the Formless Lord abides. Says Kabeer, meditate on Him,
        O mad-men of the world.  || 4 || 4 || 37 || </p>

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> AASAA,  THE WORD OF THE REVEREND NAAM DAYV JEE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> In the one and in the many, He is pervading and permeating; wherever
        I look, there He is. The marvellous image of Maya is so fascinating;
        how few understand this.  || 1 ||   God is everything, God is
        everything. Without God, there is nothing at all. As one thread
        holds hundreds and thousands of beads, He is woven into His creation.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The waves of the water, the foam and bubbles,
        are not distinct from the water. This manifested world is the
        playful game of the Supreme Lord God; reflecting upon it, we find
        that it is not different from Him.  || 2 ||   False doubts and
        dream objects  -  man believes them to be true. The Guru has
        instructed me to try to do good deeds, and my awakened mind has
        accepted this.  || 3 ||   Says Naam Dayv, see the Creation of
        the Lord, and reflect upon it in your heart. In each and every
        heart, and deep within the very nucleus of all, is the One Lord.
        || 4 || 1 ||   AASAA:  Bringing the pitcher, I fill it with water,
        to bathe the Lord. But 4.2 million species of beings are in the
        water  -  how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny?
        || 1 ||   Wherever I go, the Lord is there. He continually plays
        in supreme bliss.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I bring flowers to weave
        a garland, in worshipful adoration of the Lord. But the bumble
        bee has already sucked out the fragrance  -  how can I use
        it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny?  || 2 ||   I carry milk
        and cook it to make pudding, with which to feed the Lord. But
        the calf has already tasted the milk  -  how can I use it for
        the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny?  || 3 ||   The Lord is here,
        the Lord is there; without the Lord, there is no world at all.
        Prays Naam Dayv, O Lord, You are totally permeating and pervading
        all places and interspaces.  || 4 || 2 ||   AASAA:  My mind is
        the yardstick, and my tongue is the scissors. I measure it out
        and cut off the noose of death.  || 1 ||   What do I have to do
        with social status? What do I have to with ancestry? I meditate
        on the Name of the Lord, day and night.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        I dye myself in the color of the Lord, and sew what has to be
        sewn. Without the Lord's Name, I cannot live, even for a
        moment.  || 2 ||   I perform devotional worship, and sing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord. Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate
        on my Lord and Master.  || 3 ||   My needle is gold, and my thread
        is silver. Naam Dayv's mind is attached to the Lord.  ||
        4 || 3 ||   AASAA:  The snake sheds its skin, but does not lose
        its venom. The heron appears to be meditating, but it is concentrating
        on the water.  || 1 ||   Why do you practice meditation and chanting,
        when your mind is not pure?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That man who
        feeds like a lion, is called the god of thieves.  || 2 || </p>

      <p> Naam Dayv's Lord and Master has settled my inner conflicts.
        Drink in the sublime elixir of the Lord, O deceitful one.  ||
        3 || 4 ||   AASAA:  One who recognizes the Supreme Lord God, dislikes
        other desires. He focuses his consciousness on the Lord's
        devotional worship, and keeps his mind free of anxiety.  || 1
        ||   O my mind, how will you cross over the world-ocean, if you
        are filled with the water of corruption? Gazing upon the falseness
        of Maya, you have gone astray, O my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        You have given me birth in the house of a calico-printer, but
        I have found the Teachings of the Guru. By the Grace of the Saint,
        Naam Dayv has met the Lord.  || 2 || 5 || </p>

        AASAA,  THE WORD OF THE REVEREND RAVI DAAS JEE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The deer, the fish, the bumble bee, the moth and the elephant
        are destroyed, each for a single defect. So the one who is filled
        with the five incurable vices  -  what hope is there for him?
        || 1 ||   O Lord, he is in love with ignorance. His lamp of clear
        wisdom has grown dim.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The creeping creatures
        live thoughtless lives, and cannot discriminate between good and
        evil. It is so difficult to obtain this human incarnation, and
        yet, they keep company with the low.  || 2 ||   Wherever the beings
        and creatures are, they are born according to the karma of their
        past actions. The noose of death is unforgiving, and it shall
        catch them; it cannot be warded off.  || 3 ||   O servant Ravi
        Daas, dispel your sorrow and doubt, and know that Guru-given spiritual
        wisdom is the penance of penances. O Lord, Destroyer of the fears
        of Your humble devotees, make me supremely blissful in the end.
        || 4 || 1 ||   AASAA:  Your Saints are Your body, and their company
        is Your breath of life. By the True Guru-given spiritual wisdom,
        I know the Saints as the gods of gods.  || 1 ||   O Lord, God
        of gods, grant me the Society of the Saints, the sublime essence
        of the Saints' conversation, and the Love of the Saints.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Character of the Saints, the lifestyle
        of the Saints, and the service of the servant of the Saints. 
        || 2 ||   I ask for these, and for one thing more  -  devotional
        worship, which shall fulfill my desires. Do not show me the wicked
        sinners.  || 3 ||   Says Ravi Daas, he alone is wise, who knows
        this: there is no difference between the Saints and the Infinite
        Lord.  || 4 || 2 ||   AASAA:  You are sandalwood, and I am the
        poor castor oil plant, dwelling close to you. From a lowly tree,
        I have become exalted; Your fragrance, Your exquisite fragrance
        now permeates me.  || 1 ||   O Lord, I seek the Sanctuary of the
        company of Your Saints; I am worthless, and You are so benevolent.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are the white and yellow threads of
        silk, and I am like a poor worm. O Lord, I seek to live in the
        Company of the Saints, like the bee with its honey.  || 2 || 
        My social status is low, my ancestry is low, and my birth is
        low as well. I have not performed the service of the Lord, the
        Lord, says Ravi Daas the cobbler.  || 3 || 3 ||   AASAA:  What
        would it matter, if my body were cut into pieces? If I were to
        lose Your Love, Lord, then Your humble servant would be afraid.
        || 1 ||   Your lotus feet are the home of my mind. Drinking in
        Your Nectar, I have obtained the wealth of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        Pause  || </p>

      </p>
      <p> Prosperity, adversity, property and wealth are just Maya. Your
        humble servant is not engrossed in them.  || 2 ||   Your humble
        servant is tied by the rope of Your Love. Says Ravi Daas, what
        benefit would I get by escaping from it?  || 3 || 4 ||   AASAA:
        The Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Haray. Meditating on
        the Lord, the humble are carried across to salvation.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Through the Lord's Name, Kabeer became famous
        and respected. The accounts of his past incarnations were torn
        up.  || 1 ||   Because of Naam Dayv's devotion, the Lord
        drank the milk he offered. He shall not have to suffer the pains
        of reincarnation into the world again.  || 2 ||   Servant Ravi
        Daas is imbued with the Lord's Love. By Guru's Grace,
        he shall not have to go to hell.  || 3 || 5 ||   AASAA:  How does
        the puppet of clay dance? He looks and listens, hears and speaks,
        and runs around.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When he acquires something,
        he is inflated with ego. But when his wealth is gone, then he
        cries and bewails.  || 1 ||   In thought, word and deed, he is
        attached to the sweet and tangy flavors. When he dies, no one
        knows where he has gone.  || 2 ||   Says Ravi Daas, the world
        is just a dramatic play, O Siblings of Destiny. I have enshrined
        love for the Lord, the star of the show.  || 3 || 6 || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        AASAA,  THE WORD OF DEVOTEE DHANNA JEE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> I wandered through countless incarnations, but mind, body and
        wealth never remain stable. Attached to, and stained by the poisons
        of sexual desire and greed, the mind has forgotten the jewel of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The poisonous fruit seems sweet
        to the demented mind, which does not know the difference between
        good and evil. Turning away from virtue, his love for other things
        increases, and he weaves again the web of birth and death.  ||
        1 ||   He does not know the way to the Lord, who dwells within
        his heart; burning in the trap, he is caught by the noose of death.
        Gathering the poisonous fruits, he fills his mind with them, and
        he forgets God, the Supreme Being, from his mind.  || 2 ||   The
        Guru has given the wealth of spiritual wisdom; practicing meditation,
        the mind becomes one with Him. Embracing loving devotional worship
        for the Lord, I have come to know peace; satisfied and satiated,
        I have been liberated.  || 3 ||   One who is filled with the Divine
        Light, recognizes the undeceivable Lord God. Dhanna has obtained
        the Lord, the Sustainer of the World, as his wealth; meeting the
        humble Saints, he merges in the Lord.  || 4 || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        Naam Dayv's mind was absorbed into God, Gobind, Gobind,
        Gobind. The calico-printer, worth half a shell, became worth millions.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Abandoning weaving and stretching thread,
        Kabeer enshrined love for the Lord's lotus feet. A weaver
        from a lowly family, he became an ocean of excellence.  || 1 ||
        Ravi Daas, who used to carry dead cows every day, renounced
        the world of Maya. He became famous in the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, and obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan.  || 2 ||   Sain, the barber, the village drudge, became
        famous in each and every house. </p>

      </p>
      <p> The Supreme Lord God dwelled in his heart, and he was counted
        among the devotees.  || 3 ||   Hearing this, Dhanna the Jaat applied
        himself to devotional worship. The Lord of the Universe met him
        personally; Dhanna was so very blessed.  || 4 || 2 ||   O my consciousness,
        why don't you remain conscious of the Merciful Lord? How
        can you recognize any other? You may run around the whole universe,
        but that alone happens which the Creator Lord does.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   In the water of the mother's womb, He fashioned
        the body with ten gates. He gives it sustenance, and preserves
        it in fire  -  such is my Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   The mother
        turtle is in the water, and her babies are out of the water. She
        has no wings to protect them, and no mik to feed them. The Perfect
        Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss, the Fascinating Lord takes
        care of them. See this, and understand it in your mind  || 2 ||
        The worm lies hidden under the stone  -  there is no way
        for him to escape. Says Dhanna, the Perfect Lord takes care of
        him. Fear not, O my soul.  || 3 || 3 || </p>

        AASAA,  THE WORD OF SHAYKH FAREED JEE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> They alone are true, whose love for God is deep and heart-felt.
        Those who have one thing in their heart, and something else in
        their mouth, are judged to be false.  || 1 ||   Those who are
        imbued with love for the Lord, are delighted by His Vision. Those
        who forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are a burden on the
        earth.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those whom the Lord attaches to the
        hem of His robe, are the true dervishes at His Door. Blessed are
        the mothers who gave birth to them, and fruitful is their coming
        into the world.  || 2 ||   O Lord, Sustainer and Cherisher, You
        are infinite, unfathomable and endless. Those who recognize the
        True Lord  -  I kiss their feet.  || 3 ||   I seek Your Protection
        -  You are the Forgiving Lord. Please, bless Shaykh Fareed
        with the bounty of Your meditative worship.  || 4 || 1 ||   AASAA:
        Says Shaykh Fareed, O my dear friend, attach yourself to the
        Lord. This body shall turn to dust, and its home shall be a neglected
        graveyard.  || 1 ||   You can meet the Lord today, O Shaykh Fareed,
        if you restrain your bird-like desires which keep your mind in
        turmoil.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If I had known that I was to die,
        and not return again, I would not have ruined myself by clinging
        to the world of falsehood.  || 2 ||   So speak the Truth, in righteousness,
        and do not speak falsehood. The disciple ought to travel the route,
        pointed out by the Guru.  || 3 ||   Seeing the youths being carried
        across, the hearts of the beautiful young soul-brides are encouraged.
        Those who side with the glitter of gold, are cut down with a saw.
        || 4 ||   O Shaykh, no one's life is permanent in this world.
        That seat, upon which we now sit  -  many others sat on it
        and have since departed.  || 5 ||   As the swallows appear in
        the month of Katik, forest fires in the month of Chayt, and lightning
        in Saawan, and as the bride's arms adorn her husband's
        neck in winter;  || 6 ||   Just so, the transitory human bodies
        pass away. Reflect upon this in your mind. It takes six months
        to form the body, but it breaks in an instant.  || 7 ||   O Fareed,
        the earth asks the sky, &quot;Where have the boatmen gone?&quot;
        Some have been cremated, and some lie in their graves; their souls
        are suffering rebukes.  || 8 || 2 || <br>
