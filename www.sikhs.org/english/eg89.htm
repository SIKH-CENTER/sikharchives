      <p> Renouncing selfishness and conceit, he remains always on the side
        of the Guru; he does not know anyone except the Guru. Says Nanak,
        listen, O Saints: such a Sikh turns toward the Guru with sincere
        faith, and becomes sunmukh.  || 21 ||   One who turns away from
        the Guru, and becomes baymukh - without the True Guru,
        he shall not find liberation. He shall not find liberation anywhere
        else either; go and ask the wise ones about this. He shall wander
        through countless incarnations; without the True Guru, he shall
        not find liberation. But liberation is attained, when one is attached
        to the feet of the True Guru, chanting the Word of the Shabad.
        Says Nanak, contemplate this and see, that without the True Guru,
        there is no liberation.  || 22 ||   Come, O beloved Sikhs of the
        True Guru, and sing the True Word of His Bani. Sing the Guru's
        Bani, the supreme Word of Words. Those who are blessed by the
        Lord's Glance of Grace - their hearts are imbued
        with this Bani. Drink in this Ambrosial Nectar, and remain in
        the Lord's Love forever; meditate on the Lord, the Sustainer
        of the world. Says Nanak, sing this True Bani forever.  || 23
        ||   Without the True Guru, other songs are false. The songs are
        false without the True Guru; all other songs are false. The speakers
        are false, and the listeners are false; those who speak and recite
        are false. They may continually chant, 'Har, Har'
        with their tongues, but they do not know what they are saying.
        Their consciousness is lured by Maya; they are just reciting mechanically.
        Says Nanak, without the True Guru, other songs are false.  ||
        24 ||   The Word of the Guru's Shabad is a jewel, studded
        with diamonds. The mind which is attached to this jewel, merges
        into the Shabad. One whose mind is attuned to the Shabad, enshrines
        love for the True Lord. He Himself is the diamond, and He Himself
        is the jewel; one who is blessed, understands its value. Says
        Nanak, the Shabad is a jewel, studded with diamonds.  || 25 ||
        He Himself created Shiva and Shakti, mind and matter; the Creator
        subjects them to His Command. Enforcing His Order, He Himself
        sees all. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, come to know Him.
        They break their bonds, and attain liberation; they enshrine the
        Shabad within their minds. Those whom the Lord Himself makes Gurmukh,
        lovingly focus their consciousness on the One Lord. Says Nanak,
        He Himself is the Creator; He Himself reveals the Hukam of His
        Command.  || 26 ||   The Simritees and the Shaastras discriminate
        between good and evil, but they do not know the true essence of
        reality. They do not know the true essence of reality without
        the Guru; they do not know the true essence of reality. The world
        is asleep in the three modes and doubt; it passes the night of
        its life sleeping. Those humble beings remain awake and aware,
        within whose minds, by Guru's Grace, the Lord abides; they
        chant the Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani. Says Nanak,
        they alone obtain the essence of reality, who night and day remain
        lovingly absorbed in the Lord; they pass the night of their life
        awake and aware.  || 27 ||   He nourished us in the mother's
        womb; why forget Him from the mind? Why forget from the mind such
        a Great Giver, who gave us sustenance in the fire of the womb?
        Nothing can harm one, whom the Lord inspires to embrace His Love. <br>

      </p>
      <p> He Himself is the love, and He Himself is the embrace; the Gurmukh
        contemplates Him forever. Says Nanak, why forget such a Great
        Giver from the mind?  || 28 ||   As is the fire within the womb,
        so is Maya outside. The fire of Maya is one and the same; the
        Creator has staged this play. According to His Will, the child
        is born, and the family is very pleased. Love for the Lord wears
        off, and the child becomes attached to desires; the script of
        Maya runs its course. This is Maya, by which the Lord is forgotten;
        emotional attachment and love of duality well up. Says Nanak,
        by Guru's Grace, those who enshrine love for the Lord find
        Him, in the midst of Maya.  || 29 ||   The Lord Himself is priceless;
        His worth cannot be estimated. His worth cannot be estimated,
        even though people have grown weary of trying. If you meet such
        a True Guru, offer your head to Him; your selfishness and conceit
        will be eradicated from within. Your soul belongs to Him; remain
        united with Him, and the Lord will come to dwell in your mind.
        The Lord Himself is priceless; very fortunate are those, O Nanak,
        who attain to the Lord.  || 30 ||   The Lord is my capital; my
        mind is the merchant. The Lord is my capital, and my mind is the
        merchant; through the True Guru, I know my capital. Meditate continually
        on the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul, and you shall collect your profits
        daily. This wealth is obtained by those who are pleasing to the
        Lord's Will. Says Nanak, the Lord is my capital, and my
        mind is the merchant.  || 31 ||   O my tongue, you are engrossed
        in other tastes, but your thirsty desire is not quenched. Your
        thirst shall not be quenched by any means, until you attain the
        subtle essence of the Lord. If you do obtain the subtle essence
        of the Lord, and drink in this essence of the Lord, you shall
        not be troubled by desire again. This subtle essence of the Lord
        is obtained by good karma, when one comes to meet with the True
        Guru. Says Nanak, all other tastes and essences are forgotten,
        when the Lord comes to dwell within the mind.  || 32 ||   O my
        body, the Lord infused His Light into you, and then you came into
        the world. The Lord infused His Light into you, and then you came
        into the world. The Lord Himself is your mother, and He Himself
        is your father; He created the created beings, and revealed the
        world to them. By Guru's Grace, some understand, and then
        it's a show; it seems like just a show. Says Nanak, He
        laid the foundation of the Universe, and infused His Light, and
        then you came into the world.  || 33 ||   My mind has become joyful,
        hearing of God's coming. Sing the songs of joy to welcome
        the Lord, O my companions; my household has become the Lord's
        Mansion. Sing continually the songs of joy to welcome the Lord,
        O my companions, and sorrow and suffering will not afflict you.
        Blessed is that day, when I am attached to the Guru's feet
        and meditate on my Husband Lord. I have come to know the unstruck
        sound current and the Word of the Guru's Shabad; I enjoy
        the sublime essence of the Lord, the Lord's Name. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Says Nanak, God Himself has met me; He is the Doer, the Cause
        of causes.  || 34 ||   O my body, why have you come into this
        world? What actions have you committed? And what actions have
        you committed, O my body, since you came into this world? The
        Lord who formed your form - you have not enshrined that
        Lord in your mind. By Guru's Grace, the Lord abides within
        the mind, and one's pre-ordained destiny is fulfilled.
        Says Nanak, this body is adorned and honored, when one's
        consciousness is focused on the True Guru.  || 35 ||   O my eyes,
        the Lord has infused His Light into you; do not look upon any
        other than the Lord. Do not look upon any other than the Lord;
        the Lord alone is worthy of beholding. This whole world which
        you see is the image of the Lord; only the image of the Lord is
        seen. By Guru's Grace, I understand, and I see only the
        One Lord; there is no one except the Lord. Says Nanak, these eyes
        were blind; but meeting the True Guru, they became all-seeing.
        || 36 ||   O my ears, you were created only to hear the Truth.
        To hear the Truth, you were created and attached to the body;
        listen to the True Bani. Hearing it, the mind and body are rejuvenated,
        and the tongue is absorbed in Ambrosial Nectar. The True Lord
        is unseen and wondrous; His state cannot be described. Says Nanak,
        listen to the Ambrosial Naam and become holy; you were created
        only to hear the Truth.  || 37 ||   The Lord placed the soul to
        the cave of the body, and blew the breath of life into the musical
        instrument of the body. He blew the breath of life into the musical
        instrument of the body, and revealed the nine doors; but He kept
        the Tenth Door hidden. Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's
        Gate, some are blessed with loving faith, and the Tenth Door is
        revealed to them. There are many images of the Lord, and the nine
        treasures of the Naam; His limits cannot be found. Says Nanak,
        the Lord placed the soul to the cave of the body, and blew the
        breath of life into the musical instrument of the body.  || 38
        ||   Sing this true song of praise in the true home of your soul.
        Sing the song of praise in your true home; meditate there on the
        True Lord forever. They alone meditate on You, O True Lord, who
        are pleasing to Your Will; as Gurmukh, they understand. This Truth
        is the Lord and Master of all; whoever is blessed, obtains it.
        Says Nanak, sing the true song of praise in the true home of your
        soul.  || 39 ||   Listen to the song of bliss, O most fortunate
        ones; all your longings shall be fulfilled. I have obtained the
        Supreme Lord God, and all sorrows have been forgotten. Pain, illness
        and suffering have departed, listening to the True Bani. The Saints
        and their friends are in ecstasy, knowing the Perfect Guru. Pure
        are the listeners, and pure are the speakers; the True Guru is
        all-pervading and permeating. Prays Nanak, touching the Guru's
        Feet, the unstruck sound current of the celestial bugles vibrates
        and resounds.  || 40 || 1 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">He is the Great Giver of the Universe, the
        Lover of His devotees, throughout the three worlds. One who is
        merged in the Word of the Guru's Shabad does not know any
        other. Dwelling upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he
        does not know any other; he meditates on the One Name of the Lord.
        By the Grace of Guru Nanak and Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das obtained
        the supreme status. And when the call came for Him to depart,
        He merged in the Name of the Lord. Through devotional worship
        in this world, the imperishable, immovable, immeasurable Lord
        is found.  || 1 ||   The Guru gladly accepted the Lord's
        Will, and so the Guru easily reached the Lord God's Presence.
        The True Guru prays to the Lord, &quot;Please, save my honor.
        This is my prayer&quot;. Please save the honor of Your humble
        servant, O Lord; please bless him with Your Immaculate Name. At
        this time of final departure, it is our only help and support;
        it destroys death, and the Messenger of Death. The Lord God heard
        the prayer of the True Guru, and granted His request. The Lord
        showered His Mercy, and blended the True Guru with Himself; He
        said, &quot;Blessed! Blessed! Wonderful!&quot;  || 2 ||   Listen
        O my Sikhs, my children and Siblings of Destiny; it is my Lord's
        Will that I must now go to Him. The Guru gladly accepted the Lord's
        Will, and my Lord God applauded Him. One who is pleased with the
        Lord God's Will is a devotee, the True Guru, the Primal
        Lord. The unstruck sound current of bliss resounds and vibrates;
        the Lord hugs him close in His embrace. O my children, siblings
        and family, look carefully in your minds, and see. The pre-ordained
        death warrant cannot be avoided; the Guru is going to be with
        the Lord God.  || 3 ||   The True Guru, in His Own Sweet Will,
        sat up and summoned His family. Let no one weep for me after I
        am gone. That would not please me at all. When a friend receives
        a robe of honor, then his friends are pleased with his honor.
        Consider this and see, O my children and siblings; the Lord has
        given the True Guru the robe of supreme honor. The True Guru Himself
        sat up, and appointed the successor to the Throne of Raja Yoga,
        the Yoga of Meditation and Success. All the Sikhs, relatives,
        children and siblings have fallen at the Feet of Guru Ram Das.
        || 4 ||   Finally, the True Guru said, &quot;When I am gone,
        sing Kirtan in Praise of the Lord, in Nirvaanaa.&quot; Call in
        the long-haired scholarly Saints of the Lord, to read the sermon
        of the Lord, Har, Har. Read the sermon of the Lord, and listen
        to the Lord's Name; the Guru is pleased with love for the
        Lord. Do not bother with offering rice-balls on leaves, lighting
        lamps, and other rituals like floating the body out on the Ganges;
        instead, let my remains be given up to the Lord's Pool.
        The Lord was pleased as the True Guru spoke; he was blended then
        with the all-knowing Primal Lord God. <br>

      </p>
      <p> The Guru then blessed the Sodhi Ram Das with the ceremonial tilak
        mark, the insignia of the True Word of the Shabad.  || 5 ||  
        And as the True Guru, the Primal Lord spoke, and the Gursikhs
        obeyed His Will. His son Mohri turned sunmukh, and become obedient
        to Him; he bowed, and touched Ram Das' feet. Then, everyone
        bowed and touched the feet of Ram Das, into whom the Guru infused
        His essence. And any that did not bow then because of envy -
        later, the True Guru brought them around to bow in humility. It
        pleased the Guru, the Lord, to bestow glorious greatness upon
        Him; such was the pre-ordained destiny of the Lord's Will.
        Says Sundar, listen, O Saints: all the world fell at His feet.

        seen Him, sleeping upon the bed within each and every heart; my
        Beloved is the sweetest ambrosial nectar. He is with all, but
        he cannot be found; the fool does not know His taste. Intoxicated
        with the wine of Maya, the mortal babbles on about trivial affairs;
        giving in to the illusion, he cannot meet the Lord. Says Nanak,
        without the Guru, he cannot understand the Lord, the Friend who
        is standing near everyone.  || 1 ||   God, my God - the
        Support of the breath of life is my God. Merciful Lord, my Merciful
        Lord - the Giver of gifts is my Merciful Lord. The Giver
        of gifts is infinite and unlimited; deep within each and every
        heart, He is so beautiful! He created Maya, His slave, so powerfully
        pervasive - she has enticed all beings and creatures. One
        whom the Lord saves, chants the True Name, and contemplates the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad. Says Nanak, one who is pleasing
        to God - God is very dear to him.  || 2 ||   I take pride,
        I take pride in God; I take pride in my God. Wise, God is wise;
        my Lord and Master is all-wise, and all-knowing. All-wise and
        all-knowing, and forever supreme; the Name of the Lord is Ambrosial
        Nectar. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny recorded upon
        their foreheads, taste it, and are satisfied with the Lord of
        the Universe. They meditate on Him, and find Him; they place all
        their pride in Him. Says Nanak, He is seated on His eternal throne;
        True is His royal court.  || 3 ||   The song of joy, the Lord's
        song of joy; listen to the song of joy of my God. The wedding
        song, God's wedding song; the unstruck sound current of
        His wedding song resounds. The unstruck sound current vibrates,
        and the Word of the Shabad resounds; there is continuous, continual
        rejoicing. Meditating on that God, everything is obtained; He
        does not die, or come or go. Thirst is quenched, and hopes are
        fulfilled; the Gurmukh meets with the absolute, unmanifest Lord.
        Says Nanak, in the Home of my God, the songs of joy are continuously,
        continually heard. <br>

        Destroyer of sin; He eradicates the unbearable pains of the terrifying
        world-ocean. Contemplate the Lord of the World, the Cherisher
        of the World, the Lord, the Virtuous Lord of the Universe. Prays
        Nanak, joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, remember
        the Lord, day and night.  || 1 ||   His lotus feet are the support
        and anchor of His humble servants. He takes the Naam, the Name
        of the Infinite Lord, as his wealth, property and treasure. Those
        who have the treasure of the Lord's Name, enjoy the taste
        of the One Lord. They meditate on the Infinite Lord with each
        and every breath, as their pleasure, joy and beauty. The Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, is the Destroyer of sins, the only deed
        of redemption. The Naam drives out the fear of the Messenger of
        Death. Prays Nanak, the support of His lotus feet is the capital
        of His humble servant.  || 2 ||   Your Glorious Virtues are endless,
        O my Lord and Master; no one knows them all. Seeing and hearing
        of Your wondrous plays, O Merciful Lord, Your devotees narrate
        them. All beings and creatures meditate on You, O Primal Transcendent
        Lord, Master of men. All beings are beggars; You are the One Giver,
        O Lord of the Universe, Embodiment of mercy. He alone is holy,
        a Saint, a truly wise person, who is accepted by the Dear Lord.
        Prays Nanak, they alone realize You, unto whom You show Mercy.
        || 3 ||   I am unworthy and without any master; I seek Your Sanctuary,
        Lord. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Divine
        Guru, who has implanted the Naam within me. The Guru blessed me
        with the Naam; happiness came, and all my desires were fulfilled.
        The fire of desire has been quenched, and peace and tranquility
        have come; after such a long separation, I have met my Lord again.
        I have found ecstasy, pleasure and true intuitive poise, singing
        the great glories, the song of bliss of the Lord. Prays Nanak,
        I have obtained the Name of God from the Perfect Guru.  || 4 ||
        2 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Rise early each morning, and with
        the Saints, sing the melodious harmony, the unstruck sound current
        of the Shabad. All sins and sufferings are erased, chanting the
        Lord's Name, under Guru's Instructions. Dwell upon
        the Lord's Name, and drink in the Nectar; day and night,
        worship and adore Him. The merits of Yoga, charity and religious
        rituals are obtained by grasping His lotus feet. Loving devotion
        to the merciful, enticing Lord takes away all pain. Prays Nanak,
        cross over the world-ocean, meditating on the Lord, your Lord
        and Master.  || 1 ||   Meditation on the Lord of the Universe
        is an ocean of peace; Your devotees sing Your Glorious Praises,
        Lord. Ecstasy, bliss and great happiness are obtained by grasping
        hold of the Guru's feet. Meeting with the treasure of peace,
        their pains are taken away; granting His Grace, God protects them.
        Those who grasp the Lord's feet - their fears and
        doubts run away, and they chant the Name of the Lord. <br>

        upon the One Lord alone. Prays Nanak, God has granted His Grace,
        and I have found the Perfect True Guru.  || 2 ||   Meet with the
        holy, humble servants of God; meeting with the Lord, listen to
        the Kirtan of His Praises. God is the Merciful Master, the Lord
        of wealth; there is no end to His Virtues. The Merciful Lord is
        the Dispeller of pain, the Giver of Sanctuary, the Eradicator
        of all evil. Emotional attachment, sorrow, corruption and pain
        - chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is saved
        from these. All beings are Yours, O my God; bless me with Your
        Mercy, that I may become the dust under the feet of all men. Prays
        Nanak, O God, be kind to me, that I may chant Your Name, and live.
        || 3 ||   God saves His humble devotees, attaching them to His
        feet. Twenty-four hours a day, they meditate in remembrance on
        their God; they meditae on the One Name. Meditating on that God,
        they cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and their comings
        and goings cease. They enjoy eternal peace and pleasure, singing
        the Kirtan of God's Praises; His Will seems so sweet to
        them. All my desires are fulfilled, meeting with the Perfect True
        Guru. Prays Nanak, God has blended me with Himself; I shall never
        suffer pain or sorrow again.  || 4 || 3 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH
        MEHL,  CHHANT.  SHALOK:  In the Sanctuary of His lotus feet, I
        sing His Glorious Praises in ecstasy and bliss. O Nanak, worship
        God in adoration, the Eradicator of misfortune.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:
        God is the Eradicator of misfortune; there is none other than
        Him. Forever and ever, remember the Lord in meditation; He is
        permeating the water, the land and the sky. He is permeating and
        pervading the water, the land and the sky; do not forget Him from
        your mind, even for an instant. Blessed was that day, when I grasped
        the Guru's feet; all virtues rest in the Lord of the Universe.
        So serve Him day and night, O servant; whatever pleases Him, happens.
        Nanak is a sacrifice to the Giver of peace; his mind and body
        are enlightened.  || 1 ||   SHALOK:  Meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord, the mind and body find peace; the thought of duality
        is dispelled. Nanak takes the support of the Lord of the World,
        the Lord of the Universe, the Destroyer of troubles.  || 1 ||
        CHHANT:  The Merciful Lord has eradicated my fears and troubles.
        In ecstasy, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; God is the
        Cherisher, the Master of the meek. The Cherishing Lord is imperishable,
        the One and only Primal Lord; I am imbued with His Love. When
        I placed my hands and forehead upon His Feet, He blended me with
        Himself; I became awake and aware forever, night and day. My soul,
        body, household and home belong to Him, along with my body, youth,
        wealth and property. Forever and ever, Nanak is a sacrifice to
        Him, who cherishes and nurtures all beings.  || 2 ||   SHALOK:
        My tongue chants the Name of the Lord, and chants the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Nanak has grasped the sheltering
        support of the One Transcendent Lord, who shall save him in the
        end.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  He is God, our Lord and Master, our Saving
        Grace. Grab hold of the hem of His robe. <br>

      <p> Vibrate, and meditate on the Merciful Divine Lord in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy; renounce your intellectual mind.
        Seek the Support of the One Lord, and surrender your soul to Him;
        place your hopes only in the Sustainer of the World. Those who
        are imbued with the Lord's Name, in the Saadh Sangat, cross
        over the terrifying world-ocean. The corrupting sins of birth
        and death are eradicated, and no stain ever sticks to them again.
        Nanak is a sacrifice to the Perfect Primal Lord; His marriage
        is eternal.  || 3 ||   SHALOK:  Righteous faith, wealth, sexual
        success and salvation; the Lord bestows these four blessings.
        One who has such pre-ordained destiny upon his forehead, O Nanak,
        has all his desires fulfilled.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  All my desires
        are fulfilled, meeting with my Immaculate, Sovereign Lord. I am
        in ecstasy, O very fortunate ones; the Dear Lord has become manifest
        in my own home. My Beloved has come to my home, because of my
        past actions; how can I count His Glories? The Lord, the Giver
        of peace and intuition, is infinite and perfect; with what tongue
        can I describe His Glorious Virtues? He hugs me close in His embrace,
        and merges me into Himself; there is no place of rest other than
        Him. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the Creator, who is contained
        in, and permeating all.  || 4 || 4 ||   RAAG RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH

        Lord, which inspires us to take the Support of the Name.  || 1

        and breath have blossomed forth. The eternal, unchanging Lord

        His Virtues are priceless. By great good fortune, I have found
        Him; my pain is dispelled, and my hopes are fulfilled. Prays Nanak,
        I have entered Your Sanctuary, Lord, and my fear of death is eradicated.
        || 2 ||   SHALOK:  Without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, one dies wandering around in confusion, performing all sorts
        of rituals. O Nanak, all are bound by the attractive bonds of
        Maya, and the karmic record of past actions.  || 1 ||   Those
        who are pleasing to God are united with Him; He separates others
        from Himself. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of God; His greatness
        is glorious!  || 2 ||   CHHANT:  In the summer season, in the
        months of Jayt'h and Asaarh, the heat is terrible, intense
        and severe. The discarded bride is separated from His Love, and
        the Lord does not even look at her. She does not see her Lord,
        and she dies with an aching sigh; she is defrauded and plundered
        by her great pride. She flails around, like a fish out of water;
        attached to Maya, she is alienated from the Lord. She sins, and
        so she is fearful of reincarnation; the Messenger of Death will
        surely punish her. Prays Nanak, take me under Your sheltering
        support, Lord, and protect me; You are the Fulfiller of desire.
        || 3 ||   SHALOK:  With loving faith, I am attached to my Beloved;
        I cannot survive without Him, even for an instant. He is permeating
        and pervading my mind and body, O Nanak, with intuitive ease.
        || 1 ||   My Friend has taken me by the hand; He has been my
        best friend, lifetime after lifetime. He has made me the slave
        of His feet; O Nanak, my consciousness is filled with love for
        God.  || 2 ||   CHHANT:  The rainy season is beautiful; the months
        of Saawan and Bhaadon bring bliss. The clouds are low, and heavy
        with rain; the waters and the lands are filled with honey. God
        is all-pervading everywhere; the nine treasures of the Lord's
        Name fill the homes of all hearts. Meditating in remembrance on
        the Lord and Master, the Searcher of hearts, all one's
        ancestry is saved. No blemish sticks to that being who remains
        awake and aware in the Love of the Lord; the Merciful Lord is
        forever forgiving. Prays Nanak, I have found my Husband Lord,
        who is forever pleasing to my mind.  || 4 ||   SHALOK:  Thirsty
        with desire, I wander around; when will I behold the Lord of the
        World? Is there any humble Saint, any friend, O Nanak, who can
        lead me to meet with God?  || 1 ||   Without meeting Him, I have
        no peace or tranquility; I cannot survive for a moment, even for
        an instant. Entering the Sanctuary of the Lord's Holy Saints,
        O Nanak, my desires are fulfilled.  || 2 ||   CHHANT:  In the
        cool, autumn season, in the months of Assu and Katik, I am thirsty
        for the Lord. Searching for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan,
        I wander around wondering, when will I meet my Lord, the treasure
        of virtue? Without my Beloved Husband Lord, I find no peace, and
        all my necklaces and bracelets become cursed. So beautiful, so
        wise, so clever and knowing; still, without the breath, it is
        just a body. I look here and there, in the ten directions; my
        mind is so thirsty to meet God! Prays Nanak, shower Your Mercy
        upon me; unite me with Yourself, O God, O treasure of virtue.
        || 5 ||   SHALOK:  The fire of desire is cooled and quenched;
        my mind and body are filled with peace and tranquility. <br>

      <p> O Nanak, I have met my Perfect God; the illusion of duality is
        dispelled.  || 1 ||   The Lord Himself sent His Holy Saints, to
        tell us that He is not far away. O Nanak, doubt and fear are dispelled,
        chanting the Name of the all-pervading Lord.  || 2 ||   CHHANT:
        In the cold season of Maghar and Poh, the Lord reveals Himself.
        My burning desires were quenched, when I obtained the Blessed
        Vision of His Darshan; the fraudulent illusion of Maya is gone.
        All my desires have been fulfilled, meeting the Lord face-to-face;
        I am His servant, I serve at His feet. My necklaces, hair-ties,
        all decorations and adornments, are in singing the Glorious Praises
        of the unseen, mysterious Lord. I long for loving devotion to
        the Lord of the Universe, and so the Messenger of Death cannot
        even see me. Prays Nanak, God has united me with Himself; I shall
        never suffer separation from my Beloved again.  || 6 ||   SHALOK:
        The happy soul bride has found the wealth of the Lord; her consciousness
        does not waver. Joining together with the Saints, O Nanak, God,
        my Friend, has revealed Himself in my home.  || 1 ||   With her
        Beloved Husband Lord, she enjoys millions of melodies, pleasures
        and joys. The fruits of the mind's desires are obtained,
        O Nanak, chanting the Lord's Name.  || 2 ||   CHHANT: 
        The snowy winter season, the months of Maagh and Phagun, are pleasing
        and ennobling to the mind. O my friends and companions, sing the
        songs of joy; my Husband Lord has come into my home. My Beloved
        has come into my home; I meditate on Him in my mind. The bed of
        my heart is beautifully adorned. The woods, the meadows and the
        three worlds have blossomed forth in their greenery; gazing upon
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I am fascinated. I have met
        my Lord and Master, and my desires are fulfilled; my mind chants
        His Immaculate Mantra. Prays Nanak, I celebrate continuously;
        I have met my Husband Lord, the Lord of excellence.  || 7 || 
        SHALOK:  The Saints are the helpers, the support of the soul;
        they carry us cross the terrifying world-ocean. Know that they
        are the highest of all; O Nanak, they love the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Those who know Him, cross over; they are
        the brave heroes, the heroic warriors. Nanak is a sacrifice to
        those who meditate on the Lord, and cross over to the other shore.
        || 2 ||   CHHANT:  His feet are exalted above all. They eradicate
        all suffering. They destroy the pains of coming and going. They
        bring loving devotion to the Lord. Imbued with the Lord's
        Love, one is intoxicated with intuitive peace and poise, and does
        not forget the Lord from his mind, even for an instant. Shedding
        my self-conceit, I have entered the Sanctuary of His Feet; all
        virtues rest in the Lord of the Universe. I bow in humility to
        the Lord of the Universe, the treasure of virtue, the Lord of
        excellence, our Primal Lord and Master. Prays Nanak, shower me
        with Your Mercy, Lord; throughout the ages, You take the same
        form.  || 8 || 1 || 6 || 8 || </p>

        Guru.  || 3 ||   In love with duality, spiritual wisdom is lost;
        the mortal rots away in pride, and eats poison. He thinks that
        the sublime essence of the Guru's song is useless, and
        he does not like to hear it. He loses the profound, unfathomable
        Lord. Through the Guru's Words of Truth, the Ambrosial
        Nectar is obtained, and the mind and body find joy in the True
        Lord. He Himself is the Gurmukh, and He Himself bestows the Ambrosial
        Nectar; He Himself leads us to drink it in.  || 4 ||   Everyone
        says that God is the One and only, but they are engrossed in egotism
        and pride. Realize that the One God is inside and outside; understand
        this, that the Mansion of His Presence is within the home of your
        heart. God is near at hand; do not think that God is far away.
        The One Lord permeates the entire universe. There in One Universal
        Creator Lord; there is no other at all. O Nanak, merge into the
        One Lord.  || 5 ||   How can you keep the Creator under your control?
        He cannot be seized or measured. Maya has made the mortal insane;
        she has administered the poisonous drug of falsehood. Addicted
        to greed and avarice, the mortal is ruined, and then later, he
        regrets and repents. So serve the One Lord, and attain the state
        of Salvation; your comings and goings shall cease.  || 6 ||  
        The One Lord is in all actions, colors and forms. He manifests
        in many shapes through wind, water and fire. The One Soul wanders
        through the three worlds. One who understands and comprehends
        the One Lord is honored. One who gathers in spiritual wisdom and
        meditation, dwells in the state of balance. How rare are those
        who, as Gurmukh, attain the One Lord. They alone find peace, whom
        the Lord blesses with His Grace. In the Gurdwara, the Guru's
        Door, they speak and hear of the Lord.  || 7 ||   His Light illuminates
        the ocean and the earth. Throughout the three worlds, is the Guru,
        the Lord of the World. The Lord reveals His various forms; granting
        His Grace, He enters the home of the heart. The clouds hang low,
        and the rain is pouring down. The Lord embellishes and exalts
        with the Sublime Word of the Shabad. One who knows the mystery
        of the One God, is Himself the Creator, Himself the Divine Lord.
        || 8 ||   When the sun rises, the demons are slain; the mortal
        looks upwards, and contemplates the Shabad. The Lord is beyond
        the beginning and the end, beyond the three worlds. He Himself
        acts, speaks and listens. </p>
