      <p> Through the Naam, the fire of desire is extinguished; the Naam
        is obtained by His Will.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Dark Age
        of Kali Yuga, realize the Word of the Shabad. By this devotional
        worship, egotism is eliminated. Serving the True Guru, one becomes
        approved. So know the One, who created hope and desire.  || 2
        ||   What shall we offer to one who proclaims the Word of the
        Shabad? By His Grace, the Naam is enshrined within our minds.
        Offer your head, and shed your self-conceit. One who understands
        the Lord's Command finds lasting peace.  || 3 ||   He Himself
        does, and causes others to do. He Himself enshrines His Name in
        the mind of the Gurmukh. He Himself misleads us, and He Himself
        puts us back on the Path. Through the True Word of the Shabad,
        we merge into the True Lord.  || 4 ||   True is the Shabad, and
        True is the Word of the Lord's Bani. In each and every age,
        the Gurmukhs speak it and chant it. The self-willed manmukhs are
        deluded by doubt and attachment. Without the Name, everyone wanders
        around insane.  || 5 ||   Throughout the three worlds, is the
        one Maya. The fool reads and reads, but holds tight to duality.
        He performs all sorts of rituals, but still suffers terrible pain.
        Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained.  || 6 ||   Reflective
        meditation upon the Shabad is such sweet nectar. Night and day,
        one enjoys it, subduing his ego. When the Lord showers His Mercy,
        we enjoy celestial bliss. Imbued with the Naam, love the True
        Lord forever.  || 7 ||   Meditate on the Lord, and read and reflect
        upon the Guru's Shabad. Meditate on the Lord, and be imbued
        with fear and love of the True One. O Nanak, enshrine the Naam
        within your heart, through the Guru's Teachings.  || 8 || 3 ||

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:
        <p> RAAG AASAA,  THIRD MEHL,  ASHTAPADEES,  EIGHTH HOUSE,  KAAFEE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Peace emanates from the Guru; He puts out the fire of desire.
        The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained from the Guru; it
        is the greatest greatness.  || 1 ||   Keep the One Name in your
        consciousness, O my Siblings of Destiny. Seeing the world on fire,
        I have hurried to the Lord's Sanctuary.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Spiritual wisdom emanates from the Guru; reflect upon the
        supreme essence of reality. Through the Guru, the Lord's
        Mansion and His Court are attained; His devotional worship is
        overflowing with treasures.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukh meditates on
        the Naam; he achieves reflective meditation and understanding.
        The Gurmukh is the Lord's devotee, immersed in His Praises;
        the Infinite Word of the Shabad dwells within him.  || 3 ||  
        Happiness emanates from the Gurmukh; he never suffers pain. The
        Gurmukh conquers his ego, and his mind is immaculately pure. 
        || 4 ||   Meeting the True Guru, self-conceit is removed, and
        understanding of the three worlds is obtained. The Immaculate
        Divine Light is pervading and permeating everywhere; one's
        light merges into the Light.  || 5 ||   The Perfect Guru instructs,
        and one's intellect becomes sublime. A cooling and soothing
        peace comes within, and through the Naam, peace is obtained. 
        || 6 ||   One meets the Perfect True Guru only when the Lord bestows
        His Glance of Grace. All sins and vices are eradicated, and one
        shall never again suffer pain or distress. </p>

      <p> || 7 ||   Glory is in His Hands; He bestows His Name, and attaches
        us to it. O Nanak, the treasure of the Naam abides within the
        mind, and glory is obtained.  || 8 || 4 || 26 ||   AASAA,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Listen, O mortal: enshrine His Name within your mind; He
        shall come to meet with you, O my Sibling of Destiny. Night and
        day, center your consciousness on true devotional worship of the
        True Lord.  || 1 ||   Meditate on the One Naam, and you shall
        find peace, O my Siblings of Destiny. Eradicate egotism and duality,
        and your glory shall be glorious.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The angels,
        humans and silent sages long for this devotional worship, but
        without the True Guru, it cannot be attained. The Pandits, the
        religious scholars, and the astrologers read their books, but
        they do not understand.  || 2 ||   He Himself keeps all in His
        Hand; nothing else can be said. Whatever He gives, is received.
        The Guru has imparted this understanding to me.  || 3 ||   All
        beings and creatures are His; He belongs to all. So who can we
        call bad, since there is no other?  || 4 ||   The Command of the
        One Lord is pervading throughout; duty to the One Lord is upon
        the heads of all. He Himself has led them astray, and placed greed
        and corruption within their hearts.  || 5 ||   He has sanctified
        those few Gurmukhs who understand Him, and reflect upon Him. He
        grants devotional worship to them, and within them is the treasure.
        || 6 ||   The spiritual teachers know nothing but the Truth;
        they obtain true understanding. They are led astray by Him, but
        they do not go astray, because they know the True Lord.  || 7
        ||   Within the homes of their bodies, the five passions are pervading,
        but here, the five are well-behaved. O Nanak, without the True
        Guru, they are not overcome; through the Naam, the ego is conquered.
        || 8 || 5 || 27 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:  Everything is within
        the home of your own self; there is nothing beyond it. By Guru's
        Grace, it is obtained, and the doors of the inner heart are opened
        wide.  || 1 ||   From the True Guru, the Lord's Name is obtained,
        O Siblings of Destiny. The treasure of the Naam is within; the
        Perfect True Guru has shown this to me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        One who is a buyer of the Lord's Name, finds it, and obtains
        the jewel of contemplation. He opens the doors deep within, and
        through the Eyes of Divine Vision, beholds the treasure of liberation.
        || 2 ||   There are so many mansions within the body; the soul
        dwells within them. He obtains the fruits of his mind's desires,
        and he shall not have to go through reincarnation again.  || 3
        ||   The appraisers cherish the commodity of the Name; they obtain
        understanding from the Guru. The wealth of the Naam is priceless;
        how few are the Gurmukhs who obtain it.  || 4 ||   Searching outwardly,
        what can anyone find? The commodity is deep within the home of
        the self, O Siblings of Destiny. The entire world is wandering
        around, deluded by doubt; the self-willed manmukhs lose their
        honor.  || 5 ||   The false one leaves his own hearth and home,
        and goes out to another's home. Like a thief, he is caught,
        and without the Naam, he is beaten and struck down.  || 6 || 
        Those who know their own home, are happy, O Siblings of Destiny.
        They realize God within their own hearts, through the glorious
        greatness of the Guru.  || 7 ||   He Himself gives gifts, and
        He Himself bestows understanding; unto whom can we complain? O
        Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall
        obtain glory in the True Court.  || 8 || 6 || 28 || </p>

      <p> AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who recognize their own selves, enjoy
        the sweet flavor, O Siblings of Destiny. Those who drink in the
        sublime essence of the Lord are emancipated; they love the Truth.
        || 1 ||   The Beloved Lord is the purest of the pure; He comes
        to dwell in the pure mind. Praising the Lord, through the Guru's
        Teachings, one remains unaffected by corruption.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Without the Word of the Shabad, they do not understand themselves
        - they are totally blind, O Siblings of Destiny. Through the
        Guru's Teachings, the heart is illuminated, and in the end,
        only the Naam shall be your companion.  || 2 ||   They are occupied
        with the Naam, and only the Naam; they deal only in the Naam.
        Deep within their hearts is the Naam; upon their lips is the Naam;
        they contemplate the Word of God, and the Naam. || 3 ||   They
        listen to the Naam, believe in the Naam, and through the Naam,
        they obtain glory. They praise the Naam, forever and ever, and
        through the Naam, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
        || 4 ||   Through the Naam, their hearts are illumined, and through
        the Naam, they obtain honor. Through the Naam, peace wells up;
        I seek the Sanctuary of the Naam.  || 5 ||   Without the Naam,
        no one is accepted; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor.
        In the City of Death, they are tied down and beaten, and they
        lose their lives in vain.  || 6 ||   Those Gurmukhs who realize
        the Naam, all serve the Naam. So believe in the Naam, and only
        the Naam; through the Naam, glorious greatness is obtained.  ||
        7 ||   He alone receives it, unto whom it is given. Through the
        Guru's Teachings, the Naam is realized. O Nanak, everything
        is under the influence of the Naam; by perfect good destiny, a
        few obtain it.  || 8 || 7 || 29 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:  The
        deserted brides do not obtain the Mansion of their Husband's
        Presence, nor do they know His taste. They speak harsh words,
        and do not bow to Him; they are in love with another.  || 1 ||
        How can this mind come under control? By Guru's Grace,
        it is held in check; instructed in spiritual wisdom, it returns
        to its home.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself adorns the happy
        soul-brides; they bear Him love and affection. They live in harmony
        with the Sweet Will of the True Guru, naturally adorned with the
        Naam.  || 2 ||   They enjoy their Beloved forever, and their bed
        is decorated with Truth. They are fascinated with the Love of
        their Husband Lord; meeting their Beloved, they obtain peace.
        || 3 ||   Spiritual wisdom is the incomparable decoration of
        the happy soul-bride. She is so beautiful  -  she is the queen
        of all; she enjoys the love and affection of her Husband Lord.
        || 4 ||   The True Lord, the Unseen, the Infinite, has infused
        His Love among the happy soul-brides. They serve their True Guru,
        with true love and affection.  || 5 ||   The happy soul-bride
        has adorned herself with the necklace of virtue. She applies the
        perfume of love to her body, and within her mind is the jewel
        of reflective meditation.  || 6 ||   Those who are imbued with
        devotional worship are the most exalted. Their social standing
        and honor come from the Word of the Shabad. Without the Naam,
        all are low class, like maggots in manure.  || 7 ||   Everyone
        proclaims, &quot;Me, me!&quot;; but without the Shabad, the ego
        does not depart. O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam lose
        their ego; they remain absorbed in the True Lord.  || 8 || 8 ||
        30 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who are imbued with the True
        Lord are spotless and pure; their reputation is forever true. </p>

      <p> Here, they are known in each and every home, and hereafter, they
        are famous throughout the ages.  || 1 ||   O beauteous and joyful
        mind, imbue yourself with your true color. If you imbue yourself
        with the Beauteous Word of the Guru's Bani, then this color
        shall never fade away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am lowly, filthy,
        and totally egotistical; I am attached to the corruption of duality.
        But meeting with the Guru, the Philosopher's Stone, I am
        transformed into gold; I am blended with the Pure Light of the
        Infinite Lord.  || 2 ||   Without the Guru, no one is imbued with
        the color of the Lord's Love; meeting with the Guru, this
        color is applied. Those who are imbued with the Fear, and the
        Love of the Guru, are absorbed in the Praise of the True Lord.
        || 3 ||   Without fear, the cloth is not dyed, and the mind is
        not rendered pure. Without fear, the performance of rituals is
        false, and one finds no place of rest.  || 4 ||   Only those whom
        the Lord imbues, are so imbued; they join the Sat Sangat, the
        True Congregation. From the Perfect Guru, the Sat Sangat emanates,
        and one easily merges into the Love of the True One.  || 5 ||
        Without the Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all remain like
        beasts and animals. They do not know the One who created them;
        without the Name, all are thieves.  || 6 ||   Some purchase merits
        and sell off their demerits; through the Guru, they obtain peace
        and poise. Serving the Guru, they obtain the Name, which comes
        to dwell deep within.  || 7 ||   The One Lord is the Giver of
        all; He assigns tasks to each and every person. O Nanak, the Lord
        embellishes us with the Name; attached to the Word of the Shabad,
        we are merged into Him.  || 8 || 9 || 31 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:
        Everyone longs for the Name, but he alone receives it, unto whom
        the Lord shows His Mercy. Without the Name, there is only pain;
        he alone obtains peace, whose mind is filled with the Name.  ||
        1 ||   You are infinite and merciful; I seek Your Sanctuary. From
        the Perfect Guru, the glorious greatness of the Naam is obtained.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Inwardly and outwardly, there is only the
        One Lord. He has created the world, with its many varieties. According
        to the Order of His Will, He makes us act. What else can we talk
        about, O Siblings of Destiny?  || 2 ||   Knowledge and ignorance
        are all your making; You have control over these. Some, You forgive,
        and unite with Yourself; while others, the wicked, you strike
        down and drive out of Your Court.  || 3 ||   Some, from the very
        beginning, are pure and pious; You attach them to Your Name. Serving
        the Guru, peace wells up; through the True Word of the Shabad,
        one comes to understand.  || 4 ||   Some are crooked, filthy and
        vicious; the Lord Himself has led them astray from the Name. They
        have no intuition, no understanding and no self-discipline; they
        wander around delirious.  || 5 ||   He grants faith to those whom
        He has blessed with His Glance of Grace. This mind finds truth,
        contentment and self-discipline, hearing the Immaculate Word of
        the Shabad.  || 6 ||   By reading books, one cannot reach Him;
        by speaking and talking, His limits cannot be found. Through the
        Guru, His value is found; through the True Word of the Shabad,
        understanding is obtained.  || 7 ||   So reform this mind and
        body, by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. O Nanak,
        within this body is the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord; it is found through the Love of the Infinite Guru.  || 8
        || 10 || 32 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:  The happy soul-brides are

        Shabad. </p>

      <p> They find their Husband Lord within their own home, contemplating
        the True Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||   Through merits, their
        demerits are forgiven, and they embrace love for the Lord. The
        soul-bride then obtains the Lord as her Husband; meeting the Guru,
        this union comes about.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Some do not know
        the Presence of their Husband Lord; they are deluded by duality
        and doubt. How can the forsaken brides meet Him? Their life night
        passes in pain.  || 2 ||   Those whose minds are filled with the
        True Lord, perform truthful actions. Night and day, they serve
        the Lord with poise, and are absorbed in the True Lord.  || 3
        ||   The forsaken brides wander around, deluded by doubt; telling
        lies, they eat poison. They do not know their Husband Lord, and
        upon their deserted bed, they suffer in misery.  || 4 ||   The
        True Lord is the One and only; do not be deluded by doubt, O my
        mind. Consult with the Guru, serve the True Lord, and enshrine
        the Immaculate Truth within your mind.  || 5 ||   The happy soul-bride
        always finds her Husband Lord; she banishes egotism and self-conceit.
        She remains attached to her Husband Lord, night and day, and she
        finds peace upon His Bed of Truth.  || 6 ||   Those who shouted,
  &quot;Mine, mine!&quot; have departed, without obtaining anything.
        The separated one does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, and departs, repenting in the end.  || 7 ||   That Husband
        Lord of mine is the One and only; I am in love with the One alone.
        O Nanak, if the soul-bride longs for peace, she should enshrine
        the Lord's Name within her mind.  || 8 || 11 || 33 ||   AASAA,
        THIRD MEHL:  Those whom the Lord has caused to drink in the Ambrosial
        Nectar, naturally, intuitively, enjoy the sublime essence. The
        True Lord is care-free; he does not have even an iota of greed.
        || 1 ||   The True Ambrosial Nectar rains down, and trickles
        into the mouths of the Gurmukhs. Their minds are forever rejuvenated,
        and they naturally, intuitively, sing the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukhs are forever
        forsaken brides; they cry out and bewail at the Lord's Gate.
        Those who do not enjoy the sublime taste of their Husband Lord,
        act according to their pre-ordained destiny.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukh
        plants the seed of the True Name, and it sprouts. He deals in
        the True Name alone. Those whom the Lord has attached to this
        profitable venture, are granted the treasure of devotional worship.
        || 3 ||   The Gurmukh is forever the true, happy soul-bride;
        she adorns herself with the fear of God and devotion to Him. Night
        and day, she enjoys her Husband Lord; she keeps Truth enshrined
        within her heart.  || 4 ||   I am a sacrifice to those who have
        enjoyed their Husband Lord. They dwell forever with their Husband
        Lord; they eradicate self-conceit from within.  || 5 ||   Their
        bodies and minds are cooled and soothed, and their faces are radiant,
        from the love and affection of their Husband Lord. They enjoy
        their Husband Lord upon His cozy bed, having conquered their ego
        and desire.  || 6 ||   Granting His Grace, He comes into our homes,
        through our infinite Love for the Guru. The happy soul-bride obtains
        the One Lord as her Husband.  || 7 ||   All of her sins are forgiven;
        the Uniter unites her with Himself. O Nanak, chant such chants,
        that hearing them, He may enshrine love for you.  || 8 || 12 ||

      <p> Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with intuitive ease
        and poise, spiritual wisdom is revealed.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        do not think of the Lord as being far away; behold Him ever close
        at hand. He is always listening, and always watching over us;
        the Word of His Shabad is all-pervading everywhere.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   The Gurmukhs understand their own selves; they meditate
        single-mindedly on the Lord. They enjoy their Husband Lord continually;
        through the True Name, they find peace.  || 2 ||   O my mind,
        no one belongs to you; contemplate the Shabad, and see this. So
        run to the Lord's Sanctuary, and find the gate of salvation.
        || 3 ||   Listen to the Shabad, and understand the Shabad, and
        lovingly focus your consciousness on the True One. Through the
        Shabad, conquer your ego, and in the True Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, you shall find peace.  || 4 ||   In this age, the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, is glory; without the Name, there is no
        glory. The glory of this Maya lasts for only a few days; it disappears
        in an instant.  || 5 ||   Those who forget the Naam are already
        dead, and they continue dying. They do not enjoy the sublime essence
        of the Lord's taste; they sink into the manure.  || 6 ||
        Some are forgiven by the Lord; He unites them with Himself,
        and keeps them attached to the Naam, night and day. They practice
        Truth, and abide in Truth; being truthful, they merge into Truth.
        || 7 ||   Without the Shabad, the world does not hear, and does
        not see; deaf and blind, it wanders around. Without the Naam,
        it obtains only misery; the Naam is received only by His Will.
        || 8 ||   Those persons who link their consciousness with the
        Word of His Bani, are immaculately pure, and approved by the Lord.
        O Nanak, they never forget the Naam, and in the Court of the Lord,
        they are known as true.  || 9 || 13 || 35 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:
        Through the Word of the Shabad, the devotees are known; their
        words are true. They eradicate ego from within themselves; they
        surrender to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and meet with the
        True One.  || 1 ||   Through the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, His
        humble servants obtain honor. How blessed is their coming into
        the world! Everyone adores them.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Ego, self-centeredness,
        excessive anger and pride are the lot of mankind. If one dies
        in the Word of the Shabad, then he is rid of this, and his light
        is merged into the Light of the Lord God.  || 2 ||   Meeting with
        the Perfect True Guru, my life has been blessed. I have obtained
        the nine treasures of the Naam, and my storehouse is inexhaustible,
        filled to overflowing.  || 3 ||   Those who love the Naam come
        as dealers in the merchandise of the Naam. Those who become Gurmukh
        obtain this wealth; deep within, they contemplate the Shabad.
        || 4 ||   The egotistical, self-willed manmukhs do not appreciate
        the value of devotional worship. The Primal Lord Himself has beguiled
        them; they lose their lives in the gamble.  || 5 ||   Without
        loving affection, devotional worship is not possible, and the
        body cannot be at peace. The wealth of love is obtained from the
        Guru; through devotion, the mind becomes steady.  || 6 ||   He
        alone performs devotional worship, whom the Lord so blesses; he
        contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The One Name
        abides in his heart, and he conquers his ego and duality.  ||
        7 ||   The One Name is the social status and honor of the devotees;
        the Lord Himself adorns them. They remain forever in the Protection
        of His Sanctuary. </p>

      <p> As it pleases His Will, He arranges their affairs.  || 8 ||  
        The worship of the Lord is unique  -  it is known only by reflecting
        upon the Guru. O Nanak, one whose mind is filled with the Naam,
        through the Lord's Fear and devotion, is embellished with
        the Naam.  || 9 || 14 || 36 ||   AASAA,  THIRD MEHL:  He wanders
        around, engrossed in other pleasures, but without the Naam, he
        suffers in pain. He does not meet the True Guru, the Primal Being,
        who imparts true understanding.  || 1 ||   O my insane mind, drink
        in the sublime essence of the Lord, and savor its taste. Attached
        to other pleasures, you wander around, and your life wastes away
        uselessly.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In this age, the Gurmukhs are
        pure; they remain absorbed in the love of the True Name. Without
        the destiny of good karma, nothing can be obtained; what can we
        say or do?  || 2 ||   He understands his own self, and dies in
        the Word of the Shabad; he banishes corruption from his mind.
        He hurries to the Guru's Sanctuary, and is forgiven by the
        Forgiving Lord.  || 3 ||   Without the Name, peace is not obtained,
        and pain does not depart from within. This world is engrossed
        in attachment to Maya; it has gone astray in duality and doubt.
        || 4 ||   The forsaken soul-brides do not know the value of their
        Husband Lord; how can they decorate themselves? Night and day,
        they continually burn, and they do not enjoy the Bed of their
        Husband Lord.  || 5 ||   The happy soul-brides obtain the Mansion
        of His Presence, eradicating their self-conceit from within. They
        decorate themselves with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and
        their Husband Lord unites them with Himself.  || 6 ||   He has
        forgotten death, in the darkness of attachment to Maya. The self-willed
        manmukhs die again and again, and are reborn; they die again,
        and are miserable at the Gate of Death.  || 7 ||   They alone
        are united, whom the Lord unites with Himself; they contemplate
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. O Nanak, they are absorbed
        in the Naam; their faces are radiant, in that True Court.  ||

      <p> When the five virtues were reconciled, and the five passions were
        estranged, I enshrined the five within myself, and cast out the
        other five.  || 1 ||   In this way, the village of my body became
        inhabited, O my Siblings of Destiny. Vice departed, and the Guru's
        spiritual wisdom was implanted within me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The fence of true Dharmic religion has been built around it.
        The spiritual wisdom and reflective meditation of the Guru has
        become its strong gate.  || 2 ||   So plant the seed of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, O friends, O Siblings of Destiny. Deal only
        in the constant service of the Guru.  || 3 ||   With intuitive
        peace and happiness, all the shops are filled. The Banker and
        the dealers dwell in the same place.  || 4 ||   There is no tax
        on non-believers, nor any fines or taxes at death. The True Guru
        has set the Seal of the Primal Lord upon these goods.  || 5 ||
        So load the merchandise of the Naam, and set sail with your
        cargo. Earn your profit, as Gurmukh, and you shall return to your
        own home.  || 6 ||   The True Guru is the Banker, and His Sikhs
        are the traders. Their merchandise is the Naam, and meditation
        on the True Lord is their account.  || 7 ||   One who serves the
        True Guru dwells in this house. O Nanak, the Divine City is eternal.

      <p> My mind is in love with the Lord. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; my lifestyle is
        pure and true.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have such a great thirst
        for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; I think of him in so many
        ways. So be Merciful, O Supreme Lord; shower Your Mercy upon me,
        O Lord, Destroyer of pride.  || 1 ||   My stranger soul has come
        to join the Saadh Sangat. That commodity, which I longed for,
        I have found in the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  ||
        2 ||   There are so many pleasures and delights of Maya, but they
        pass away in an instant. Your devotees are imbued with Your Name;
        they enjoy peace everywhere.  || 3 ||   The entire world is seen
        to be passing away; only the Lord's Name is lasting and stable.
        So make friends with the Holy Saints, so that you may obtain a
        lasting place of rest.  || 4 ||   Friends, acquaintances, children
        and relatives  -  none of these shall be your companion. The
        Lord's Name alone shall go with you; God is the Master of
        the meek.  || 5 ||   The Lord's Lotus Feet are the Boat;
        attached to Them, you shall cross over the world-ocean. Meeting
        with the Perfect True Guru, I embrace True Love for God.  || 6
        ||   The prayer of Your Holy Saints is, &quot;May I never forget
        You, for even one breath or morsel of food.&quot;  Whatever is
        pleasing to Your Will is good; by Your Sweet Will, my affairs
        are adjusted.  || 7 ||   I have met my Beloved, the Ocean of Peace,
        and Supreme Bliss has welled up within me. Says Nanak, all my
        pains have been eradicated, meeting with God, the Lord of Supreme
        Bliss.  || 8 || 1 || 2 || </p>

        Him, sorrows are forgotten, O Beloved; how can one forsake Him?
        || 2 ||   I would sell this body to the Saint, O Beloved, if
        he would lead me to my Dear Lord.  || 3 ||   The pleasures and
        adornments of corruption are insipid and useless; I have forsaken
        and abandoned them, O my Mother.  || 4 ||   Lust, anger and greed
        left me, O Beloved, when I fell at the Feet of the True Guru.
        || 5 ||   Those humble beings who are imbued with the Lord, O
        Beloved, do not go anywhere else.  || 6 ||   Those who have tasted
        the Lord's sublime essence, O Beloved, remain satisfied and
        satiated.  || 7 ||   One who grasps the Hem of the Gown of the
        Holy Saint, O Nanak, crosses over the terrible world-ocean.  ||

        is so Beautiful, so Refined, so Wise  -  He is my very life!
        Reveal to me Your Darshan!  || 2 ||   Those beings who are separated
        from You, O Beloved, are born only to die; they eat the poison
        of corruption.  || 3 ||   He alone meets You, whom You cause to
        meet, O Beloved; I fall at his feet.  || 4 ||   That happiness

      </center>
      <p> Sassa:  He who created the world, is the One Lord and Master of
        all. Those whose consciousness remains committed to His Service
        -  blessed is their birth and their coming into the world.
        || 1 ||   O mind, why forget Him? You foolish mind! When your
        account is adjusted, O brother, only then shall you be judged
        wise.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Eeree:  The Primal Lord is the Giver;
        He alone is True. No accounting is due from the Gurmukh who understands
        the Lord through these letters.  || 2 ||   Ooraa:  Sing the Praises
        of the One whose limit cannot be found. Those who perform service
        and practice truth, obtain the fruits of their rewards.  || 3
        ||   Nganga:  One who understands spiritual wisdom becomes a Pandit,
        a religious scholar. One who recognizes the One Lord among all
        beings does not talk of ego.  || 4 ||   Kakka:  When the hair
        grows grey, then it shines without shampoo. The hunters of the
        King of Death come, and bind him in the chains of Maya.  || 5
        ||   Khakha:  The Creator is the King of the world; He enslaves
        by giving nourishment. By His Binding, all the world is bound;
        no other Command prevails.  || 6 ||   Gagga:  One who renounces
        the singing of the songs of the Lord of the Universe, becomes
        arrogant in his speech. One who has shaped the pots, and made
        the world the kiln, decides when to put them in it.  || 7 || 
        Ghagha:  The servant who performs service, remains attached to
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. One who recognizes bad and
        good as one and the same  -  in this way he is absorbed into
        the Lord and Master.  || 8 ||   Chacha:  He created the four Vedas,
        the four sources of creation, and the four ages  -  through
        each and every age, He Himself has been the Yogi, the enjoyer,
        the Pandit and the scholar. </p>

      <p> || 9 ||   Chhachha:  Ignorance exists within everyone; doubt is
        Your doing, O Lord. Having created doubt, You Yourself cause them
        to wander in delusion; t_hose whom You bless with Your Mercy meet
        with the Guru.  || 10 ||   Jajja:  That humble being who begs
        for wisdom has wandered begging through 8.4 million incarnations.
        The One Lord takes away, and the One Lord gives; I have not heard
        of any other.  || 11 ||   Jhajha:  O mortal being, why are you
        dying of anxiety? Whatever the Lord is to give, He shall keep
        on giving. He gives, and gives, and watches over us; according
        to the Orders which He issues, His beings receive nourishment.
        || 12 ||   Nyanya:  When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace,
        then I do not behold any other. The One Lord is totally pervading
        everywhere; the One Lord abides within the mind.  || 13 ||   Tatta:
        Why do you practice hypocrisy, O mortal? In a moment, in an instant,
        you shall have to get up and depart. Don't lose your life
        in the gamble  -  hurry to the Lord's Sanctuary.  || 14
        ||   T'hat'ha:  Peace pervades within those who link
        their consciousness to the Lord's Lotus Feet. Those humble
        beings, whose consciousness is so linked, are saved; by Your Grace,
        they obtain peace.  || 15 ||   Dadda:  Why do you make such ostentatious
        shows, O mortal? Whatever exists, shall all pass away. So serve
        Him, who is contained and pervading among everyone, and you shall
        obtain peace.  || 16 ||   Dhadha:  He Himself establishes and
        disestablishes; as it pleases His Will, so does He act. Having
        created the creation, He watches over it; He issues His Commands,
        and emancipates those, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace.
        || 17 ||   Nanna:  One whose heart is filled with the Lord, sings
        His Glorious Praises. One whom the Creator Lord unites with Himself,
        is not consigned to reincarnation.  || 18 ||   Tatta:  The terrible
        world-ocean is so very deep; its limits cannot be found. I do
        not have a boat, or even a raft; I am drowning  -  save me,
        O Savior King!  || 19 ||   T'hat'ha:  In all places
        and interspaces, He is; everything which exists, is by His doing.
        What is doubt? What is called Maya? Whatever pleases Him is good.
        || 20 ||   Dadda:  Do not blame anyone else; blame instead your
        own actions. Whatever I did, for that I have suffered; I do not
        blame anyone else.  || 21 ||   Dhadha:  His power established
        and upholds the earth; the Lord has imparted His color to everything.
        His gifts are received by everyone; all act according to His Command.
        || 22 ||   Nanna:  The Husband Lord enjoys eternal pleasures,
        but He is not seen or understood. I am called the happy soul-bride,
        O sister, but my Husband Lord has never met me.  || 23 ||   Pappa:
        The Supreme King, the Transcendent Lord, created the world, and
        watches over it. He sees and understands, and knows everything;
        inwardly and outwardly, he is fully pervading.  || 24 ||   Faffa:
        The whole world is caught in the noose of Death, and all are
        bound by its chains. By Guru's Grace, they alone are saved,
        who hurry to enter the Lord's Sanctuary.  || 25 ||   Babba:

      <p> He made all beings and creatures his chessmen, and He Himself
        threw the dice.  || 26 ||   Bhabha:  Those who search, find the
        fruits of their rewards; by Guru's Grace, they live in the
        Fear of God. The self-willed manmukhs wander around, and they
        do not remember the Lord; the fools are consigned to the cycle
        of 8.4 million incarnations.  || 27 ||   Mamma:  In emotional
        attachment, he dies; he only thinks of the Lord, the Love of Nectar,
        when he dies. As long as the body is alive, he reads other things,
        and forgets the letter 'm', which stands for marnaa
        -  death.  || 28 ||   Yaya:  He is never reincarnated again,
        if he recognizes the True Lord. The Gurmukh speaks, the Gurmukh
        understands, and the Gurmukh knows only the One Lord.  || 29 ||
        Rarra:  The Lord is contained among all; He created all beings.
        Having created His beings, He has put them all to work; they alone
        remember the Naam, upon whom He bestows His Grace.  || 30 || 
        Lalla:  He has assigned people to their tasks, and made the love
        of Maya seem sweet to them. We eat and drink; we should endure
        equally whatever occurs, by His Will, by His Command.  || 31 ||
        Wawa:  The all-pervading Transcendent Lord beholds the world;
        He created the form it wears. He beholds, tastes, and knows everything;
        He is pervading and permeating inwardly and outwardly.  || 32
        ||   Rarra:  Why do you quarrel, O mortal? Meditate on the Imperishable
        Lord, and be absorbed into the True One. Become a sacrifice to
        Him.  || 33 ||   Haha:  There is no other Giver than Him; having
        created the creatures, He gives them nourishment. Meditate on
        the Lord's Name, be absorbed into the Lord's Name, and
        night and day, reap the Profit of the Lord's Name.  || 34
        ||   Airaa:  He Himself created the world; whatever He has to
        do, He continues to do. He acts, and causes others to act, and
        He knows everything; so says Nanak, the poet.  || 35 || 1 || </p>

        RAAG AASAA,  THIRD MEHL,  PATEE  -  THE ALPHABET:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Ayo, Angai:  The whole world which was created  -  Kaahkai,
        Ghangai:  It shall pass away.  Reeree, Laalee:  People commit
        sins, and falling into vice, forget virtue.  || 1 ||   O mortal,
        why have you studied such an account, which shall call you to
        answer for payment?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sidhan, Ngaayiyai: 
        You do not remember the Lord.  Nanna:  You do not take the Lord's
        Name.  Chhachha:  You are wearing away, every night and day; you
        fool, how will you find release? You are held in the grip of death.
        || 2 ||   Babba:  You do not understand, you fool; deluded by
        doubt, you are wasting your life. Without justification, you call
        yourself a teacher; thus you take on the loads of others.  ||
        3 ||   Jajja:  You have been robbed of your Light, you fool; in
        the end, you shall have to depart, and you shall regret and repent.
        You have not remembered the One Word of the Shabad, and so you
        shall have to enter the womb over and over again.  || 4 ||   Read
        that which is written on your forehead, O Pandit, and do not teach
        wickedness to others. <br>
