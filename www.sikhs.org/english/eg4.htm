      <p> No one has found Him by stubborn-mindedness. All have grown weary
        of the effort. Thousands of clever mental tricks have been tried,
        but still, the raw and undisciplined mind does not absorb the
        Color of the Lord's Love. By falsehood and deception, none
        have found Him. Whatever you plant, you shall eat.  || 3 ||  
        O God, You are the Hope of all. All beings are Yours; You are
        the Wealth of all. O God, none return from You empty-handed; at
        Your Door, the Gurmukhs are praised and acclaimed. In the terrifying
        world-ocean of poison, people are drowning - please lift them
        up and save them! This is servant Nanak's humble prayer.
        || 4 || 1 || 65 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FOURTH MEHL:  Receiving the
        Naam, the mind is satisfied; without the Naam, life is cursed.
        If I meet the Gurmukh, my Spiritual Friend, he will show me God,
        the Treasure of Excellence. I am every bit a sacrifice to one
        who reveals to me the Naam.  || 1 ||   O my Beloved, I live by
        meditating on Your Name. Without Your Name, my life does not even
        exist. My True Guru has implanted the Naam within me.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The Naam is a Priceless Jewel; it is with the Perfect
        True Guru. When one is enjoined to serve the True Guru, He brings
        out this Jewel and bestows this enlightenment. Blessed, and most
        fortunate of the very fortunate, are those who come to meet the
        Guru.  || 2 ||   Those who have not met the Primal Being, the
        True Guru, are most unfortunate, and are subject to death. They
        wander in reincarnation over and over again, as the most disgusting
        maggots in manure. Do not meet with, or even approach those people,
        whose hearts are filled with horrible anger.  || 3 ||   The True
        Guru, the Primal Being, is the Pool of Ambrosial Nectar. The very
        fortunate ones come to bathe in it. The filth of many incarnations
        is washed away, and the Immaculate Naam is implanted within. Servant
        Nanak has obtained the most exalted state, lovingly attuned to
        the True Guru.  || 4 || 2 || 66 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FOURTH MEHL:
        I sing His Glories, I describe His Glories, I speak of His Glories,
        O my mother. The Gurmukhs, my spiritual friends, bestow virtue.
        Meeting with my spiritual friends, I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord. The Diamond of the Guru has pierced the diamond of
        my mind, which is now dyed in the deep crimson color of the Name.
        || 1 ||   O my Lord of the Universe, singing Your Glorious Praises,
        my mind is satisfied. Within me is the thirst for the Lord's
        Name; may the Guru, in His Pleasure, grant it to me.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Let your minds be imbued with His Love, O blessed
        and fortunate ones. By His Pleasure, the Guru bestows His Gifts.
        The Guru has lovingly implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        within me; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. Without the True
        Guru, the Name of the Lord is not found, even though people may
        perform hundreds of thousands, even millions of rituals.  || 2
        ||   Without destiny, the True Guru is not found, even though
        He sits within the home of our own inner being, always near and
        close at hand. There is ignorance within, and the pain of doubt,
        like a separating screen. Without meeting with the True Guru,
        no one is transformed into gold. The self-willed manmukh sinks
        like iron, while the boat is very close.  || 3 ||   The Boat of
        the True Guru is the Name of the Lord. How can we climb on board?
        One who walks in harmony with the True Guru's Will comes
        to sit in this Boat. Blessed, blessed are those very fortunate
        ones, O Nanak, who are united with the Lord through the True Guru.

      <p> SIREE RAAG,  FOURTH MEHL:  I stand by the wayside and ask the
        Way. If only someone would show me the Way to God - I would
        go with him. I follow in the footsteps of those who enjoy the
        Love of my Beloved. I beg of them, I implore them; I have such
        a yearning to meet God!  || 1 ||   O my Siblings of Destiny, please
        unite me in Union with my Lord God. I am a sacrifice to the True
        Guru, who has shown me the Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In
        deep humility, I fall at the Feet of the Perfect True Guru. The
        Guru is the Honor of the dishonored. The Guru, the True Guru,
        brings approval and applause. I am never tired of praising the
        Guru, who unites me with the Lord God.  || 2 ||   Everyone, all
        over the world, longs for the True Guru. Without the good fortune
        of destiny, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is not obtained.
        The unfortunate ones just sit and cry. All things happen according
        to the Will of the Lord God. No one can erase the pre-ordained
        Writ of Destiny.  || 3 ||   He Himself is the True Guru; He Himself
        is the Lord. He Himself unites in His Union. In His Kindness,
        He unites us with Himself, as we follow the Guru, the True Guru.
        Over all the world, He is the Life of the World, O Nanak, like
        water mingled with water.  || 4 || 4 || 68 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  The Essence of the Ambrosial Naam is the most sublime essence;
        how can I get to taste this essence? I go and ask the happy soul-brides,
  &quot;How did you come to meet God?&quot; They are care-free and
        do not speak; I massage and wash their feet.  || 1 ||   O Siblings
        of Destiny, meet with your spiritual friend, and dwell upon the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord. The True Guru, the Primal Being,
        is your Friend, who shall drive out pain and subdue your ego.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Gurmukhs are the happy soul-brides;
        their minds are filled with kindness. The Word of the True Guru
        is the Jewel. One who believes in it tastes the Sublime Essence
        of the Lord. Those who partake of the Lord's Sublime Essence,
        through the Guru's Love, are known as great and very fortunate.
        || 2 ||   This Sublime Essence of the Lord is in the forests,
        in the fields and everywhere, but the unfortunate ones do not
        taste it. Without the True Guru, it is not obtained. The self-willed
        manmukhs continue to cry in misery. They do not bow before the
        True Guru; the demon of anger is within them.  || 3 ||   The Lord
        Himself, Har, Har, Har, is the Sublime Essence. The Lord Himself
        is the Essence. In His Kindness, He blesses the Gurmukh with it;
        the Ambrosial Nectar of this Amrit trickles down. Then, the body
        and mind totally blossom forth and flourish; O Nanak, the Lord
        comes to dwell within the mind.  || 4 || 5 || 69 ||   SIREE RAAG,
        FOURTH MEHL:  The day dawns, and then it ends, and the night
        passes away. Man's life is diminishing, but he does not understand.
        Each day, the mouse of death is gnawing away at the rope of life.
        Maya spreads out like sweet molasses; the self-willed manmukh
        is stuck like a fly, rotting away.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny,
        God is my Friend and Companion. Emotional attachment to children
        and spouse is poison; in the end, no one will go along with you
        as your helper.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> Through the Guru's Teachings, some embrace love for the Lord,
        and are saved. They remain detached and unaffected, and they find
        the Sanctuary of the Lord. They keep death constantly before their
        eyes; they gather the Provisions of the Lord's Name, and
        receive honor. The Gurmukhs are honored in the Court of the Lord.
        The Lord Himself takes them in His Loving Embrace.  || 2 ||  
        For the Gurmukhs, the Way is obvious. At the Lord's Door,
        they face no obstructions. They praise the Lord's Name, they
        keep the Naam in their minds, and they remain attached to the
        Love of the Naam. The Unstruck Celestial Music vibrates for them
        at the Lord's Door, and they are honored at the True Door.
        || 3 ||   Those Gurmukhs who praise the Naam are applauded by
        everyone. Grant me their company, God - I am a beggar; this
        is my prayer. O Nanak, great is the good fortune of those Gurmukhs,
        who are filled with the Light of the Naam within.  || 4 || 33
        || 31 || 6 || 70 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE: 
        Why are you so thrilled by the sight of your son and your beautifully
        decorated wife? You enjoy tasty delicacies, you have lots of fun,
        and you indulge in endless pleasures. You give all sorts of commands,
        and you act so superior. The Creator does not come into the mind
        of the blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukh.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        the Lord is the Giver of peace. By Guru's Grace, He is found.
        By His Mercy, He is obtained.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   People are
        entangled in the enjoyment of fine clothes, but gold and silver
        are only dust. They acquire beautiful horses and elephants, and
        ornate carriages of many kinds. They think of nothing else, and
        they forget all their relatives. They ignore their Creator; without
        the Name, they are impure.  || 2 ||   Gathering the wealth of
        Maya, you earn an evil reputation. Those whom you work to please
        shall pass away along with you. The egotistical are engrossed
        in egotism, ensnared by the intellect of the mind. One who is
        deceived by God Himself, has no position and no honor.  || 3 ||
        The True Guru, the Primal Being, has led me to meet the One,
        my only Friend. The One is the Saving Grace of His humble servant.
        Why should the proud cry out in ego? As the servant of the Lord
        wills, so does the Lord act. At the Lord's Door, none of
        his requests are denied. Nanak is attuned to the Love of the Lord,
        whose Light pervades the entire Universe.  || 4 || 1 || 71 ||
        SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  With the mind caught up in playful
        pleasures, involved in all sorts of amusements and sights that
        stagger the eyes, people are led astray. The emperors sitting
        on their thrones are consumed by anxiety.  || 1 ||   O Siblings
        of Destiny, peace is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy. If the Supreme Lord, the Architect of Destiny, writes
        such an order, then anguish and anxiety are erased.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   There are so many places - I have wandered through
        them all. The masters of wealth and the great land-lords have
        fallen, crying out, &quot;This is mine! This is mine!&quot;  ||
        2 ||   They issue their commands fearlessly, and act in pride.
        They subdue all under their command, but without the Name, they
        are reduced to dust.  || 3 ||   Even those who are served by the
        33 million angelic beings, at whose door the Siddhas and the Saadhus
        stand, who live in wondrous affluence and rule over mountains,
        oceans and vast dominions - </p>

      <p> O Nanak, in the end, all this vanishes like a dream!  || 4 ||
        2 || 72 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Arising each day, you cherish
        your body, but you are idiotic, ignorant and without understanding.
        You are not conscious of God, and your body shall be cast into
        the wilderness. Focus your consciousness on the True Guru; you
        shall enjoy bliss forever and ever.  || 1 ||   O mortal, you came
        here to earn a profit. What useless activities are you attached
        to? Your life-night is coming to its end.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The animals and the birds frolic and play - they do not see
        death. Mankind is also with them, trapped in the net of Maya.
        Those who always remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are
        considered to be liberated.  || 2 ||   That dwelling which you
        will have to abandon and vacate - you are attached to it in
        your mind. And that place where you must go to dwell - you
        have no regard for it at all. Those who fall at the Feet of the
        Guru are released from this bondage.  || 3 ||   No one else can
        save you - don't look for anyone else. I have searched
        in all four directions; I have come to find His Sanctuary. O Nanak,
        the True King has pulled me out and saved me from drowning!  ||
        4 || 3 || 73 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  For a brief moment,
        man is a guest of the Lord; he tries to resolve his affairs. Engrossed
        in Maya and sexual desire, the fool does not understand. He arises
        and departs with regret, and falls into the clutches of the Messenger
        of Death.  || 1 ||   You are sitting on the collapsing riverbank - are
        you blind? If you are so pre-destined, then act according to the
        Guru's Teachings.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Reaper does not
        look upon any as unripe, half-ripe or fully ripe. Picking up and
        wielding their sickles, the harvesters arrive. When the landlord
        gives the order, they cut and measure the crop.  || 2 ||   The
        first watch of the night passes away in worthless affairs, and
        the second passes in deep sleep. In the third, they babble nonsense,
        and when the fourth watch comes, the day of death has arrived.
        The thought of the One who bestows body and soul never enters
        the mind.  || 3 ||   I am devoted to the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy; I sacrifice my soul to them. Through them, understanding
        has entered my mind, and I have met the All-knowing Lord God.
        Nanak sees the Lord always with him - the Lord, the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts.  || 4 || 4 || 74 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Let me forget everything, but let me not forget the One
        Lord. All my evil pursuits have been burnt away; the Guru has
        blessed me with the Naam, the true object of life. Give up all
        other hopes, and rely on the One Hope. Those who serve the True
        Guru receive a place in the world hereafter.  || 1 ||   O my mind,
        praise the Creator. Give up all your clever tricks, and fall at
        the Feet of the Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Pain and hunger shall
        not oppress you, if the Giver of Peace comes into your mind. No
        undertaking shall fail, when the True Lord is always in your heart.
        No one can kill that one unto whom You, Lord, give Your Hand and
        protect. Serve the Guru, the Giver of Peace; He shall wash off
        the residues of all your mistakes.  || 2 ||   Your servant begs
        to serve those who are enjoined to Your service. </p>

      <p> The opportunity to work hard serving the Saadh Sangat is obtained,
        when the Divine Lord is pleased. Everything is in the Hands of
        our Lord and Master; He Himself is the Doer of deeds. I am a sacrifice
        to the True Guru, who fulfills all hopes and desires.  || 3 ||
        The One appears to be my Companion; the One is my Brother and
        Friend. The elements and the components are all made by the One;
        they are held in their order by the One. When the mind accepts,
        and is satisfied with the One, then the consciousness becomes
        steady and stable. Then, one's food is the True Name, one's
        garments are the True Name, and one's Support, O Nanak, is
        the True Name.  || 4 || 5 || 75 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        All things are received if the One is obtained. The precious
        gift of this human life becomes fruitful when one chants the True
        Word of the Shabad. One who has such destiny written on his forehead
        enters the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, through the Guru.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, focus your consciousness on the One. Without
        the One, all entanglements are worthless; emotional attachment
        to Maya is totally false.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Hundreds of thousands
        of princely pleasures are enjoyed, if the True Guru bestows His
        Glance of Grace. If He bestows the Name of the Lord, for even
        a moment, my mind and body are cooled and soothed. Those who have
        such pre-ordained destiny hold tight to the Feet of the True Guru.
        || 2 ||   Fruitful is that moment, and fruitful is that time,
        when one is in love with the True Lord. Suffering and sorrow do
        not touch those who have the Support of the Name of the Lord.
        Grasping him by the arm, the Guru lifts them up and out, and carries
        them across to the other side.  || 3 ||   Embellished and immaculate
        is that place where the Saints gather together. He alone finds
        shelter, who has met the Perfect Guru. Nanak builds his house
        upon that site where there is no death, no birth, and no old age.
        || 4 || 6 || 76 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate on Him,
        O my soul; He is the Supreme Lord over kings and emperors. Place
        the hopes of your mind in the One, in whom all have faith. Give
        up all your clever tricks, and grasp the Feet of the Guru.  ||
        1 ||   O my mind, chant the Name with intuitive peace and poise.
        Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on God. Constantly sing the
        Glories of the Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Seek
        His Shelter, O my mind; there is no other as Great as He. Remembering
        Him in meditation, a profound peace is obtained. Pain and suffering
        will not touch you at all. Forever and ever, work for God; He
        is our True Lord and Master.  || 2 ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, you shall become absolutely pure, and the
        noose of death shall be cut away. So offer your prayers to Him,
        the Giver of Peace, the Destroyer of fear. Showing His Mercy,
        the Merciful Master shall resolve your affairs.  || 3 ||   The
        Lord is said to be the Greatest of the Great; His Kingdom is the
        Highest of the High. He has no color or mark; His Value cannot
        be estimated. Please show Mercy to Nanak, God, and bless him with
        Your True Name.  || 4 || 7 || 77 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        One who meditates on the Naam is at peace; his face is radiant
        and bright. Obtaining it from the Perfect Guru, he is honored
        all over the world. </p>

        the home of the self.  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate on the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har. The Naam is your Companion; it shall always
        be with you. It shall save you in the world hereafter.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||  What good is worldly greatness? All the pleasures
        of Maya are tasteless and insipid. In the end, they shall all
        fade away. Perfectly fulfilled and supremely acclaimed is the
        one, in whose heart the Lord abides.  || 2 ||   Become the dust
        of the Saints; renounce your selfishness and conceit. Give up
        all your schemes and your clever mental tricks, and fall at the
        Feet of the Guru. He alone receives the Jewel, upon whose forehead
        such wondrous destiny is written.  || 3 ||   O Siblings of Destiny,
        it is received only when God Himself bestows it. People serve
        the True Guru only when the fever of egotism has been eradicated.
        Nanak has met the Guru; all his sufferings have come to an end.
        || 4 || 8 || 78 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The One is the
        Knower of all beings; He alone is our Savior. The One is the Support
        of the mind; the One is the Support of the breath of life. In
        His Sanctuary there is eternal peace. He is the Supreme Lord God,
        the Creator.  || 1 ||   O my mind, give up all these efforts.
        Dwell upon the Perfect Guru each day, and attach yourself to the
        One Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One is my Brother, the One
        is my Friend. The One is my Mother and Father. The One is the
        Support of the mind; He has given us body and soul. May I never
        forget God from my mind; He holds all in the Power of His Hands.
        || 2 ||   The One is within the home of the self, and the One
        is outside as well. He Himself is in all places and interspaces.
        Meditate twenty-four hours a day on the One who created all beings
        and creatures. Attuned to the Love of the One, there is no sorrow
        or suffering.  || 3 ||   There is only the One Supreme Lord God;
        there is no other at all. Soul and body all belong to Him; whatever
        pleases His Will comes to pass. Through the Perfect Guru, one
        becomes perfect; O Nanak, meditate on the True One.  || 4 || 9
        || 79 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those who focus their consciousness
        on the True Guru are perfectly fulfilled and famous. Spiritual
        wisdom wells up in the minds of those unto whom the Lord Himself
        shows Mercy. Those who have such destiny written upon their foreheads
        obtain the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate on
        the Name of the One Lord. The happiness of all happiness shall
        well up, and in the Court of the Lord, you shall be dressed in
        robes of honor.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The fear of death and rebirth
        is removed by performing loving devotional service to the Lord
        of the World. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one
        becomes immaculate and pure; the Lord Himself takes care of such
        a one. The filth of birth and death is washed away, and one is
        uplifted, beholding the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.
        || 2 ||   The Supreme Lord God is pervading all places and interspaces.
        The One is the Giver of all - there is no other at all. In
        His Sanctuary, one is saved. Whatever He wishes, comes to pass.
        || 3 ||   Perfectly fulfilled and famous are those, in whose
        minds the Supreme Lord God abides. Their reputation is spotless
        and pure; they are famous all over the world. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on my God.  ||
        4 || 10 || 80 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meeting the True
        Guru, all my sufferings have ended, and the Peace of the Lord
        has come to dwell within my mind. The Divine Light illuminates
        my inner being, and I am lovingly absorbed in the One. Meeting
        with the Holy Saint, my face is radiant; I have realized my pre-ordained
        destiny. I constantly sing the Glories of the Lord of the Universe.
        Through the True Name, I have become spotlessly pure.  || 1 ||
        O my mind, you shall find peace through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. Working for the Perfect Guru, no one goes away empty-handed.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The desires of the mind are fulfilled, when
        the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained. The
        Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is always with you; recognize
        Him as the Creator. By Guru's Grace, your face shall be radiant.
        Chanting the Naam, you shall receive the benefits of giving charity
        and taking cleansing baths. Sexual desire, anger and greed are
        eliminated, and all egotistical pride is abandoned.  || 2 || 
        The Profit of the Naam is obtained, and all affairs are brought
        to fruition. In His Mercy, God unites us with Himself, and He
        blesses us with the Naam. My comings and goings in reincarnation
        have come to an end; He Himself has bestowed His Mercy. I have
        obtained my home in the True Mansion of His Presence, realizing
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 3 ||   His humble devotees
        are protected and saved; He Himself showers His Blessings upon
        us. In this world and in the world hereafter, radiant are the
        faces of those who cherish and enshrine the Glories of the True
        Lord. Twenty-four hours a day, they lovingly dwell upon His Glories;
        they are imbued with His Infinite Love. Nanak is forever a sacrifice
        to the Supreme Lord God, the Ocean of Peace.  || 4 || 11 || 81
        ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  If we meet the Perfect True Guru,
        we obtain the Treasure of the Shabad. Please grant Your Grace,
        God, that we may meditate on Your Ambrosial Naam. The pains of
        birth and death are taken away; we are intuitively centered on
        His Meditation.  || 1 ||   O my mind, seek the Sanctuary of God.
        Without the Lord, there is no other at all. Meditate on the One
        and only Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   His
        Value cannot be estimated; He is the Vast Ocean of Excellence.
        O most fortunate ones, join the Sangat, the Blessed Congregation;
        purchase the True Word of the Shabad. Serve the Lord, the Ocean
        of Peace, the Supreme Lord over kings and emperors.  || 2 || 
        I take the Support of the Lord's Lotus Feet; there is no
        other place of rest for me. I lean upon You as my Support, O Supreme
        Lord God. I exist only by Your Power. O God, You are the Honor
        of the dishonored. I seek to merge with You.  || 3 ||   Chant
        the Lord's Name and contemplate the Lord of the World, twenty-four
        hours a day. He preserves our soul, our breath of life, body and
        wealth. By His Grace, He protects our soul. O Nanak, all pain
        has been washed away, by the Supreme Lord God, the Forgiver. 
        || 4 || 12 || 82 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have fallen
        in love with the True Lord. He does not die, He does not come
        and go. In separation, He is not separated from us; He is pervading
        and permeating amongst all. He is the Destroyer of the pain and
        suffering of the meek. He bears True Love for His servants. Wondrous
        is the Form of the Immaculate One. Through the Guru, I have met
        Him, O my mother!  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny, make God your
        Friend. </p>

      <p> Cursed is emotional attachment and love of Maya; no one is seen
        to be at peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God is Wise, Giving, Tender-hearted,
        Pure, Beautiful and Infinite. He is our Companion and Helper,
        Supremely Great, Lofty and Utterly Infinite. He is not known as
        young or old; His Court is Steady and Stable. Whatever we seek
        from Him, we receive. He is the Support of the unsupported.  ||
        2 ||   Seeing Him, our evil inclinations vanish; mind and body
        become peaceful and tranquil. With one-pointed mind, meditate
        on the One Lord, and the doubts of your mind will be dispelled.
        He is the Treasure of Excellence, the Ever-fresh Being. His Gift
        is Perfect and Complete. Forever and ever, worship and adore Him.
        Day and night, do not forget Him.  || 3 ||   One whose destiny
        is so pre-ordained, obtains the Lord of the Universe as his Companion.
        I dedicate my body, mind, wealth and all to Him. I totally sacrifice
        my soul to Him. Seeing and hearing, He is always close at hand.
        In each and every heart, God is pervading. Even the ungrateful
        ones are cherished by God. O Nanak, He is forever the Forgiver.
        || 4 || 13 || 83 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  This mind, body
        and wealth were given by God, who naturally adorns us. He has
        blessed us with all our energy, and infused His Infinite Light
        deep within us. Forever and ever, meditate in remembrance on God;
        keep Him enshrined in your heart.  || 1 ||   O my mind, without
        the Lord, there is no other at all. Remain in God's Sanctuary
        forever, and no suffering shall afflict you.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   Jewels, treasures, pearls, gold and silver - all these
        are just dust. Mother, father, children and relatives - all
        relations are false. The self-willed manmukh is an insulting beast;
        he does not acknowledge the One who created him.  || 2 ||   The
        Lord is pervading within and beyond, and yet people think that
        He is far away. They are engrossed in clinging desires; within
        their hearts there is ego and falsehood. Without devotion to the
        Naam, crowds of people come and go.  || 3 ||   Please preserve
        Your beings and creatures, God; O Creator Lord, please be merciful!
        Without God, there is no saving grace. The Messenger of Death
        is cruel and unfeeling. O Nanak, may I never forget the Naam!
        Please bless me with Your Mercy, Lord!  || 4 || 14 || 84 ||  
        SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  &quot;My body and my wealth; my ruling
        power, my beautiful form and country - mine!&quot; You may
        have children, a wife and many mistresses; you may enjoy all sorts
        of pleasures and fine clothes. And yet, if the Name of the Lord
        does not abide within the heart, none of it has any use or value.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
        Always keep the Company of the Holy, and focus your consciousness
        on the Feet of the Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who have
        such blessed destiny written on their foreheads meditate on the
        Treasure of the Naam. All their affairs are brought to fruition,
        holding onto the Guru's Feet. The diseases of ego and doubt
        are cast out; they shall not come and go in reincarnation.  ||
        2 ||   Let the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, be your
        cleansing baths at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
        Your soul, breath of life, mind and body shall blossom forth in

        God Himself acts, and causes others to act; everything is in
        His Hands. He Himself bestows life and death; He is with us, within
        and beyond. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the Master of all
        hearts.  || 4 || 15 || 85 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Guru
        is Merciful; we seek the Sanctuary of God. Through the Teachings
        of the True Guru, all worldly entanglements are eliminated. The
        Name of the Lord is firmly implanted within my mind; through His
        Ambrosial Glance of Grace, I am exalted and enraptured.  || 1
        ||   O my mind, serve the True Guru. God Himself grants His Grace;
        do not forget Him, even for an instant.  ||  Pause  ||   Continually
        sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the Destroyer
        of demerits. Without the Name of the Lord, there is no peace.
        Having tried all sorts of ostentatious displays, I have come to
        see this. Intuitively imbued with His Praises, one is saved, crossing
        over the terrifying world-ocean.  || 2 ||   The merits of pilgrimages,
        fasts and hundreds of thousands of techniques of austere self-discipline
        are found in the dust of the feet of the Holy. From whom are you
        trying to hide your actions? God sees all; He is Ever-present.
        My God is totally pervading all places and interspaces.  || 3
        ||   True is His Empire, and True is His Command. True is His
        Seat of True Authority. True is the Creative Power which He has
        created. True is the world which He has fashioned. O Nanak, chant
        the True Name; I am forever and ever a sacrifice to Him.  || 4
        || 16 || 86 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Make the effort, and

        In the Society of the Saints, meditate in remembrance on the Lord,
        and wash off the filth of countless incarnations.  || 1 ||   O
        my mind, chant and meditate on the Name of the Lord. Enjoy the
        fruits of your mind's desires; all suffering and sorrow shall
        depart.  ||  Pause  ||   For His sake, you assumed this body;
        see God always with you. God is pervading the water, the land
        and the sky; He sees all with His Glance of Grace.  || 2 ||  
        The mind and body become spotlessly pure, enshrining love for
        the True Lord. One who dwells upon the Feet of the Supreme Lord
        God has truly performed all meditations and austerities.  || 3
        ||   The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is a Gem, a Jewel, a Pearl.
        The essence of intuitive peace and bliss is obtained, O servant
        Nanak, by singing the Glories of God.  || 4 || 17 || 87 ||   SIREE
        RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  That is the essence of the scriptures, and

        Lord. The Guru has given me the Wealth of the Lotus Feet of the
        Lord, and I, without shelter, have now obtained Shelter. The True
        Capital, and the True Way of Life, comes by chanting His Glories,
        twenty-four hours a day. Granting His Grace, God meets us, and
        we no longer die, or come or go in reincarnation.  || 1 ||   O
        my mind, vibrate and meditate forever on the Lord, with single-minded
        love. He is contained deep within each and every heart. He is
        always with you, as your Helper and Support.  || 1 ||  Pause

        world - without our Husband Lord, there is no other place of
        rest.  || 2 ||   Offer your prayers to Him, who shall unite you

        I have searched and looked throughout the entire universe. The

        Lord; in the world beyond, in your in-laws' home, you shall
        dwell in peace. Meeting with the Guru, be a sincere student of
        proper conduct, and suffering shall never touch you.  || 3 ||
        Everyone shall go to their Husband Lord. </p>

      <p> Everyone shall be given their ceremonial send-off after their
        marriage. O Nanak, blessed are the happy soul-brides, who are
        in love with their Husband Lord.  || 4 || 23 || 93 ||   SIREE
        RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL,  SIXTH HOUSE:  The One Lord is the Doer, the
        Cause of causes, who has created the creation. Meditate on the
        One, O my mind, who is the Support of all.  || 1 ||   Meditate
        within your mind on the Guru's Feet. Give up all your clever
        mental tricks, and lovingly attune yourself to the True Word of
        the Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Suffering, agony and fear do
        not cling to one whose heart is filled with the GurMantra. Trying
        millions of things, people have grown weary, but without the Guru,
        none have been saved.  || 2 ||   Gazing upon the Blessed Vision
        of the Guru's Darshan, the mind is comforted and all sins
        depart. I am a sacrifice to those who fall at the Feet of the
        Guru.  || 3 ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        the True Name of the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. Very fortunate
        are those, O Nanak, whose minds are filled with this love.  ||
        4 || 24 || 94 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Gather in the Wealth
        of the Lord, worship the True Guru, and give up all your corrupt
        ways. Meditate in remembrance on the Lord who created and adorned
        you, and you shall be saved.  || 1 ||   O mind, chant the Name
        of the One, the Unique and Infinite Lord. He gave you the praanaa,
        the breath of life, and your mind and body. He is the Support
        of the heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The world is drunk, engrossed
        in sexual desire, anger and egotism. Seek the Sanctuary of the
        Saints, and fall at their feet; your suffering and darkness shall
        be removed.  || 2 ||   Practice truth, contentment and kindness;
        this is the most excellent way of life. One who is so blessed
        by the Formless Lord God renounces selfishness, and becomes the
        dust of all.  || 3 ||   All that is seen is You, Lord, the expansion
        of the expanse. Says Nanak, the Guru has removed my doubts; I
        recognize God in all.  || 4 || 25 || 95 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The whole world is engrossed in bad deeds and good deeds.
        God's devotee is above both, but those who understand this
        are very rare.  || 1 ||   Our Lord and Master is all-pervading
        everywhere. What should I say, and what should I hear? O my Lord
        and Master, You are Great, All-powerful and All-knowing.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   One who is influenced by praise and blame is not
        God's servant. One who sees the essence of reality with impartial
        vision, O Saints, is very rare - one among millions.  || 2
        ||   People talk on and on about Him; they consider this to be
        praise of God. But rare indeed is the Gurmukh, who is above this
        mere talk.  || 3 ||   He is not concerned with deliverance or
        bondage. Nanak has obtained the gift of the dust of the feet of
        the Saints.  || 4 || 26 || 96 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL,  SEVENTH
        HOUSE:  Relying on Your Mercy, Dear Lord, I have indulged in sensual
        pleasures. Like a foolish child, I have made mistakes. O Lord,
        You are my Father and Mother.  || 1 ||   It is easy to speak and
        talk, but it is difficult to accept Your Will.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I stand tall; You are my Strength. I know that You are mine.
        Inside of all, and outside of all, You are our Self-sufficient
        Father.  || 2 ||   O Father, I do not know - how can I know
        Your Way? </p>

      <p> He frees us from bondage, O Saints, and saves us from possessiveness.
        || 3 ||   Becoming Merciful, my Lord and Master has ended my
        comings and goings in reincarnation. Meeting with the Guru, Nanak
        has recognized the Supreme Lord God.  || 4 || 27 || 97 ||   SIREE
        RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:  Meeting with the humble beings,
        O Siblings of Destiny, the Messenger of Death is conquered. The
        True Lord and Master has come to dwell within my mind; my Lord
        and Master has become Merciful. Meeting with the Perfect True
        Guru, all my worldly entanglements have ended.  || 1 ||   O my
        True Guru, I am a sacrifice to You. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed
        Vision of Your Darshan. By the Pleasure of Your Will, You have
        blessed me with the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who have served You with love are truly
        wise. Those who have the Treasure of the Naam within emancipate
        others as well as themselves. There is no other Giver as great
        as the Guru, who has given the gift of the soul.  || 2 ||   Blessed
        and acclaimed is the coming of those who have met the Guru with
        loving faith. Attuned to the True One, you shall obtain a place
        of honor in the Court of the Lord. Greatness is in the Hands of
        the Creator; it is obtained by pre-ordained destiny.  || 3 ||
        True is the Creator, True is the Doer. True is our Lord and
        Master, and True is His Support. So speak the Truest of the True.
        Through the True One, an intuitive and discerning mind is obtained.
        Nanak lives by chanting and meditating on the One, who is pervading
        within and contained amongst all.  || 4 || 28 || 98 ||   SIREE
        RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Worship the Guru, the Transcendent Lord, with
        your mind and body attuned to love. The True Guru is the Giver
        of the soul; He gives Support to all. Act according to the Instructions
        of the True Guru; this is the true philosophy. Without being attuned
        to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all attachment to
        Maya is just dust.  || 1 ||   O my friend, reflect upon the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har. In the Saadh Sangat, He dwells within the
        mind, and one's works are brought to perfect fruition.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Guru is All-powerful, the Guru is Infinite.
        By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is obtained.
        The Guru is Imperceptible, Immaculate and Pure. There is no other
        as great as the Guru. The Guru is the Creator, the Guru is the
        Doer. The Gurmukh obtains true glory. Nothing is beyond the Guru;
        whatever He wishes comes to pass.  || 2 ||   The Guru is the Sacred
        Shrine of Pilgrimage, the Guru is the Wish-fulfilling Elysian
        Tree. The Guru is the Fulfiller of the desires of the mind. The
        Guru is the Giver of the Name of the Lord, by which all the world
        is saved. The Guru is All-powerful, the Guru is Formless; the
        Guru is Lofty, Inaccessible and Infinite. The Praise of the Guru
        is so sublime - what can any speaker say?  || 3 ||   All the
        rewards which the mind desires are with the True Guru. One whose
        destiny is so pre-ordained, obtains the Wealth of the True Name.
        Entering the Sanctuary of the True Guru, you shall never die again.
        Nanak: may I never forget You, Lord. This soul, body and breath
        are Yours.  || 4 || 29 || 99 ||   SIREE RAAG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O
        Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, listen: release comes only through
        the True Name. Worship the Feet of the Guru. Let the Name of the
        Lord be your sacred shrine of pilgrimage. </p>

      <p> Hereafter, you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord; there,
        even the homeless find a home.  || 1 ||   O Siblings of Destiny,
        service to the True Guru alone is True. When the True Guru is
        pleased, we obtain the Perfect, Unseen, Unknowable Lord.  || 1
        || Pause  ||   I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has bestowed
        the True Name. Night and day, I praise the True One; I sing the
        Glorious Praises of the True One. True is the food, and true are
        the clothes, of those who chant the True Name of the True One.
        || 2 ||   With each breath and morsel of food, do not forget
        the Guru, the Embodiment of Fulfillment. None is seen to be as
        great as the Guru. Meditate on Him twenty-four hours a day. As
        He casts His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name, the Treasure
        of Excellence.  || 3 ||   The Guru and the Transcendent Lord are
        one and the same, pervading and permeating amongst all. Those
        who have such pre-ordained destiny, meditate on the Naam. Nanak
        seeks the Sanctuary of the Guru, who does not die, or come and
        go in reincarnation.  || 4 || 30 || 100 || </p>

        ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE
        TRUE GURU:
        <p> SIREE RAAG,  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  ASHTAPADEES:</p>
      </center>
      <p> I speak and chant His Praises, vibrating the instrument of my
        mind. The more I know Him, the more I vibrate it. The One, unto
        whom we vibrate and sing - how great is He, and where is His
        Place? Those who speak of Him and praise Him - they all continue
        speaking of Him with love.  || 1 ||   O Baba, the Lord Allah is
        Inaccessible and Infinite. Sacred is His Name, and Sacred is His
        Place. He is the True Cherisher.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The extent
        of Your Command cannot be seen; no one knows how to write it.
        Even if a hundred poets met together, they could not describe
        even a tiny bit of it. No one has found Your Value; they all merely
        write what they have heard again and again.  || 2 ||   The Pirs,
        the Prophets, the spiritual teachers, the faithful, the innocents
        and the martyrs, the Shaikhs, the mystics, the Qazis, the Mullahs
        and the Dervishes at His Door - they are blessed all the more
        as they continue reading their prayers in praise to Him.  || 3
        ||   He seeks no advice when He builds; He seeks no advice when
        He destroys. He seeks no advice while giving or taking. He alone
        knows His Creative Power; He Himself does all deeds. He beholds
        all in His Vision. He gives to those with whom He is pleased.
        || 4 ||   His Place and His Name are not known, no one knows
        how great is His Name. How great is that place where my Sovereign
        Lord dwells? No one can reach it; whom shall I go and ask?  ||
        5 ||   One class of people does not like the other, when one has
        been made great. Greatness is only in His Great Hands; He gives
        to those with whom He is pleased. By the Hukam of His Command,
        He Himself regenerates, without a moment's delay.  || 6 ||
        Everyone cries out, &quot;More! More!&quot;, with the idea of
        receiving. How great should we call the Giver? His Gifts are beyond
        estimation. O Nanak, there is no deficiency; Your Storehouses
        are filled to overflowing, age after age.  || 7 || 1 ||   FIRST
        MEHL:  All are brides of the Husband Lord; all decorate themselves
        for Him. <br>
