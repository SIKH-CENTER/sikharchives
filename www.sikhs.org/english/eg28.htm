      <p> The truthful Sikhs sit by the True Guru's side and serve
        Him. The false ones search, but find no place of rest. Those who
        are not pleased with the Words of the True Guru  -  their faces
        are cursed, and they wander around, condemned by God. Those who
        do not have the Love of the Lord within their hearts  -  how
        long can those demonic, self-willed manmukhs be consoled? One
        who meets the True Guru, keeps his mind in its own place; he spends
        only his own assets. O servant Nanak, some are united with the
        Guru; to some, the Lord grants peace, while others  -  deceitful
        cheats  -  suffer in isolation.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Those
        who have the treasure of the Lord's Name deep within their
        hearts  -  the Lord resolves their affairs. They are no longer
        subservient to other people; the Lord God sits by them, at their
        side. When the Creator is on their side, then everyone is on their
        side. Beholding their vision, everyone applauds them. Kings and
        emperors are all created by the Lord; they all come and bow in
        reverence to the Lord's humble servant. Great is the greatness
        of the Perfect Guru. Serving the Great Lord, I have obtained immeasurable
        peace. The Lord has bestowed this eternal gift upon the Perfect
        Guru; His blessings increase day by day. The slanderer, who cannot
        endure His greatness, is destroyed by the Creator Himself. Servant
        Nanak chants the Glorious Praises of the Creator, who protects
        His devotees forever.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You, O Lord and Master,
        are inaccessible and merciful; You are the Great Giver, All-knowing.
        I can see no other as great as You; O Lord of Wisdom, You are
        pleasing to my mind. Emotional attachment to your family and everything
        you see is temporary, coming and going. Those who attach their
        consciousness to anything except the True Lord are false, and
        false is their pride. O Nanak, meditate on the True Lord; without
        the True Lord, the ignorant rot away and putrefy to death.  ||
        10 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  At first, he did not show respect
        to the Guru; later, he offered excuses, but it is no use. The
        wretched, self-willed manmukhs wander around and are stuck mid-way;
        how can they find peace by mere words? Those who have no love
        for the True Guru within their hearts come with falsehood, and
        leave with falsehood. When my Lord God, the Creator, grants His
        Grace, then they come to see the True Guru as the Supreme Lord
        God. Then, they drink in the Nectar, the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad; all burning, anxiety, and doubts are eliminated. They
        remain in ecstasy forever, day and night; O servant Nanak, they
        sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day.  || 1 ||
        FOURTH MEHL:  One who calls himself a Sikh of the Guru, the
        True Guru, shall rise in the early morning hours and meditate
        on the Lord's Name. Upon arising early in the morning, he
        is to bathe, and cleanse himself in the pool of nectar. Following
        the Instructions of the Guru, he is to chant the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har. All sins, misdeeds and negativity shall be erased. Then,
        at the rising of the sun, he is to sing Gurbani; whether sitting
        down or standing up, he is to meditate on the Lord's Name.
        One who meditates on my Lord, Har, Har, with every breath and
        every morsel of food  -  that GurSikh becomes pleasing to the
        Guru's Mind. </p>

      </p>
      <p> That person, unto whom my Lord and Master is kind and compassionate
        -  upon that GurSikh, the Guru's Teachings are bestowed.
        Servant Nanak begs for the dust of the feet of that GurSikh, who
        himself chants the Naam, and inspires others to chant it.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who meditate on You, O True Lord  - 
        they are very rare. Those who worship and adore the One Lord in
        their conscious minds  -  through their generosity, countless
        millions are fed. All meditate on You, but they alone are accepted,
        who are pleasing to their Lord and Master. Those who eat and dress
        without serving the True Guru die; after death, those wretched
        lepers are consigned to reincarnation. In His Sublime Presence,
        they talk sweetly, but behind His back, they exude poison from
        their mouths. The evil-minded are consigned to separation from
        the Lord.  || 11 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  The faithless baymukh
        sent out his faithless servant, wearing a blue-black coat, filled
        with filth and vermin. No one in the world will sit near him;
        the self-willed manmukh fell into manure, and returned with even
        more filth covering him. The faithless baymukh was sent to slander
        and back-bite others, but when he went there, the faces of both
        he and his faithless master were blackened instead. It was immediately
        heard throughout the whole world, O Siblings of Destiny, that
        this faithless man, along with his servant, was kicked and beaten
        with shoes; in humiliation, they got up and returned to their
        homes. The faithless baymukh was not allowed to mingle with others;
        his wife and niece then brought him home to lie down. He has lost
        both this world and the next; he cries out continually, in hunger
        and thirst. Blessed, blessed is the Creator, the Primal Being,
        our Lord and Master; He Himself sits and dispenses true justice.
        One who slanders the Perfect True Guru is punished and destroyed
        by the True Lord. This Word is spoken by the One who created the
        whole universe.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  One who has a poor beggar
        for a master  -  how can he be well-fed? If there is something
        in his master's house, he can get it; but how can he get
        what is not there? Serving him, who will be called to answer for
        his account? That service is painful and useless. O Nanak, serve
        the Guru, the Lord Incarnate; the Blessed Vision of His Darshan
        is profitable, and in the end, you shall not be called to account.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O Nanak, the Saints consider, and the four
        Vedas proclaim, that whatever the Lord's devotees utter with
        their mouths, shall come to pass. He is manifest in His cosmic
        workshop. All people hear of this. The stubborn men who fight
        with the Saints shall never find peace. The Saints seek to bless
        them with virtue, but they only burn in their egos. What can those
        wretched ones do, since, from the very beginning, their destiny
        is cursed with evil. Those who are struck down by the Supreme
        Lord God are of no use to anyone. Those who hate the One who has
        no hatred  -  according to the true justice of Dharma, they
        shall perish. Those who are cursed by the Saints will continue
        wandering aimlessly. When the tree is cut off at its roots, the
        branches wither and die.  || 12 ||   SHALOK  FOURTH MEHL: </p>

      <p> Great is the greatness of the Guru, who meditates on the Lord
        within. By His Pleasure, the Lord has bestowed this upon the Perfect
        True Guru; it is not diminished one bit by anyone's efforts.
        The True Lord and Master is on the side of the True Guru; and
        so, all those who oppose Him waste away to death in anger, envy
        and conflict. The Lord, the Creator, blackens the faces of the
        slanderers, and increases the glory of the Guru. As the slanderers
        spread their slander, so does the Guru's glory increase day
        by day. Servant Nanak worships the Lord, who makes everyone fall
        at His Feet.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  One who enters into a calculated
        relationship with the True Guru loses everything, this world and
        the next. He grinds his teeth continually and foams at the mouth;
        screaming in anger, he perishes. He continually chases after Maya
        and wealth, but even his own wealth flies away. What shall he
        earn, and what shall he eat? Within his heart, there is only cynicism
        and pain. One who hates the One who has no hatred, shall bear
        the load of all the sins of the world on his head. He shall find
        no shelter here or hereafter; his mouth blisters with the slander
        in his heart. If gold comes into his hands, it turns to dust.
        But if he should come again to the Sanctuary of the Guru, then
        even his past sins shall be forgiven. Servant Nanak meditates
        on the Naam, night and day. Remembering the Lord in meditation,
        wickedness and sins are erased.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  You are the
        Truest of the True; Your Regal Court is the most exalted of all.
        Those who meditate on You, O True Lord, serve the Truth; O True
        Lord, they take pride in You. Within them is the Truth; their
        faces are radiant, and they speak the Truth. O True Lord, You
        are their strength. Those who, as Gurmukh, praise You are Your
        devotees; they have the insignia and the banner of the Shabad,
        the True Word of God. I am truly a sacrifice, forever devoted
        to those who serve the True Lord.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  Those who were cursed by the Perfect True Guru, from the
        very beginning, are even now cursed by the True Guru. Even though
        they may have a great longing to associate with the Guru, the
        Creator does not allow it. They shall not find shelter in the
        Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; in the Sangat, the Guru has
        proclaimed this. Whoever goes out to meet them now, will be destroyed
        by the tyrant, the Messenger of Death. Those who were condemned
        by Guru Nanak were declared counterfeit by Guru Angad as well.
        The Guru of the third generation thought, &quot;What lies in the
        hands of these poor people?&quot; The Guru of the fourth generation
        saved all these slanderers and evil-doers. If any son or Sikh
        serves the True Guru, then all of his affairs will be resolved.
        He obtains the fruits of his desires  -  children, wealth,
        property, union with the Lord and emancipation. All treasures
        are in the True Guru, who has enshrined the Lord within the heart.
        He alone obtains the Perfect True Guru, on whose forehead such
        blessed destiny is pre-ordained. Servant Nanak begs for the dust
        of the feet of those GurSikhs who love the Lord, their Friend. </p>

      <p> || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord Himself bestows glorious greatness;
        He Himself causes the world to come and fall at their feet. We
        should only be afraid, if we try to do things by ourselves; the
        Creator is increasing His Power in every way. Behold, O Siblings
        of Destiny: this is the Arena of the Beloved True Lord; His power
        brings everyone to bow in humility. The Lord, our Lord and Master,
        preserves and protects His devotees; He blackens the faces of
        the slanderers and evil-doers. The glorious greatness of the True
        Guru increases day by day; the Lord inspires His devotees to continually
        sing the Kirtan of His Praises. O GurSikhs, chant the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, night and day; through the True Guru, the Creator
        Lord will come to dwell within the home of your inner being. O
        GurSikhs, know that the Bani, the Word of the True Guru, is true,
        absolutely true. The Creator Lord Himself causes the Guru to chant
        it. The Beloved Lord makes the faces of His GurSikhs radiant;
        He makes the whole world applaud and acclaim the Guru. Servant
        Nanak is the slave of the Lord; the Lord Himself preserves the
        honor of His slave.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O My True Lord and Master,
        You Yourself are my True Lord King. Please, implant within me
        the true treasure of Your Name; O God, I am Your merchant. I serve
        the True One, and deal in the True One; I chant Your Wondrous
        Praises. Those humble beings who serve the Lord with love meet
        Him; they are adorned with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        O my True Lord and Master, You are unknowable; through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, You are known.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,
        FOURTH MEHL:  One whose heart is filled with jealousy of others,
        never comes to any good. No one pays any attention to what he
        says; he is just a fool, crying out endlessly in the wilderness.
        One whose heart is filled with malicious gossip, is known as a
        malicious gossip; everything he does is in vain. Night and day,
        he continually gossips about others; his face has been blackened,
        and he cannot show it to anyone. The body is the field of action,
        in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; as you plant, so shall you harvest.
        Justice is not passed on mere words; if someone eats poison, he
        dies. O Siblings of Destiny, behold the justice of the True Creator;
        as people act, so they are rewarded. The Lord has bestowed total
        understanding upon servant Nanak; he speaks and proclaims the
        words of the Lord's Court.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Those
        who separate themselves from the Guru, in spite of His Constant
        Presence  -  they find no place of rest in the Court of the
        Lord. If someone goes to meet with those dull-faced slanderers,
        he will find their faces covered with spit. Those who are cursed
        by the True Guru, are cursed by all the world. They wander around
        endlessly. Those who do not publicly affirm their Guru wander
        around, moaning and groaning. Their hunger shall never depart;
        afflicted by constant hunger, they cry out in pain. No one hears
        what they have to say; they live in constant fear and terror,
        until they finally die. They cannot bear the glorious greatness
        of the True Guru, and they find no place of rest, here or hereafter. </p>

      <p> Those who go out to meet with those who have been cursed by the
        True Guru, lose all remnants of their honor. They have already
        become like lepers; cursed by the Guru, whoever meets them is
        also afflicted with leprosy. O Lord, I pray that I may not even
        catch sight of those, who focus their consciousness on the love
        of duality. That which the Creator pre-ordained from the very
        beginning  -  there can be no escape from that. O servant Nanak,
        worship and adore the Naam, the Name of the Lord; no one can equal
        it. Great is the greatness of His Name; it increases, day by day.
        || 2 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Great is the greatness of that humble
        being, whom the Guru Himself anointed in His Presence. All the
        world comes and bows to him, falling at his feet. His praises
        spread throughout the world. The galaxies and solar systems bow
        in reverence to him; the Perfect Guru has placed His hand upon
        his head, and he has become perfect. The glorious greatness of
        the Guru increases day by day; no one can equal it. O servant
        Nanak, the Creator Lord Himself established him; God preserves
        his honor.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  The human body is a great fortress,
        with its shops and streets within. The Gurmukh who comes to trade
        gathers the cargo of the Lord's Name. He deals in the treasure
        of the Lord's Name, the jewels and the diamonds. Those who
        search for this treasure outside of the body, in other places,
        are foolish demons. They wander around in the wilderness of doubt,
        like the deer who searches for the musk in the bushes.  || 15
        ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  One who slanders the Perfect True
        Guru, shall have difficulty in this world. He is caught and thrown
        into the most horrible hell, the well of pain and suffering. No
        one listens to his shrieks and cries; he cries out in pain and
        misery. He totally loses this world and the next; he has lost
        all of his investment and profit. He is like the ox at the oil-press;
        each morning when he rises, God places the yoke upon him. The
        Lord always sees and hears everything; nothing can be concealed
        from Him. As you plant, so shall you harvest, according to what
        you planted in the past. One who is blessed by God's Grace
        washes the feet of the True Guru. He is carried across by the
        Guru, the True Guru, like iron which is carried across by wood.
        O servant Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; chanting
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, peace is obtained.  || 1 ||  
        FOURTH MEHL:  Very fortunate is the soul-bride, who, as Gurmukh,
        meets the Lord, her King. Her inner being is illiminated with
        His Divine Light; O Nanak, she is absorbed in His Name.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  This body is the home of Dharma; the Divine Light
        of the True Lord is within it. Hidden within it are the jewels
        of mystery; how rare is that Gurmukh, that selfless servant, who
        digs them out. When someone realizes the All-pervading Soul, then
        he sees the One and Only Lord permeating, through and through.
        He sees the One, he believes in the One, and with his ears, he
        listens only to the One. </p>

      <p> O servant Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; this is
        your service to the Lord, the Truest of the True.  || 16 ||  
        SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  All joy is in the hearts of those, within
        whose minds the Lord abides. In the Court of the Lord, their faces
        are radiant, and everyone goes to see them. Those who meditate
        on the Name of the Fearless Lord have no fear. Those who have
        such pre-destined destiny remember the Sublime Lord. Those, within
        whose minds the Lord abides, are robed with honor in the Court
        of the Lord. They are carried across, along with all their family,
        and the whole world is saved along with them. O Lord, please unite
        servant Nanak with Your humble servants; beholding them, beholding
        them, I live.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  That land, where my True
        Guru comes and sits, becomes green and fertile. Those beings who
        go and behold my True Guru are rejuvenated. Blessed, blessed is
        the father; blessed, blessed is the family; blessed, blessed is
        the mother, who gave birth to the Guru. Blessed, blessed is the
        Guru, who worships and adores the Naam; He saves Himself, and
        emancipates those who see Him. O Lord, be kind, and unite me with
        the True Guru, that servant Nanak may wash His feet.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  Truest of the True is the Immortal True Guru; He has
        enshrined the Lord deep within His heart. Truest of the True is
        the True Guru, the Primal Being, who has conquered sexual desire,
        anger and corruption. When I see the Perfect True Guru, then deep
        within, my mind is comforted and consoled. I am a sacrifice to
        my True Guru; I am devoted and dedicated to Him, forever and ever.
        || 17 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  By His Grace, He leads us to
        meet the True Guru; then, as Gurmukh, we chant the Lord's
        Name, and meditate on it. We do that which pleases the True Guru;
        the Perfect Guru comes to dwell in the home of the heart. Those
        who have the treasure of the Naam deep within  -  all their
        fears are removed. They are protected by the Lord Himself; others
        struggle and fight against them, but they only come to death.
        O servant Nanak, meditate on the Naam; the Lord shall deliver
        you, here and hereafter.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The glorious
        greatness of the Guru, the True Guru, is pleasing to the GurSikh's
        mind. The Lord preserves the honor of the True Guru, which increases
        day by day. The Supreme Lord God is in the Mind of the Guru, the
        True Guru; the Supreme Lord God saves Him. The Lord is the Power
        and Support of the Guru, the True Guru; all come to bow before
        Him. Those who have gazed lovingly upon my True Guru  -  all
        their sins are taken away. Their faces are radiant in the Court
        of the Lord, and they obtain great glory. Servant Nanak begs for
        the dust of the feet of those GurSikhs, O my Siblings of Destiny.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  I chant the Praises and Glories of the True
        One. True is the glorious greatness of the True Lord. I praise
        the True Lord, and the Praises of the True Lord. </p>

      <p> His worth cannot be estimated. Those who have tasted the true
        essence of the True Lord, remain satisfied and fulfilled. They
        know this essence of the Lord, but they say nothing, like the
        mute who tastes the sweet candy, and says nothing. The Perfect
        Guru serves the Lord God; His vibration vibrates and resounds
        in the mind.  || 18 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  Those who have
        a festering boil within  -  they alone know its pain. Those
        who know the pain of separation from the Lord  -  I am forever
        a sacrifice, a sacrifice to them. O Lord, please lead me to meet
        the Guru, the Primal Being, my Friend; my head shall roll in the
        dust under His feet. I am the slave of the slaves of those GurSikhs
        who serve Him. Those who are imbued with the deep crimson color
        of the Lord's Love  -  their robes are drenched in the
        Love of the Lord. Grant Your Grace, and lead Nanak to meet the
        Guru; I have sold my head to Him.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The
        body is full of mistakes and misdeeds; how can it become pure,
        O Saints? The Gurmukh purchases virtues, which wash off the sin
        of egotism. True is the trade which purchases the True Lord with
        love. No loss will come from this, and the profit comes by the
        Lord's Will. O Nanak, they alone purchase the Truth, who
        are blessed with such pre-ordained destiny.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        I praise the True One, who alone is worthy of praise. The True
        Primal Being is True  -  this is His unique quality. Serving
        the True Lord, the Truth comes to dwell in the mind. The Lord,
        the Truest of the True, is my Protector. Those who worship and
        adore the Truest of the True, shall go and merge with the True
        Lord. Those who do not serve the Truest of the True  -  those
        self-willed manmukhs are foolish demons. With their mouths, they
        babble on about this and that, like the drunkard who has drunk
        his wine.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Gauree Raga is auspicious,
        if, through it, one comes to think of his Lord and Master. He
        should walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru; this should
        be his decoration. The True Word of the Shabad is our spouse;
        ravish and enjoy it, forever and ever. Like the deep crimson color
        of the madder plant  -  such is the dye which shall color you,
        when you dedicate your soul to the True One. One who loves the
        True Lord is totally imbued with the Lord's Love, like the
        deep crimson color of the poppy. Falsehood and deception may be
        covered with false coatings, but they cannot remain hidden. False
        is the uttering of praises, by those who love falsehood. O Nanak,
        He alone is True; He Himself casts His Glance of Grace.  || 1
        ||   FOURTH MEHL:  In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the
        Lord's Praises are sung. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, the Beloved Lord is met. Blessed is that mortal being,
        who shares the Teachings for the good of others. He implants the
        Name of the Lord, and he preaches the Name of the Lord; through
        the Name of the Lord, the world is saved. Everyone longs to see
        the Guru; the world, and the nine continents, bow down to Him.
        You Yourself have established the True Guru; You Yourself have
        adorned the Guru. You Yourself worship and adore the True Guru;
        You inspire others to worship Him as well, O Creator Lord. </p>

      <p> If someone separates himself from the True Guru, his face is blackened,
        and he is destroyed by the Messenger of Death. He shall find no
        shelter, here or hereafter; the GurSikhs have realized this in
        their minds. That humble being who meets the True Guru is saved;
        he cherishes the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in his heart. Servant
        Nanak says: O GurSikhs, O my sons, meditate on the Lord; only
        the Lord shall save you.  || 2 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Egotism has led
        the world astray, along with evil-mindedness and the poison of
        corruption. Meeting with the True Guru, we are blessed by the
        Lord's Glance of Grace, while the self-willed manmukh gropes
        around in the darkness. O Nanak, the Lord absorbs into Himself
        those whom He inspires to love the Word of His Shabad.  || 3 ||
        PAUREE:  True are the Praises and the Glories of the True One;
        he alone speaks them, whose mind is softened within. Those who
        worship the One Lord with single-minded devotion  -  their
        bodies shall never perish. Blessed, blessed and acclaimed is that
        person, who tastes with his tongue the Ambrosial Nectar of the
        True Name. One whose mind is pleased with the Truest of the True
        is accepted in the True Court. Blessed, blessed is the birth of
        those true beings; the True Lord brightens their faces.  || 20
        ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  The faithless cynics go and bow before
        the Guru, but their minds are corrupt and false, totally false.
        When the Guru says, &quot;Rise up, my Siblings of Destiny&quot;,
        they sit down, crowded in like cranes. The True Guru prevails
        among His GurSikhs; they pick out and expel the wanderers. Sitting
        here and there, they hide their faces; being counterfeit, they
        cannot mix with the genuine. There is no food for them there;
        the false go into the filth like sheep. If you try to feed the
        faithless cynic, he will spit out poison from his mouth. O Lord,
        let me not be in the company of the faithless cynic, who is cursed
        by the Creator Lord. This drama belongs to the Lord; He performs
        it, and He watches over it. Servant Nanak cherishes the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The True Guru,
        the Primal Being, is inaccessible; He has enshrined the Lord's
        Name within His heart. No one can equal the True Guru; the Creator
        Lord is on His side. Devotional worship of the Lord is the sword
        and armor of the True Guru; He has killed and cast out Death,
        the torturer. The Lord Himself is the Protector of the True Guru.
        The Lord saves all those who follow in the footsteps of the True
        Guru. One who thinks evil of the Perfect True Guru  -  the
        Creator Lord Himself destroys him. These words will be confirmed
        as true in the Court of the Lord; servant Nanak reveals this mystery.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who dwell upon the True Lord while asleep,
        utter the True Name when they are awake. How rare in the world
        are those Gurmukhs who dwell upon the True Lord. I am a sacrifice
        to those who chant the True Name, night and day. The True Lord
        is pleasing to their minds and bodies; they go to the Court of
        the True Lord. Servant Nanak chants the True Name; truly, the
        True Lord is forever brand new.  || 21 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:
        Who is asleep, and who is awake? Those who are Gurmukh are approved. </p>

      <p> Those who do not forget the Lord, with each and every breath and
        morsel of food, are the perfect and famous persons. By His Grace
        they find the True Guru; night and day, they meditate. I join
        the society of those persons, and in so doing, I am honored in
        the Court of the Lord. While asleep, they chant, &quot;Waaho!
        Waaho!&quot;, and while awake, they chant, &quot;Waaho!&quot;
        as well. O Nanak, radiant are the faces of those, who rise up
        early each day, and dwell upon the Lord.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:
        Serving his True Guru, one obtains the Naam, the Name of the
        Infinite Lord. The drowning person is lifted up and out of the
        terrifying world-ocean; the Great Giver gives the gift of the
        Lord's Name. Blessed, blessed are those bankers who trade
        the Naam. The Sikhs, the traders come, and through the Word of
        His Shabad, they are carried across. O servant Nanak, they alone
        serve the Creator Lord, who are blessed by His Grace.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  Those who truly worship and adore the True Lord, are
        truly the humble devotees of the True Lord. Those Gurmukhs who
        search and seek, find the True One within themselves. Those who
        truly serve their True Lord and Master, overwhelm and conquer
        Death, the torturer. The True One is truly the greatest of all;
        those who serve the True One are blended with the True One. Blessed
        and acclaimed is the Truest of the True; serving the Truest of
        the True, one blossoms forth in fruition.  || 22  ||   SHALOK,
        FOURTH MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh is foolish; he wanders
        around without the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Without the Guru,
        his mind is not held steady, and he is reincarnated, over and
        over again. But when the Lord God Himself becomes merciful to
        him, then the True Guru comes to meet him. O servant Nanak, praise
        the Naam; the pains of birth and death shall come to an end. 
        || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  I praise my Guru in so many ways, with
        joyful love and affection. My mind is imbued with the True Guru;
        He has preserved the make of its making. My tongue is not satisfied
        by praising Him; He has linked my consciousness with the Lord,
        my Beloved. O Nanak, my mind hungers for the Name of the Lord;
        my mind is satisfied, tasting the sublime essence of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The True Lord is truly known for His all-powerful
        creative nature; He fashioned the days and the nights. I praise
        that True Lord, forever and ever; True is the glorious greatness
        of the True Lord. True are the Praises of the Praiseworthy True
        Lord; the value of the True Lord cannot be appraised. When someone
        meets the Perfect True Guru, then His Sublime Presence comes to
        be seen. Those Gurmukhs who praise the True Lord  -  all their
        hunger is gone.  || 23 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  Searching and
        examining my mind and body, I have found that God, whom I longed
        for. I have found the Guru, the Divine Intermediary, who has united
        me with the Lord God.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  One who is attached
        to Maya is totally blind and deaf. He does not listen to the Word
        of the Shabad; he makes a great uproar and tumult. The Gurmukhs
        chant and meditate on the Shabad, and lovingly center their consciousness
        on it. They hear and believe in the Name of the Lord; they are
        absorbed in the Name of the Lord. Whatever pleases God, He causes
        that to be done. O Nanak, human beings are the instruments which
        vibrate as God plays them.  || 2 || </p>

      <p> PAUREE:  You, O Creator, know everything which occurs within our
        beings. You Yourself, O Creator, are incalculable, while the entire
        world is within the realm of calculation. Everything happens according
        to Your Will; You created all. You are the One, pervading in each
        and every heart; O True Lord and Master, this is Your play. One
        who meets the True Guru meets the Lord; no one can turn him away.
        || 24 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  Hold this mind steady and stable;
        become Gurmukh and focus your consciousness. How could you ever
        forget Him, with each breath and morsel of food, sitting down
        or standing up? My anxiety about birth and death has ended; this
        soul is under the control of the Lord God. If it pleases You,
        then save servant Nanak, and bless him with Your Name.  || 1 ||
        THIRD MEHL:  The egotistical, self-willed manmukh does not know
        the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; one moment he is here,
        and the next moment he is there. He is always invited, but he
        does not go to the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. How shall
        he be accepted in the Court of the Lord? How rare are those who
        know the Mansion of the True Guru; they stand with their palms
        pressed together. If my Lord grants His Grace, O Nanak, He restores
        them to Himself.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Fruitful and rewarding is
        that service, which is pleasing to the Guru's Mind. When
        the Mind of the True Guru is pleased, then sins and misdeeds run
        away. The Sikhs listen to the Teachings imparted by the True Guru.
        Those who surrender to the True Guru's Will are imbued with
        the four-fold Love of the Lord. This is the unique and distinct
        life-style of the Gurmukhs: listening to the Guru's Teachings,
        their minds blossom forth.  || 25 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Those
        who do not affirm their Guru shall have no home or place of rest.
        They lose both this world and the next; they have no place in
        the Court of the Lord. This opportunity to bow at the Feet of
        the True Guru shall never come again. If they miss out on being
        counted by the True Guru, they shall pass their lives in pain
        and misery. The True Guru, the Primal Being, has no hatred or
        vengeance; He unites with Himself those with whom He is pleased.
        O Nanak, those who behold the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, are
        emancipated in the Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL: 
        The self-willed manmukh is ignorant, evil-minded and egotistical.
        He is filled with anger within, and he loses his mind in the gamble.
        He commits the sins of fraud and unrighteousness. What can he
        hear, and what can he tell others? He is blind and deaf; he loses
        his way, and wanders lost in the wilderness. The blind, self-willed
        manmukh comes and goes in reincarnation; without meeting the True
        Guru, he finds no place of rest. O Nanak, he acts according to
        his pre-ordained destiny.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who have hearts
        as hard as stone, do not sit near the True Guru. Truth prevails
        there; the false ones do not attune their consciousness to it.
        By hook or by crook, they pass their time, and then they go back
        to sit with the false ones again. Falsehood does not mix with
        the Truth; O people, check it out and see. The false go and mingle
        with the false, while the truthful Sikhs sit by the side of the
        True Guru.  || </p>

      <p> 26 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  By their own efforts, the slanderers
        have destroyed all remnants of themselves. The Support of the
        Saints, O Nanak, is manifest, pervading everywhere.  || 1 || 
        FIFTH MEHL:  Those who went astray from the Primal Being in the
        very beginning  -  where can they find refuge? O Nanak, they
        are struck down by the All-powerful, the Cause of causes.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  They take the noose in their hands,
        and go out at night to strangle others, but God knows everything,
        O mortal. They spy on other men's women, concealed in their
        hiding places. They break into well-protected places, and revel
        in sweet wine. But they shall come to regret their actions  - 
        they create their own karma. Azraa-eel, the Angel of Death, shall
        crush them like sesame seeds in the oil-press.  || 27 ||   SHALOK,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The servants of the True King are acceptable and
        approved. Those ignorant ones who serve duality, O Nanak, rot,
        waste away and die.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  That destiny which
        was pre-ordained by God from the very beginning cannot be erased.
        The wealth of the Lord's Name is Nanak's capital; he
        meditates on it forever.  || 2 ||   PAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  One
        who has received a kick from the Lord God  -  where can he
        place his foot? He commits countless sins, and continually eats
        poison. Slandering others, he wastes away and dies; within his
        body, he burns. One who has been struck down by the True Lord
        and Master  -  who can save him now? Nanak has entered the
        Sanctuary of the Unseen Lord, the Primal Being.  || 28 ||   SHALOK,
        FIFTH MEHL:  In the most horrible hell, there is terrible pain
        and suffering. It is the place of the ungrateful. They are struck
        down by God, O Nanak, and they die a most miserable death.  ||
        1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  All kinds of medicines may be prepared, but
        there is no cure for the slanderer. Those whom the Lord Himself
        misleads, O Nanak, putrefy and rot in reincarnation.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  By His Pleasure, the True Guru has blessed
        me with the inexhaustible wealth of the Name of the True Lord.
        All my anxiety is ended; I am rid of the fear of death. Sexual
        desire, anger and other evils have been subdued in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. Those who serve another, instead of the
        True Lord, die unfulfilled in the end. The Guru has blessed Nanak
        with forgiveness; he is united with the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord.  || 29 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  He is not a penitent,
        who is greedy within his heart, and who constantly chases after
        Maya like a leper. When this penitent was first invited, he refused
        our charity; but later he repented and sent his son, who was seated
        in the congregation. The village elders all laughed, saying that
        the waves of greed have destroyed this penitent. If he sees only
        a little wealth, he does not bother to go there; but when he sees
        a lot of wealth, the penitent forsakes his vows. O Siblings of
        Destiny, he is not a penitent  -  he is only a stork. Sitting
        together, the Holy Congregation has so decided. The penitent slanders
        the True Primal Being, and sings the praises of the material world.
        For this sin, he is cursed by the Lord. Behold the fruit the penitent
        gathers, for slandering the Great Primal Being; all his labors
        have gone in vain. When he sits outside among the elders, he is
        called a penitent; but when he sits within the congregation, the
        penitent commits sin. <br>
