      <p> Let contentment be your father; the Guru is the Primal Being,
        beyond birth or incarnation. By great good fortune, you shall
        meet with the Lord.  || 1 ||   I have met the Guru, the Yogi,
        the Primal Being; I am delighted with His Love. The Guru is imbued
        with the Love of the Lord; He dwells forever in Nirvaanaa. By
        great good fortune, I met the most accomplished and all-knowing
        Lord. My mind and body are drenched in the Love of the Lord. 
        || 2 ||   Come, O Saints  -  let's meet together and chant
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord. In the Sangat, the Holy Congregation,
        let's earn the lasting profit of the Naam. Let's serve
        the Saints, and drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. By one's karma
        and pre-ordained destiny, they are met.  || 3 ||   In the month
        of Saawan, the clouds of Ambrosial Nectar hang over the world.
        The peacock of the mind chirps, and receives the Word of the Shabad,
        in its mouth; the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord rains down, and
        the Sovereign Lord King is met. Servant Nanak is imbued with the
        Love of the Lord.  || 4 || 1 || 27 || 65 ||   GAUREE MAAJH,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  Come, O sisters  -  let's make virtue our charms.
        Let's join the Saints, and enjoy the pleasure of the Lord's
        Love. The lamp of the Guru's spiritual wisdom burns steadily
        in my mind. The Lord, being pleased and moved by pity, has led
        me to meet Him.  || 1 ||   My mind and body are filled with love
        for my Darling Lord. The True Guru, the Divine Intermediary, has
        united me with my Friend. I offer my mind to the Guru, who has
        led me to meet my God. I am forever a sacrifice to the Lord. 
        || 2 ||   Dwell, O my Beloved, dwell, O my Lord of the Universe;
        O Lord, show mercy to me and come to dwell within my mind. I have
        obtained the fruits of my mind's desires, O my Lord of the
        Universe; I am transfixed with ecstasy, gazing upon the Perfect
        Guru. The happy soul-brides receive the Lord's Name, O my
        Lord of the Universe; night and day, their minds are blissful
        and happy. By great good fortune, the Lord is found, O my Lord
        of the Universe; earning profit continually, the mind laughs with
        joy.  || 3 ||   The Lord Himself creates, and the Lord Himself
        beholds; the Lord Himself assigns all to their tasks. Some partake
        of the bounty of the Lord's favor, which never runs out,
        while others receive only a handful. Some sit upon thrones as
        kings, and enjoy constant pleasures, while others must beg for
        charity. The Word of the Shabad is pervading in everyone, O my
        Lord of the Universe; servant Nanak meditates on the Naam.  ||
        4 || 2 || 28 || 66 ||   GAUREE MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  From within
        my mind, from within my mind, O my Lord of the Universe, I am
        imbued with the Love of the Lord, from within my mind. The Lord's
        Love is with me, but it cannot be seen, O my Lord of the Universe;
        the Perfect Guru has led me to see the unseen. He has revealed
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my Lord of the Universe; all
        poverty and pain have departed. I have obtained the supreme status
        of the Lord, O my Lord of the Universe; by great good fortune,
        I am absorbed in the Naam.  || 1 ||   With his eyes, O my Beloved,
        with his eyes, O my Lord of the Universe  -  has anyone ever
        seen the Lord God with his eyes? </p>

      <p> My mind and body are sad and depressed, O my Lord of the Universe;
        without her Husband Lord, the soul-bride is withering away. Meeting
        the Saints, O my Lord of the Universe, I have found my Lord God,
        my Companion, my Best Friend. The Lord, the Life of the World,
        has come to meet me, O my Lord of the Universe. The night of my
        life now passes in peace.  || 2 ||   O Saints, unite me with my
        Lord God, my Best Friend; my mind and body are hungry for Him.
        I cannot survive without seeing my Beloved; deep within, I feel
        the pain of separation from the Lord. The Sovereign Lord King
        is my Beloved, my Best Friend. Through the Guru, I have met Him,
        and my mind has been rejuvenated. The hopes of my mind and body
        have been fulfilled, O my Lord of the Universe; meeting the Lord,
        my mind vibrates with joy.  || 3 ||   A sacrifice, O my Lord of
        the Universe, a sacrifice, O my Beloved; I am forever a sacrifice
        to You. My mind and body are filled with love for my Husband Lord;
        O my Lord of the Universe, please preserve my assets. Unite me
        with the True Guru, Your Advisor, O my Lord of the Universe; through
        His guidance, He shall lead me to the Lord. I have obtained the
        Lord's Name, by Your Mercy, O my Lord of the Universe; servant
        Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary.  || 4 || 3 || 29 || 67 ||  
        GAUREE MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  Playful is my Lord of the Universe;
        playful is my Beloved. My Lord God is wondrous and playful. The
        Lord Himself created Krishna, O my Lord of the Universe; the Lord
        Himself is the milkmaids who seek Him. The Lord Himself enjoys
        every heart, O my Lord of the Universe; He Himself is the Ravisher
        and the Enjoyer. The Lord is All-knowing  -  He cannot be fooled,
        O my Lord of the Universe. He is the True Guru, the Yogi.  ||
        1 ||   He Himself created the world, O my Lord of the Universe;
        the Lord Himself plays in so many ways! Some enjoy enjoyments,
        O my Lord of the Universe, while others wander around naked, the
        poorest of the poor. He Himself created the world, O my Lord of
        the Universe; the Lord gives His gifts to all who beg for them.
        His devotees have the Support of the Naam, O my Lord of the Universe;
        they beg for the sublime sermon of the Lord.  || 2 ||   The Lord
        Himself inspires His devotees to worship Him, O my Lord of the
        Universe; the Lord fulfills the desires of the minds of His devotees.
        He Himself is permeating and pervading the waters and the lands,
        O my Lord of the Universe; He is All-pervading  -  He is not
        far away. The Lord Himself is within the self, and outside as
        well, O my Lord of the Universe; the Lord Himself is fully pervading
        everywhere. The Lord, the Supreme Soul, is diffused everywhere,
        O my Lord of the Universe. The Lord Himself beholds all; His Immanent
        Presence is pervading everywhere.  || 3 ||   O Lord, the music
        of the praanic wind is deep within, O my Lord of the Universe;
        as the Lord Himself plays this music, so does it vibrate and resound.
        O Lord, the treasure of the Naam is deep within, O my Lord of
        the Universe; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the
        Lord God is revealed. He Himself leads us to enter His Sanctuary,
        O my Lord of the Universe; the Lord preserves the honor of His
        devotees. </p>

      <p> By great good fortune, one joins the Sangat, the Holy Congregation,
        O my Lord of the Universe; O servant Nanak, through the Naam,
        one's affairs are resolved.  || 4 || 4 || 30 || 68 ||   GAUREE
        MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord has implanted a longing for the
        Lord's Name within me. I have met the Lord God, my Best Friend,
        and I have found peace. Beholding my Lord God, I live, O my mother.
        The Lord's Name is my Friend and Brother.  || 1 ||   O Dear
        Saints, sing the Glorious Praises of my Lord God. As Gurmukh,
        chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O very fortunate ones. The
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is my soul and my breath of life.
        I shall never again have to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
        || 2 ||   How shall I behold my Lord God? My mind and body yearn
        for Him. Unite me with the Lord, Dear Saints; my mind is in love
        with Him. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I have found
        the Sovereign Lord, my Beloved. O very fortunate ones, chant the
        Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Within my mind and body, there is
        such a great longing for God, the Lord of the Universe. Unite
        me with the Lord, Dear Saints. God, the Lord of the Universe,
        is so close to me. Through the Teachings of the True Guru, the
        Naam is always revealed; the desires of servant Nanak's mind
        have been fulfilled.  || 4 || 5 || 31 || 69 ||   GAUREE MAAJH,
        FOURTH MEHL:  If I receive my Love, the Naam, then I live. In
        the temple of the mind, is the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord; through
        the Guru's Teachings, we drink it in. My mind is drenched
        with the Love of the Lord. I continually drink in the sublime
        essence of the Lord. I have found the Lord within my mind, and
        so I live.  || 1 ||   The arrow of the Lord's Love has pierced
        by mind and body. The Lord, the Primal Being, is All-knowing;
        He is my Beloved and my Best Friend. The Saintly Guru has united
        me with the All-knowing and All-seeing Lord. I am a sacrifice
        to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   I seek my Lord,
        Har, Har, my Intimate, my Best Friend. Show me the way to the
        Lord, Dear Saints; I am searching all over for Him. The Kind and
        Compassionate True Guru has shown me the Way, and I have found
        the Lord. Through the Name of the Lord, I am absorbed in the Naam.
        || 3 ||   I am consumed with the pain of separation from the
        Love of the Lord. The Guru has fulfilled my desire, and I have
        received the Ambrosial Nectar in my mouth. The Lord has become
        merciful, and now I meditate on the Name of the Lord. Servant
        Nanak has obtained the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 4 || 6

      </center>
      <p> How can happiness be found, O my Siblings of Destiny? How can
        the Lord, our Help and Support, be found?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        There is no happiness in owning one's own home, in all
        of Maya, or in lofty mansions casting beautiful shadows. In fraud
        and greed, this human life is being wasted.  || </p>

      <p> 1 ||   He is pleased at the sight of his elephants and horses
        and his armies assembled, his servants and his soldiers. But the
        noose of egotism is tightening around his neck.  || 2 ||   His
        rule may extend in all ten directions; he may revel in pleasures,
        and enjoy many women  -  but he is just a beggar, who in his
        dream, is a king.  || 3 ||   The True Guru has shown me that there
        is only one pleasure. Whatever the Lord does, is pleasing to the
        Lord's devotee. Servant Nanak has abolished his ego, and
        he is absorbed in the Lord.  || 4 ||   This is the way to find
        happiness, O my Siblings of Destiny. This is the way to find the
        Lord, our Help and Support.  || 1 ||  Second Pause  ||   GAUREE
        GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Why do you doubt? What do you doubt?
        God is pervading the water, the land and the sky. The Gurmukhs
        are saved, while the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor.  ||
        1 ||   One who is protected by the Merciful Lord  -  no one
        else can rival him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Infinite One is
        pervading among all. So sleep in peace, and don't worry.
        He knows everything which happens.  || 2 ||   The self-willed
        manmukhs are dying in the thirst of duality. They wander lost
        through countless incarnations; this is their pre-ordained destiny.
        As they plant, so shall they harvest.  || 3 ||   Beholding the
        Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, my mind has blossomed
        forth. And now everywhere I look, God is revealed to me. Servant
        Nanak's hopes have been fulfilled by the Lord.  || 4 || 2
        || 71 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  In so many incarnations,
        you were a worm and an insect; in so many incarnations, you were
        an elephant, a fish and a deer. In so many incarnations, you were
        a bird and a snake. In so many incarnations, you were yoked as
        an ox and a horse.  || 1 ||   Meet the Lord of the Universe  - 
        now is the time to meet Him. After so very long, this human body
        was fashioned for you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In so many incarnations,
        you were rocks and mountains; in so many incarnations, you were
        aborted in the womb; in so many incarnations, you developed branches
        and leaves; you wandered through 8.4 million incarnations.  ||
        2 ||   Through the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you
        obtained this human life. Do seva  -  selfless service; follow
        the Guru's Teachings, and vibrate the Lord's Name, Har,
        Har. Abandon pride, falsehood and arrogance. Remain dead while
        yet alive, and you shall be welcomed in the Court of the Lord.
        || 3 ||   Whatever has been, and whatever shall be, comes from
        You, Lord. No one else can do anything at all. We are united with
        You, when You unite us with Yourself. Says Nanak, sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4 || 3 || 72 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  In the field of karma, plant the seed of the Naam.
        Your works shall be brought to fruition. You shall obtain these
        fruits, and the fear of death shall be dispelled. Sing continually
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   Keep the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, enshrined in your heart, and your
        affairs shall be quickly resolved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Be always
        attentive to your God; thus you shall be honored in His Court. </p>

        the Feet of the Saints.  || 2 ||   The One, who holds all creatures
        in His Hands, is never separated from them; He is with them all.
        Abandon your clever devices, and grasp hold of His Support. In
        an instant, you shall be saved.  || 3 ||   Know that He is always

        Teachings, eradicate selfishness and conceit. O Nanak, chant and
        meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4 ||
        4 || 73 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Guru's

        Through the Guru's Word, one is immersed in the Love of the
        Lord.  || 1 ||   Whatever the Guru gives, is useful to the mind.
        Whatever the Saint does  -  accept that as True.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   The Guru's Word is infallible and unchanging.
        Through the Guru's Word, doubt and prejudice are dispelled.
        The Guru's Word never goes away; through the Guru's
        Word, we sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 2 ||   The
        Guru's Word accompanies the soul. The Guru's Word is
        the Master of the masterless. The Guru's Word saves one from
        falling into hell. Through the Guru's Word, the tongue savors
        the Ambrosial Nectar.  || 3 ||   The Guru's Word is revealed
        in the world. Through the Guru's Word, no one suffers defeat.
        O Nanak, the True Guru is always kind and compassionate, unto
        those whom the Lord Himself has blessed with His Mercy.  || 4
        || 5 || 74 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He makes jewels
        out of the dust, and He managed to preserve you in the womb. He
        has given you fame and greatness; meditate on that God, twenty-four
        hours a day.  || 1 ||   O Lord, I seek the dust of the feet of
        the Holy. Meeting the Guru, I meditate on my Lord and Master.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He transformed me, the fool, into a fine
        speaker, and He made the unconscious become conscious; by His
        Grace, I have obtained the nine treasures. May I never forget
        that God from my mind.  || 2 ||   He has given a home to the homeless;
        He has given honor to the dishonored. He has fulfilled all desires;
        remember Him in meditation, day and night, with every breath and
        every morsel of food.  || 3 ||   By His Grace, the bonds of Maya
        are cut away. By Guru's Grace, the bitter poison has become
        Ambrosial Nectar. Says Nanak, I cannot do anything; I praise the
        Lord, the Protector.  || 4 || 6 || 75 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  In His Sanctuary, there is no fear or sorrow. Without
        Him, nothing at all can be done. I have renounced clever tricks,
        power and intellectual corruption. God is the Protector of His
        servant.  || 1 ||   Meditate, O my mind, on the Lord, Raam, Raam,
        with love. Within your home, and beyond it, He is always with
        you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Keep His Support in your mind. </p>

        why should I now go out searching for them?  || 2 ||   When God
        Himself becomes merciful, the work of His servant becomes perfect.
        He has cut away my bonds, and made me His slave. Remember, remember,
        remember Him in meditation; He is the treasure of excellence.
        || 3 ||   He alone is in the mind; He alone is everywhere. The
        Perfect Lord is totally permeating and pervading everywhere. The
        Perfect Guru has dispelled all doubts. Remembering the Lord in
        meditation, Nanak has found peace.  || 4 || 8 || 77 ||   GAUREE
        GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those who have died have been forgotten.
        Those who survive have fastened their belts. They are busily occupied
        in their affairs; they cling twice as hard to Maya.  || 1 || 
        No one thinks of the time of death; people grasp to hold that
        which shall pass away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The fools  - 
        their bodies are bound down by desires. They are mired in sexual
        desire, anger and attachment; the Righteous Judge of Dharma stands
        over their heads. Believing it to be sweet, the fools eat poison.
        || 2 ||   They say, &quot;I shall tie up my enemy, and I shall
        cut him down. Who dares to set foot upon my land? I am learned,
        I am clever and wise.&quot; The ignorant ones do not recognize
        their Creator.  || 3 ||   The Lord Himself knows His Own state
        and condition. What can anyone say? How can anyone describe Him?
        Whatever He attaches us to  -  to that we are attached. Everyone
        begs for their own good.  || 4 ||   Everything is Yours; You are
        the Creator Lord. You have no end or limitation. Please give this
        gift to Your servant, that Nanak might never forget the Naam.
        || 5 || 9 || 78 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  By all
        sorts of efforts, people do not find salvation. Through clever
        tricks, the weight is only piled on more and more. </p>

      <p> Serving the Lord with a pure heart, you shall be received with
        honor at God's Court.  || 1 ||   O my mind, hold tight to
        the Support of the Lord's Name. The hot winds shall never
        even touch you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Like a boat in the ocean
        of fear; like a lamp which illumines the darkness; like fire which
        takes away the pain of cold  -  just so, chanting the Name,
        the mind becomes peaceful.  || 2 ||   The thirst of your mind
        shall be quenched, and all hopes shall be fulfilled. Your consciousness
        shall not waver. Meditate on the Ambrosial Naam as Gurmukh, O
        my friend.  || 3 ||   He alone receives the panacea, the medicine
        of the Naam, unto whom the Lord, in His Grace, bestows it. One
        whose heart is filled with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har  - 
        O Nanak, his pains and sorrows are eliminated.  || 4 || 10 ||
        79 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Even with vast sums of
        wealth, the mind is not satisfied. Gazing upon countless beauties,
        the man is not satisfied. He is so involved with his wife and
        sons  -  he believes that they belong to him. That wealth shall
        pass away, and those relatives shall be reduced to ashes.  ||
        1 ||   Without meditating and vibrating on the Lord, they are
        crying out in pain. Their bodies are cursed, and their wealth
        is cursed  -  they are imbued with Maya.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The servant carries the bags of money on his head, but it goes
        to his master's house, and he receives only pain. The man
        sits as a king in his dreams, but when he opens his eyes, he sees
        that it was all in vain.  || 2 ||   The watchman oversees the
        field of another, but the field belongs to his master, while he
        must get up and depart. He works so hard, and suffers for that
        field, but still, nothing comes into his hands.  || 3 ||   The
        dream is His, and the kingdom is His; He who has given the wealth
        of Maya, has infused the desire for it. He Himself annihilates,
        and He Himself restores. Nanak offers this prayer to God.  ||
        4 || 11 || 80 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have gazed
        upon the many forms of Maya, in so many ways. With pen and paper,
        I have written clever things. I have seen what it is to be a chief,
        a king, and an emperor, but they do not satisfy the mind.  ||
        1 ||   Show me that peace, O Saints, which will quench my thirst
        and satisfy my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You may have horses
        as fast as the wind, elephants to ride on, sandalwood oil, and
        beautiful women in bed, actors in dramas, singing in theaters
        -  but even with them, the mind does not find contentment.
        || 2 ||   You may have a throne at the royal court, with beautiful
        decorations and soft carpets, all sorts of luscious fruits and
        beautiful gardens, the excitement of the chase and princely pleasures
        -  but still, the mind is not made happy by such illusory
        diversions.  || 3 ||   In their kindness, the Saints have told
        me of the True One, and so I have obtained all comforts and joy.
        In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing the Kirtan
        of the Lord's Praises. Says Nanak, through great good fortune,
        I have found this.  || 4 ||   One who obtains the wealth of the
        Lord becomes happy. By God's Grace, I have joined the Saadh
        Sangat.  || 1 ||  Second Pause  || 12 || 81 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE, </p>

      <p> FIFTH MEHL:  The mortal claims this body as his own. Again and
        again, he clings to it. He is entangled with his children, his
        wife and household affairs. He cannot be the slave of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   What is that way, by which the Lord's Praises
        might be sung? What is that intellect, by which this person might
        swim across, O mother?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That which is for
        his own good, he thinks is evil. If someone tells him the truth,
        he looks upon that as poison. He cannot tell victory from defeat.
        This is the way of life in the world of the faithless cynic. 
        || 2 ||   The demented fool drinks in the deadly poison, while
        he believes the Ambrosial Naam to be bitter. He does not even
        approach the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; he wanders
        lost through 8.4 million incarnations.  || 3 ||   The birds are
        caught in the net of Maya; immersed in the pleasures of love,
        they frolic in so many ways. Says Nanak, the Perfect Guru has
        cut away the noose from those, unto whom the Lord has shown His
        Mercy.  || 4 || 13 || 82 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        By Your Grace, we find the Way. By God's Grace, we meditate
        on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. By God's Grace, we are
        released from our bondage. By Your Grace, egotism is eradicated.
        || 1 ||   As You assign me, so I take to Your service. By myself,
        I cannot do anything at all, O Divine Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        If it pleases You, then I sing the Word of Your Bani. If it
        pleases You, then I speak the Truth. If it pleases You, then the
        True Guru showers His Mercy upon me. All peace comes by Your Kindness,
        God.  || 2 ||   Whatever pleases You is a pure action of karma.
        Whatever pleases You is the true faith of Dharma. The treasure
        of all excellence is with You. Your servant prays to You, O Lord
        and Master.  || 3 ||   The mind and body become immaculate through
        the Lord's Love. All peace is found in the Sat Sangat, the
        True Congregation. My mind remains attuned to Your Name; Nanak
        affirms this as his greatest pleasure.  || 4 || 14 || 83 ||  
        GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You may taste the other flavors,
        but your thirst shall not depart, even for an instant. But when
        you taste the sweet flavor the the Lord's sublime essence
        -  upon tasting it, you shall be wonder-struck and amazed.
        || 1 ||   O dear beloved tongue, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.
        Imbued with this sublime essence, you shall be satisfied.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   O tongue, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        Each and every moment, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, Har. Do
        not listen to any other, and do not go anywhere else. By great
        good fortune, you shall find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy.  || 2 ||   Twenty-four hours a day, O tongue, dwell
        upon God, the Unfathomable, Supreme Lord and Master. Here and
        hereafter, you shall be happy forever. Chanting the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, O tongue, you shall become priceless.  || 3 ||  
        All the vegetation will blossom forth for you, flowering in fruition;
        imbued with this sublime essence, you shall never leave it again.
        No other sweet and tasty flavors can compare to it. Says Nanak,

      <p> The infinite substance is within it. Within it, the great merchant
        is said to dwell. Who is the trader who deals there?  || 1 ||
        How rare is that trader who deals in the jewel of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. He takes the Ambrosial Nectar as his food.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He dedicates his mind and body to serving
        the Lord. How can we please the Lord? I fall at His Feet, and
        I renounce all sense of 'mine and yours'. Who can settle
        this bargain?  || 2 ||   How can I attain the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence? How can I get Him to call me inside? You are the Great
        Merchant; You have millions of traders. Who is the benefactor?
        Who can take me to Him?  || 3 ||   Seeking and searching, I have
        found my own home, deep within my own being. The True Lord has

        Night and day, they remain in the Love of the One. They know
        that God is always with them. They make the Name of their Lord
        and Master their way of life; they are satisfied and fulfilled
        with the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.  || 1 || 
        Imbued with the Love of the Lord, their minds and bodies are
        rejuvenated, entering the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The Lord's Lotus Feet are the Support of
        the soul. They see only the One, and obey His Order. There is
        only one trade, and one occupation. They know no other than the
        Formless Lord.  || 2 ||   They are free of both pleasure and pain.
        They remain unattached, joined to the Lord's Way. They are
        seen among all, and yet they are distinct from all. They focus
        their meditation on the Supreme Lord God.  || 3 ||   How can I
        describe the Glories of the Saints? Their knowledge is unfathomable;
        their limits cannot be known. O Supreme Lord God, please shower
        Your Mercy upon me. Bless Nanak with the dust of the feet of the
        Saints.  || 4 || 17 || 86 ||   GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        You are my Companion; You are my Best Friend. You are my Beloved;
        I am in love with You. You are my honor; You are my decoration.
        Without You, I cannot survive, even for an instant.  || 1 ||

        You keep me, so do I survive. Whatever You say, that is what I
        do. Wherever I look, there I see You dwelling. O my Fearless Lord,
        with my tongue, I chant Your Name.  || 2 ||   You are my nine

        It torments us through the intoxication of wine and the beauty
        of youth.  || 2 ||   It torments landlords, paupers and lovers
        of pleasure. It torments us through the sweet sounds of music

        who are imbued with the Love of the Lord.  || 4 ||   The Sovereign
        Lord King has cut away the bonds of His Saints. How can Maya torment

        flavors. The mind is asleep, fascinated by Maya.  || 1 ||   Those

        receive the whole thing.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All of my companions
        are intoxicated with their sensory pleasures; they do not know
        how to guard their own home. The five thieves have plundered them;
        the thugs descend upon the unguarded village.  || 2 ||   Our mothers
        and fathers cannot save us from them; friends and brothers cannot
        protect us from them  -  they cannot be restrained by wealth
        or cleverness. Only through the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the

        and property shall remain intact.  || 1 ||  Second Pause  || 20

        are erased. By the Grace of the Saints, one is released from bondage.

        of my soul is with the Holy.  || 3 ||   Meditating on the Merciful
        Lord, the Treasure of Mercy, I have obtained a seat in the Saadh

        Shedding my ego, I have become free of hate. Twenty-four hours
        a day, I worship the Guru's Feet.  || 1 ||   Now, my evil

        of the Lord with my ears.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Savior Lord
        is the treasure of intuitive peace, poise and bliss. He shall
        save me in the end. My pains, sufferings, fears and doubts have

        in reincarnation.  || 2 ||   He Himself beholds, speaks and hears
        all. O my mind, meditate on the One who is always with you. By
        the Grace of the Saints, the Light has dawned. The One Lord, the
        Treasure of Excellence, is perfectly pervading everywhere.  ||

        to chant the Lord's Name. With the mind centered in meditation
        on the True Lord, anguish is eradicated, and one comes to dwell
        in peace. Such is the True Guru, the Great Giver.  || 1 ||   He
        alone is the Giver of peace, who inspires us to chant the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. By His Grace, He leads us to merge with
        Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He unites with Himself those unto whom
