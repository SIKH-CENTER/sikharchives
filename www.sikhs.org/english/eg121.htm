      <p> <font color="#000000">Eating, drinking, laughing and sleeping, the
        mortal forgets about dying. Forgetting his Lord and Master, the
        mortal is ruined, and his life is cursed. He cannot remain forever.
        || 1 ||   O mortal, meditate on the One Lord. You shall go to
        your true home with honor.  || 1  Pause  ||   Those who serve
        You - what can they give You? They beg for and receive
        what cannot remain. You are the Great Giver of all souls; You
        are the Life within all living beings.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukhs
        meditate, and receive the Ambrosial Nectar; thus they become pure.
        Day and night, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mortal.
        It makes the filthy immacuate.  || 3 ||   As is the season, so
        is the comfort of the body, and so is the body itself. O Nanak,
        that season is beautiful; without the Name, what season is it?
        || 4 || 1 ||   MALAAR,  FIRST MEHL:  I offer prayers to my Beloved
        Guru, that He may unite me with my Husband Lord. I hear the thunder
        in the clouds, and my mind is cooled and soothed; imbued with
        the Love of my Dear Beloved, I sing His Glorious Praises.  ||
        1 ||   The rain pours down, and my mind is drenched with His Love.
        The drop of Ambrosial Nectar pleases my heart; the Guru has fascinated
        my mind, which is drenched in the sublime essence of the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   With intuitive peace and poise, the soul-bride
        is loved by her Husband Lord; her mind is pleased and appeased
        by the Guru's Teachings. She is the happy soul-bride of
        her Husband Lord; her mind and body are filled with joy by His
        Love.  || 2 ||   Discarding her demerits, she becomes detached;
        with the Lord as her Husband, her marriage is eternal. She never
        suffers separation or sorrow; her Lord God showers her with His
        Grace.  || 3 ||   Her mind is steady and stable; she does not
        come and go in reincarnation. She takes the Shelter of the Perfect
        Guru. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, chant the Naam; you shall be accepted
        as the true soul-bride of the Lord.  || 4 || 2 ||   MALAAR,  FIRST
        MEHL:  They pretend to understand the Truth, but they are not
        satisfied by the Naam; they waste their lives in egotism. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Caught in slander and attachment to the wealth and women of others,
        they eat poison and suffer in pain. They think about the Shabad,
        but they are not released from their fear and fraud; the minds
        and mouths are filled with Maya, Maya. Loading the heavy and crushing
        load, they die, only to be reborn, and waste their lives again.
        || 1 ||   The Word of the Shabad is so very beautiful; it is
        pleasing to my mind. The mortal wanders lost in reincarnation,
        wearing various robes and clothes; when he is saved and protected
        by the Guru, then he finds the Truth.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He
        does not try to wash away his angry passions by bathing at sacred
        shrines. He does not love the Name of the Lord. He abandons and
        discards the priceless jewel, and he goes back from where he came.
        And so he becomes a maggot in manure, and in that, he is absorbed.
        The more he tastes, the more he is diseased; without the Guru,
        there is no peace and poise.  || 2 ||   Focusing my awareness
        on selfless service, I joyfully sing His Praises. As Gurmukh,
        I contemplate spiritual wisdom. The seeker comes forth, and the
        debater dies down; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Guru,
        the Creator Lord. I am low and wretched, with shallow and false
        understanding; You embellish and exalt me through the Word of
        Your Shabad. And wherever there is self-realization, You are there;
        O True Lord Savior, You save us and carry us across.  || 3 ||
        Where should I sit to chant Your Praises; which of Your Infinite
        Praises should I chant? The Unknown cannot be known; O Inaccessible,
        Unborn Lord God, You are the Lord and Master of masters. How can
        I compare You to anyone else I see? All are beggars - You
        are the Great Giver. Lacking devotion, Nanak looks to Your Door;
        please bless him with Your One Name, that he may enshrine it in
        his heart.  || 4 || 3 ||   MALAAR,  FIRST MEHL:  The soul-bride
        who has not known delight with her Husband Lord, shall weep and
        wail with a wretched face. She becomes hopeless, caught in the
        noose of her own karma; without the Guru, she wanders deluded
        by doubt.  || 1 ||   So rain down, O clouds. My Husband Lord has
        come home. I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has led me to meet
        my Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My love, my Lord and Master
        is forever fresh; I am embellished with devotional worship night
        and day. I am liberated, gazing on the Blessed Vision of the Guru's
        Darshan. Devotional worship has made me glorious and exalted throughout
        the ages.  || 2 ||   I am Yours; the three worlds are Yours as
        well. You are mine, and I am Yours. Meeting with the True Guru,
        I have found the Immaculate Lord; I shall not be consigned to
        this terrifying world-ocean ever again.  || 3 ||   If the soul-bride
        is filled with delight on seeing her Husband Lord, then her decorations
        are true. With the Immaculate Celestial Lord, she becomes the
        truest of the true. Following the Guru's Teachings, she
        leans on the Support of the Naam.  || 4 ||   She is liberated;
        the Guru has untied her bonds. Focusing her awareness on the Shabad,
        she attains honor. O Nanak, the Lord's Name is deep within
        her heart; as Gurmukh, she is united in His Union.  || 5 || 4
        ||  FIRST MEHL,  MALAAR:  Others' wives, others'
        wealth, greed, egotism, corruption and poison; evil passions,
        slander of others, sexual desire and anger - give up all
        these.  || 1 ||   The Inaccessible, Infinite Lord is sitting in
        His Mansion. <br>

      <p> That humble being, whose conduct is in harmony with the jewel
        of the Guru's Shabad, obtains the Ambrosial Nectar.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   He sees pleasure and pain as both the same,
        along with good and bad in the world. Wisdom, understanding and
        awareness are found in the Name of the Lord. In the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, embrace love for the Guru.  || 2 ||   Day
        and night, profit is obtained through the Lord's Name.
        The Guru, the Giver, has given this gift. That Sikh who becomes
        Gurmukh obtains it. The Creator blesses him with His Glance of
        Grace.  || 3 ||   The body is a mansion, a temple, the home of
        the Lord; He has infused His Infinite Light into it. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukh is invited to the Mansion of the Lord's Presence;
        the Lord unites him in His Union.  || 4 || 5 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Know that the creation was formed through
        air and water; have no doubt that the body was made through fire.
        And if you know where the soul comes from, you shall be known
        as a wise religious scholar.  || 1 ||   Who can know the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord of the Universe, O mother? Without seeing
        Him, we cannot say anything about Him. How can anyone speak and
        describe Him, O mother?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is high above
        the sky, and beneath the nether worlds. How can I speak of Him?
        Let me understand. Who knows what sort of Name is chanted, in
        the heart, without the tongue?  || 2 ||   Undoubtedly, words fail
        me. He alone understands, who is blessed. Day and night, deep
        within, he remains lovingly attuned to the Lord. He is the true
        person, who is merged in the True Lord.  || 3 ||   If someone
        of high social standing becomes a selfless servant, then his praises
        cannot even be expressed. And if someone from a low social class
        becomes a selfless servant, O Nanak, he shall wear shoes of honor.
        || 4 || 1 || 6 ||   MALAAR,  FIRST MEHL:  The pain of separation
        - this is the hungry pain I feel. Another pain is the attack
        of the Messenger of Death. Another pain is the disease consuming
        my body. O foolish doctor, don't give me medicine.  ||
        1 ||   O foolish doctor, don't give me medicine. The pain
        persists, and the body continues to suffer. Your medicine has
        no effect on me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Forgetting his Lord and
        Master, the mortal enjoys sensual pleasures; then, disease rises
        up in his body. The blind mortal receives his punishment. O foolish
        doctor, don't give me medicine.  || 2 ||   The value of
        sandalwood lies in its fragrance. The value of the human lasts
        only as long as the breath in the body. When the breath is taken
        away, the body crumbles into dust. After that, no one takes any
        food.  || 3 ||   The mortal's body is golden, and the soul-swan
        is immaculate and pure, if even a tiny particle of the Immaculate
        Naam is within. All pain and disease are eradicated. O Nanak,
        the mortal is saved through the True Name.  || 4 || 2 || 7 ||
        MALAAR,  FIRST MEHL:  Pain is the poison. The Lord's
        Name is the antidote. <br>

      <p> Grind it up in the mortar of contentment, with the pestle of charitable
        giving. Take it each and every day, and your body shall not waste
        away. At the very last instant, you shall strike down the Messenger
        of Death.  || 1 ||   So take such medicine, O fool, by which your
        corruption shall be taken away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Power, wealth
        and youth are all just shadows, as are the vehicles you see moving
        around. Neither your body, nor your fame, nor your social status
        shall go along with you. In the next world it is day, while here,
        it is all night.  || 2 ||   Let your taste for pleasures be the
        firewood, let your greed be the ghee, and your sexual desire and
        anger the cooking oil; burn them in the fire. Some make burnt
        offerings, hold sacred feasts, and read the Puraanas. Whatever
        pleases God is acceptable.  || 3 ||   Intense meditation is the
        paper, and Your Name is the insignia. Those for whom this treasure
        is ordered, look wealthy when they reach their true home. O Nanak,
        blessed is that mother who gave birth to them.  || 4 || 3 || 8
        ||   MALAAR,  FIRST MEHL:  You wear white clothes, and speak sweet
        words. Your nose is sharp, and your eyes are black. Have you ever
        seen your Lord and Master, O sister?  || 1 ||   O my All-powerful
        Lord and Master, by Your power, I fly and soar, and ascend to
        the heavens. I see Him in the water, on the land, in the mountains,
        on the river-banks, in all places and interspaces, O brother.
        || 2 ||   He fashioned the body, and gave it wings; He gave it
        great thirst and desire to fly. When He bestows His Glance of
        Grace, I am comforted and consoled. As He makes me see, so do
        I see, O brother.  || 3 ||   Neither this body, nor its wings,
        shall go to the world hereafter. It is a fusion of air, water
        and fire. O Nanak, if it is in the mortal's karma, then
        he meditates on the Lord, with the Guru as his Spiritual Teacher.
        This body is absorbed in the Truth.  || 4 || 4 || 9 || <br>

        Himself deludes in doubt. Creating the Creation, the Creator Himself
        beholds it; He enjoins us as He pleases. This is the true greatness
        of His servant, that he obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command.
        || 1 ||   Only He Himself knows His Will. By Guru's Grace,
        it is grasped. When this play of Shiva and Shakti comes to his
        home, he remains dead while yet alive.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They
        read the Vedas, and read them again, and engage in arguments about
        Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. This three-phased Maya has deluded the
        whole world into cynicism about death and birth. By Guru's
        Grace, know the One Lord, and the anxiety of your mind will be
        allayed.  || 2 ||   I am meek, foolish and thoughtless, but still,
        You take care of me. Please be kind to me, and make me the slave
        of Your slaves, so that I may serve You. Please bless me with
        the treasure of the One Name, that I may chant it, day and night.
        || 3 ||   Says Nanak, by Guru's Grace, understand. Hardly
        anyone considers this. Like foam bubbling up on the surface of

      <p> It shall eventually merge back into that from which it came, and
        all its expanse shall be gone.  || 4 || 1 ||   MALAAR,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Those who realize the Hukam of the Lord's Command
        are united with Him; through the Word of His Shabad, their egotism
        is burnt away. They perform true devotional worship day and night;
        they remain lovingly attuned to the True Lord. They gaze on their
        True Lord forever, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        with loving ease.  || 1 ||   O mortal, accept His Will and find
        peace. God is pleased by the Pleasure of His Own Will. Whomever
        He forgives, meets no obstacles on the way.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Under the influence of the three gunas, the three dispositions,
        the mind wanders everywhere, without love or devotion to the Lord.
        No one is ever saved or liberated, by doing deeds in ego. Whatever
        our Lord and Master wills, comes to pass. People wander according
        to their past actions.  || 2 ||   Meeting with the True Guru,
        the mind is overpowered; the Lord's Name comes to abide
        in the mind. The value of such a person cannot be estimated; nothing
        at all can be said about him. He comes to dwell in the fourth
        state; he remains merged in the True Lord.  || 3 ||   My Lord
        God is Inaccessible and Unfathomable. His value cannot be expressed.
        By Guru's Grace, he comes to understand, and live the Shabad.
        O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; you
        shall be honored in the Court of the Lord.  || 4 || 2 ||   MALAAR,
        THIRD MEHL:  Rare is that person who, as Gurmukh, understands;
        the Lord has bestowed His Glance of Grace. There is no Giver except
        the Guru. He grants His Grace and forgives. Meeting the Guru,
        peace and tranquility well up; chant the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, day and night.  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate on the Ambrosial
        Name of the Lord. Meeting with the True Guru and the Primal Being,
        the Name is obtained, and one remains forever absorbed in the
        Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukhs
        are forever separated from the Lord; no one is with them. They
        are stricken with the great disease of egotism; they are hit on
        the head by the Messenger of Death. Those who follow the Guru's
        Teachings are never separated from the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
        They dwell on the Naam, night and day.  || 2 ||   You are the
        One and Only Creator of all. You continually create, watch over
        and contemplate. Some are Gurmukh - You unite them with
        Yourself. You bless then with the treasure of devotion. You Yourself
        know everything. Unto whom should I complain?  || 3 ||   The Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har, is Ambrosial Nectar. By the Lord's
        Grace, it is obtained. OChanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        night and day, the intuitive peace and poise of the Guru is obtained.
        O Nanak, the Naam is the greatest treasure. Focus your consciousness
        on the Naam.  || 4 || 3 ||   MALAAR,  THIRD MEHL:  I praise the
        Guru, the Giver of peace, forever. He truly is the Lord God. By
        Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status. His glorious
        greatness is glorious! One who sings the Glorious Praises of the
        True Lord, merges in the True Lord.  || 1 ||   O mortal, contemplate
        the Guru's Word in your heart. Abandon your false family,
        poisonous egotism and desire; remember in your heart, that you
        will have to leave.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The True Guru is the
        Giver of the Lord's Name. There is no other giver at all. <br>

      <p> Bestowing the gift of the soul, He satisfies the mortal beings,
        and merges them in the True Name. Night and day, they ravish and
        enjoy the Lord within the heart; they are intuitively absorbed
        in Samaadhi.  || 2 ||   The Shabad, the Word of the True Guru,
        has pierced my mind. The True Word of His Bani permeates my heart.
        My God is Unseen; He cannot be seen. The Gurmukh speaks the Unspoken.
        When the Giver of peace grants His Grace, the mortal being meditates
        on the Lord, the Life of the Universe.  || 3 ||   He does not
        come and go in renicarnation any longer; the Gurmukh meditates
        intuitively. From the mind, the mind merges into our Lord and
        Master; the mind is absorbed into the Mind. In truth, the True
        Lord is pleased with truth; eradicate egotism from within yourself.
        || 4 ||   Our One and Only Lord and Master dwells within the
        mind; there is no other at all. The One Name is Sweet Ambrosial
        Nectar; it is Immaculate Truth in the world. O Nanak, the Name
        of God is obtained, by those who are so predestined.  || 5 ||
        4 ||   MALAAR,  THIRD MEHL:  All the heavenly heralds and celestial
        singers are saved through the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They
        contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Subduing their
        ego, the Name abides in their minds; they keep the Lord enshrined
        in their hearts. He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to
        understand; the Lord unites him with Himself. Night and day, he
        sings the Word of the Shabad and the Guru's Bani; he remains
        lovingly attuned to the True Lord.  || 1 ||   O my mind, each
        and every moment, dwell on the Naam. The Shabad is the Guru's
        Gift. It shall bring you lasting peace deep within; it shall always
        stand by you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukhs never
        give up their hypocrisy; in the love of duality, they suffer in
        pain. Forgetting the Naam, their minds are imbued with corruption.
        They waste away their lives uselessly. This opportunity shall
        not come into their hands again; night and day, they shall always
        regret and repent. They die and die again and again, only to be
        reborn, but they never understand. They rot away in manure.  ||
        2 ||   The Gurmukhs are imbued with the Naam, and are saved; they
        contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Meditating on
        the Name of the Lord, they are Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet
        alive. They enshrine the Lord within their hearts. Their minds
        and bodies are immaculate, their intellect is immaculate and sublime.
        Their speech is sublime as well. They realize the One Primal Being,
        the One Lord God. There is no other at all.  || 3 ||   God Himself
        is the Doer, and He Himself is the Cause of causes. He Himself
        bestows His Glance of Grace. My mind and body are imbued with
        the Word of the Guru's Bani. My consciousness is immersed
        in His service. The Unseen and Inscrutable Lord dwells deep within.
        He is seen only by the Gurmukh. O Nanak, He gives to whomever
        He pleases. According to the Pleasure of His Will, He leads the
        mortals on.  || 4 || 5 ||   MALAAR,  THIRD MEHL,  DU-TUKAS:  Through
        the True Guru, the mortal obtains the special place, the Mansion
        of the Lord's Presence in his own home. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, his egotistical pride is dispelled.
        || 1 ||   Those who have the Naam inscribed on their foreheads,
        meditate on the Naam night and day, forever and ever. They are
        honored in the True Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   From
        the True Guru, they learn the ways and means of the mind. <br>

      <p> Night and day, they focus their meditation on the Lord forever.
        Imbued with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they remain
        forever detached. They are honored in the True Court of the Lord.
        || 2 ||   This mind plays, subject to the Lord's Will;
        in an instant, it wanders out in the ten directions and returns
        home again. When the True Lord God Himself bestows His Glance
        of Grace, then this mind is instantly brought under control by
        the Gurmukh.  || 3 ||   The mortal comes to know the ways and
        means of the mind, realizing and contemplating the Shabad. O Nanak,
        meditate forever on the Naam, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
        || 4 || 6 ||   MALAAR,  THIRD MEHL:  Soul, body and breath of
        life are all His; He is permeating and pervading each and every
        heart. Except the One Lord, I do not know any other at all. The
        True Guru has revealed this to me.  || 1 ||   O my mind, remain
        lovingly attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Through the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, I meditate on the Lord, the
        Unseen, Unfathomable and Infinite Creator.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Mind and body are pleased, lovingly attuned to the One Lord,
        intuitively absorbed in peace and poise. By Guru's Grace,
        doubt and fear are dispelled, being lovingly attuned to the One
        Name.  || 2 ||   When the mortal follows the Guru's Teachings,
        and lives the Truth, then he attains the state of emancipation.
        Among millions, how rare is that one who understands, and is lovingly
        attuned to the Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Wherever I look, there
        I see the One. This understanding has come through the Guru's
        Teachings. I place my mind, body and breath of life in offering
        before Him; O Nanak, self-conceit is gone.  || 4 || 7 ||   MALAAR,
        THIRD MEHL:  My True Lord God, the Eradicator of suffering, is
        found through the Word of the Shabad. Imbued with devotional worship,
        the mortal remains forever detached. He is honored in the True
        Court of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O mind, remain absorbed in the Mind.
        The mind of the Gurmukh is pleased with the Lord's Name,
        lovingly attuned to the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My God is
        totally Inaccessible and Unfathomable; through the Guru's
        Teachings, He is understood. True self-discipline rests in singing
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, lovingly attuned to the
        Lord.  || 2 ||   He Himself is the Shabad, and He Himself is the
        True Teachings; He merges our light into the Light. The breath
        vibrates through this frail body; the Gurmukh obtains the ambrosial
        nectar.  || 3 ||   He Himself fashions, and He Himself links us
        to our tasks; the True Lord is pervading everywhere. O Nanak,
        without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one is anything. Through
        the Naam,we are blessed with glory.  || 4 || 8 ||   MALAAR,  THIRD
        MEHL:  The mortal is enticed by the poison of corruption, burdened
        with such a heavy load. The Lord has placed the magic spell of
        the Shabad into his mouth, and destroyed the poison of ego.  ||
        1 ||   O mortal, egotism and attachment are such heavy loads of
        pain. This terrifying world-ocean cannot be crossed; through the
        Lord's Name, the Gurmukh crosses over to the other side.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Attachment to the three-phased show of Maya
        pervades all the created forms. In the Sat Sangat, the Society
        of the Saints, the state of supreme awareness is attained. The
        Merciful Lord carries us across.  || 2 ||   The smell of sandalwood
        is so sublime; its fragrance spreads out far and wide. <br>

      <p> The lifestyle of the Lord's humble servant is exalted and

        the world.  || 3 ||   O my Lord and Master, please be merciful,
        merciful to me, that I may enshrine the Lord, Har, Har, Har, within
        my heart. Nanak has found the Perfect True Guru; in his mind,

        detached? How has this mind been gripped by possessiveness?  ||
        1 ||   O Pandit, O religious scholar, reflect on this in your
        mind. Why do you read so many other things, and carry such a heavy
        load?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Creator has attached it to Maya
        and possessiveness. Enforcing His Order, He created the world.
        By Guru's Grace, understand this, O Siblings of Destiny.
        Remain forever in the Sanctuary of the Lord.  || 2 ||   He alone
        is a Pandit, who sheds the load of the three qualities. Night
        and day, he chants the Name of the One Lord. He accepts the Teachings

        the One Lord is within all beings. As he sees the One Lord, he
        knows the One Lord. That person, whom the Lord forgives, is united
        with Him. He finds eternal peace, here and hereafter.  || 4 ||
        Says Nanak, what can anyone do? He alone is liberated, whom
        the Lord blesses with His Grace. Night and day, he sings the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord. Then, he no longer bothers with the proclamations
        of the Shaastras or the Vedas.  || 5 || 1 || 10 ||   MALAAR, 
        THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukhs wander lost in reincarnation,
        confused and deluded by doubt. The Messenger of Death constantly
        beats them and disgraces them. Serving the True Guru, the mortal's
        subservience to Death is ended. He meets the Lord God, and enters
        the Mansion of His Presence.  || 1 ||   O mortal, as Gurmukh,
        meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. In duality, you are
        ruining and wasting this priceless human life. You trade it away
        in exchange for a shell.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Gurmukh falls
        in love with the Lord, by His Grace. He enshrines loving devotion
        to the Lord, Har, Har, deep within his heart. The Word of the
        Shabad carries him across the terrifying world-ocean. He appears
        true in the True Court of the Lord.  || 2 ||   Performing all
        sorts of rituals, they do not find the True Guru. Without the
        Guru, so many wander lost and confused in Maya. Egotism, possessiveness
        and attachment rise up and increase within them. In the love of
        dualty, the self-willed manmukhs suffer in pain.  || 3 ||   The
        Creator Himself is Inaccessible and Infinite. Chant the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad, and earn the true profit. The Lord is
        Independent, Ever-present, here and now. <br>

      <p> O Nanak, the Gurmukh merges in the Naam.  || 4 || 2 || 11 || 
        MALAAR,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who are attached to the Guru's
        Teachings, are Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet alive. They remain
        forever awake and aware night and day, in devotional worship of
        the Lord. They serve the True Guru, and eradicate their self-conceit.
        I fall at the feet of such humble beings.  || 1 ||   Constantly
        singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I live. The Word of
        the Guru's Shabad is such totally sweet elixir. Through
        the Name of the Lord, I have attained the state of liberation.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Attachment to Maya leads to the darkness
        of ignorance. The self-willed manukhs are attached, foolish and
        ignorant. Night and day, their lives pass away in worldly entanglements.
        They die and die again and again, only to be reborn and receive
        their punishment.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukh is lovingly attuned to
        the Name of the Lord. He does not cling to false greed. Whatever
        he does, he does with intuitive poise. He drinks in the sublime
        essence of the Lord; his tongue delights in its flavor.  || 3
        ||   Among millions, hardly any understand. The Lord Himself forgives,
        and bestows His glorious greatness. Whoever meets with the Primal
        Lord God, shall never be separated again. Nanak is absorbed in
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4 || 3 || 12 ||   MALAAR,
        THIRD MEHL:  Everyone speaks the Name of the Lord with the tongue.
        But only by serving the True Guru does the mortal receive the
        Name. His bonds are shattered, and he stays in the house of liberation.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he sits in the eternal,
        unchanging house.  || 1 ||   O my mind, why are you angry? In
        this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name is the source
        of profit. Contemplate and appreciate the Guru's Teachings
        within your heart, night and day.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Each and
        every instant, the sparrow-hawk cries and calls. Without seeing
        her Beloved, she does not sleep at all. She cannot endure this
        separation. When she meets the True Guru, then she intuitively
        meets her Beloved.  || 2 ||   Lacking the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, the mortal suffers and dies. He is burnt in the fire of
        desire, and his hunger does not depart. Without good destiny,
        he cannot find the Naam. He performs all sorts of rituals until
        he is exhausted.  || 3 ||   The mortal thinks about the Vedic
        teachings of the three gunas, the three dispositions. He deals
        in corruption, filth and vice. He dies, only to be reborn; he
        is ruined over and over again. The Gurmukh enshrines the glory
        of the supreme state of celestial peace.  || 4 ||   One who has
        faith in the Guru - everyone has faith in him. Through
        the Guru's Word, the mind is cooled and soothed. Throughout
        the four ages, that humble being is known to be pure. O Nanak,
        that Gurmukh is so rare.  || 5 || 4 || 13 || 9 || 13 || 22 || <br>

        Holy Guru, who night and day keep the Lord enshrined in his heart.
        Seeing the Guru, the GurSikh blossoms forth, like the child seeing
        his mother.  || 3 ||   The soul-bride and the Husband Lord live
        together as one, but the hard wall of egotism has come between

        their sins, the mortals take cleansing baths in them; the rivers'
        pollution is washed away by the dust of the feet of the Holy.
        || 1 ||   Instead of bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage, take your cleansing bath in the Name. When the
        dust of the feet of the Sat Sangat rises up into the eyes, all
        filthy evil-mindedness is removed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Bhaageerat'h
        the penitent brought the Ganges down, and Shiva established Kaydaar.
        Krishna grazed cows in Kaashi; through the humble servant of the
        Lord, these places became famous.  || 2 ||   And all the sacred
        shrines of pilgrimage established by the gods, long for the dust
        of the feet of the Holy. Meeting with the Lord's Saint,

        ||   And all the creatures of Your Universe, O my Lord and Master,
        long for the dust of the feet of the Holy. O Nanak, one who has

        of the feet of the Holy; the Lord carries him across.  || 4 ||

        being who is blessed by the Grace of the Lord. His hunger and
        pain are totally taken away; he chants the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har,
        Har, the mortal is emancipated. One who listens to the Guru's
        Teachings and meditates on them, is carried across the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am the slave of that humble
        being, who is blessed by the Grace of the Lord, Har, Har. Meeting
        with the Lord's humble servant, peace is obtained; all
        the pollution and filth of evil-mindedness is washed away.  ||
        2 ||   The humble servant of the Lord feels hunger only for the
        Lord. He is satisfied only when he chants the Lord's Glories.
        The humble servant of the Lord is a fish in the Water of the Lord.
        Forgetting the Lord, he would dry up and die.  || 3 ||   He alone
        knows this love, who enshrines it within his mind. Servant Nanak
        gazes upon the Lord and is at peace; The hunger of his body is
        totally satisfied.  || 4 || 3 ||   MALAAR,  FOURTH MEHL:  All
        the beings and creatures which God has created - on their
        foreheds, He has written their destiny. The Lord blesses His humble
        servant with glorious greatness. The Lord enjoins him to his tasks.
        || 1 ||   The True Guru implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, within. <br>

      <p> Chant the Name of the Lord, O Sikhs of the Guru, O my Siblings
        of Destiny. Only the Lord will carry you across the terrifying
        world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That humble being who worships,
        adores and serves the Guru is pleasing to my Lord God. To worship
        and adore the True Guru is to serve the Lord. In His Mercy, He
        saves us and carries us across.  || 2 ||   The ignorant and the
        blind wander deluded by doubt; deluded and confused, they pick
        flowers to offer to their idols. They worship lifeless stones
        and serve the tombs of the dead; all their efforts are useless.
        || 3 ||   He alone is said to be the True Guru, who realizes
        God, and proclaims the Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har. Offer the
        Guru sacred foods, clothes, silk and satin robes of all sorts;
        know that He is True. The merits of this shall never leave you
        lacking.  || 4 ||   The Divine True Guru is the Embodiment, the
        Image of the Lord; He utters the Ambrosial Word. O Nanak, blessed
        and good is the destiny of that humble being, who focuses his
        consciousness on the Feet of the Lord.  || 5 || 4 ||   MALAAR,
        FOURTH MEHL:  Those whose hearts are filled with my True Guru
        - those Saints are good and noble in every way. Seeing
        them, my mind blossoms forth in bliss; I am forever a sacrifice
        to them.  || 1 ||   O spiritual teacher, chant the Name of the
        Lord, day and night. All hunger and thirst are satisfied, for
        those who partake of the sublime essence of the Lord, through
        the Guru's Teachings.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The slaves
        of the Lord are our Holy companions. Meeting with them, doubt
        is taken away. As the swan separates the milk from the water,
        the Holy Saint removes the fire of egotism from the body.  ||
        2 ||   Those who do not love the Lord in their hearts are deceitful;
        they continually practice deception. What can anyone give them
        to eat? Whatever they themselves plant, they must eat.  || 3 ||
        This is the Quality of the Lord, and of the Lord's humble
        servants as well; the Lord places His Own Essence within them.
        Blessed, blessed, is Guru Nanak, who looks impartially on all;
        He crosses over and transcends both slander and praise.  || 4
        || 5 ||   MALAAR,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Name of the Lord is inaccessible,
        unfathomable, exalted and sublime. It is chanted by the Lord's
        Grace. By great good fortune, I have found the True Congregation,
        and in the Company of the Holy, I am carried across.  || 1 ||
        My mind is in ecstasy, night and day. By Guru's Grace,
        I chant the Name of the Lord. Doubt and fear are gone from my
        mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who chant and meditate on the
        Lord - O Lord, in Your Mercy, please unite me with them.
        Gazing upon them, I am at peace; the pain and disease of egotism
        are gone.  || 2 ||   Those who meditate on the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord in their hearts - their lives become totally
        fruitful. They themselves swim across, and carry the world across
        with them. Their ancestors and family cross over as well.  ||
        3 ||   You Yourself created the whole world, and You Yourself
        keep it under Your control. </p>
