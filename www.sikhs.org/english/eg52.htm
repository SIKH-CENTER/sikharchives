        <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.</b>
        <p> <b>TRUTH IS THE NAME.</b> </p>
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  NO FEAR.  NO HATRED. </p>
        <p> IMAGE OF THE UNDYING.  BEYOND BIRTH.  SELF-EXISTENT. </p>
        <p> BY GURU'S GRACE: </p>
        <p> RAAG WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> To the addict, there is nothing like the drug; to the fish, there
        is nothing else like water. Those who are attuned to their Lord
        -  everyone is pleasing to them.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        cut apart into pieces, a sacrifice to Your Name, O Lord and Master.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is the fruitful tree; His Name
        is ambrosial nectar. Those who drink it in are satisfied; I am
        a sacrifice to them.  || 2 ||   You are not visible to me, although
        You dwell with everyone. How can the thirst of the thirsty be
        quenched, with that wall between me and the pond?  || 3 ||   Nanak
        is Your merchant; You, O Lord and Master, are my capital. My mind
        is cleared of doubt, when I praise You in prayer.  || 4 || 1 ||
        WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL:  The virtuous bride ravishes and enjoys
        her Husband Lord; why does the unworthy one cry out? If she were
        to become virtuous, then she too could enjoy her Husband Lord.
        || 1 ||   My Husband Lord is loving and playful; why should the
        soul-bride enjoy any other?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If the soul-bride
        does good deeds, and makes her mind the thread, she obtains the
        jewel, which cannot be purchased for any price, strung upon the
        thread of her consciousness.  || 2 ||   I ask, but I do not follow
        the way shown to me; still, I claim to have reached my destination.
        I do not speak with You, O my Husband Lord; how then can I come
        to have a place in Your home?  || 3 ||   O Nanak, without the
        One, there is no other at all. If the soul-bride remains attached
        to You, then she shall enjoy her Husband Lord.  || 4 || 2 || 
        WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:  The peacocks are singing
        sweetly, O sister; the rainy season of Saawan has come. Your beauteous
        eyes are like a string of charms, fascinating and enticing the
        soul-bride. I would cut myself into pieces for the Blessed Vision
        of Your Darshan; I am a sacrifice to Your Name. I take pride in
        You; without You, what could I be proud of? So smash your bracelets
        along with your bed, O soul-bride, and break your arms, along
        with the arms of your couch. </p>
      <p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> In spite of all the decorations which you have made, O soul-bride,
        your Husband Lord is attuned to someone else. You don't have
        the bracelets of gold, nor the good crystal jewelry; you have
        not dealt with the true jeweller. Those arms, which do not embrace
        the neck of the Husband Lord, burn in anguish. All my companions
        have gone to enjoy their Husband Lord; which door should I, the
        wretched one, go to? O friend, I am very well-behaved, but I am
        not pleasing to my Husband Lord at all. I have woven my hair into
        lovely braids, and saturated their partings with vermillion; but
        when I go before Him, I am not accepted, and I die, suffering
        in sorrow. I weep  -  the whole world weeps; even the birds
        of the forest weep with me. The only thing which does not weep
        is my body's sense of separation, which has separated me
        from my Husband Lord. In a dream, He came, and went away again;
        I cried so many tears. I cannot come to You, O my Beloved, and
        I cannot send anyone to You. Come to me, O blessed sleep  - 
        perhaps I will see my Husband Lord again. One who brings me a
        message from my Lord and Master  -  says Nanak, what shall
        I give to Him? Cutting off my head, I give it to Him to sit upon;
        without my head, I shall still serve Him. Why haven't I died?
        Why hasn't my life just ended? My Husband Lord has become
        a stranger to me.  || 1 || 3 || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <center>
        WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> When the mind is filthy, everything is filthy; by washing the
        body, the mind is not cleansed. This world is deluded by doubt;
        hardly anyone understands this.  || 1 ||   O my mind, chant the
        One Name. The True Guru has given me this treasure.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Even if one learns the Yogic postures of the Siddhas,
        and holds his sexual energy in check, still, the filth of the
        mind is not removed, and the filth of egotism is not eliminated.
        || 2 ||   This mind is not controlled by any other discipline,
        except the Sanctuary of the True Guru. Meeting the True Guru,
        one is transformed beyond description.  || 3 ||   Prays Nanak,
        one who dies upon meeting the True Guru, shall be rejuvenated
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The filth of attachment
        and possessiveness shall depart, and the mind shall become pure.
        || 4 || 1 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  By His Grace, one serves
        the True Guru; by His Grace, service is performed. By His grace,
        this mind comes under control; by His Grace, the mind becomes
        pure.  || 1 ||   O my mind, think of the True One. Think of the
        One, and you shall find peace; you shall never suffer in sorrow
        again.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By His Grace, one dies while yet
        alive; by His Grace, the Word of the Shabad comes to dwell in
        the mind. By His Grace, one understands the Hukam of God's
        Command; by His Command, one merges into Him.  || 2 ||   That
        tongue, which does not savor the sublime essence of the Lord  - 
        may that tongue be burned off! It remains attached to other pleasures,
        and through the love of duality, it suffers in pain.  || 3 ||
        The One Lord grants His Grace to all; He Himself makes distinctions. </p>
      <p>
        <center>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, meeting the True Guru, the fruits are obtained, and one
        is blessed with the Glorious Greatness of the Naam.  || 4 || 2
        ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  Emotional attachment to Maya is darkness;
        without the Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom. Those who are
        attached to the Word of the Shabad understand; those in duality
        are ruined.  || 1 ||   O my mind, under Guru's Instruction,
        do good deeds. Dwell forever and ever upon the Lord God, and you
        shall find the gate of galvation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He alone
        is the treasure of virtue; He Himself gives, and then one receives.
        Without the Name, all are separated from Him; through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, one meets Him.  || 2 ||   Acting in
        selfishness and egotism they lose, and nothing comes into their
        hands. But meeting with the True Guru, they find Truth, and merge
        into the True Name.  || 3 ||   Hope and desire abide in this body,
        but the Lord's Light shines within as well. O Nanak, the
        self-willed manmukhs are in bondage, while the Gurmukhs are liberated.
        || 4 || 3 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  The faces of the happy
        soul-brides are radiant forever; through the Guru, they are peacefully
        poised. They constantly enjoy their Husband Lord, eradicating
        self-conceit from within.  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate on the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The True Guru has given me this understanding
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The abandoned brides cry out
        in suffering; they do not attain the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence. In the love of duality, they look ugly; they suffer
        in pain as they go beyond.  || 2 ||   The virtuous soul-bride
        constantly chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord; she enshrines
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within her heart. The unvirtuous
        woman suffers and cries out in pain.  || 3 ||   The One Lord and
        Master is the Husband Lord of all; He cannot be described at all.
        O Nanak, He has separated some from Himself, while others are
        committed to His Name.  || 4 || 4 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:
        The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam always seems sweet; through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I come to taste it. Through
        the True Word of the Guru's Bani, I am absorbed in peace
        and poise; the Dear Lord is enshrined in the mind.  || 1 ||  
        The Lord, granting His Grace, has led me to meet the True Guru.
        Through the Perfect True Guru, I meditate on the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Through Brahma, the hymns of the Vedas were
        revealed, but the love of Maya spread. The wise one, Shiva, pervades
        his own home, but he is engrossed in dark passions and excessive
        egotism.  || 2 ||   Vishnu is always busy reincarnating himself,
        but who will save the world? The Gurmukhs are imbued with spiritual
        wisdom in this age; they are rid of the darkness of emotional
        attachment.  || 3 ||   Serving the True Guru, one is saved; the
        Gurmukh crosses over the world-ocean. The detached renunciates
        are attuned to the True Name; they attain the gate of salvation.
        || 4 ||   The True One is pervading everywhere, deep within;
        He cherishes all. O Nanak, except for the One, I do not know any
        other; He is the Merciful Master of all.  || 5 || 5 ||   WADAHANS,
        THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukh practices true self-discipline, and
        attains the essence of wisdom. The Gurmukh focuses his meditation
        on the True One.  || 1 || </p>

      </p>
      <p> O my mind, become Gurmukh, and remember the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord. It shall stand by you forever, and go along with you.
        || Pause  ||   The True One is the social status and the honor
        of the Gurmukh. Within the Gurmukh is God, his friend and helper.
        || 2 ||   He alone becomes Gurmukh, whom the Lord so blesses.
        He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with greatness.  || 3 ||   The
        Gurmukh lives the True Word of the Shabad, and practices good
        deeds. The Gurmukh, O Nanak, emancipates his family and relations.
        || 4 || 6 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  My tongue is intuitively
        attracted to the taste of the Lord. My mind is satisfied, meditating
        on the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Lasting peace is obtained,
        contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. I am forever a sacrifice
        to my True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My eyes are content, lovingly
        focused on the One Lord. My mind is content, having forsaken the
        love of duality.  || 2 ||   The frame of my body is at peace,
        through the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord. The fragrance of
        the Naam permeates my heart.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, one who has such
        great destiny written upon his forehead, through the Word of the
        Guru's Bani, easily and intuitively becomes free of desire.
        || 4 || 7 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  From the Perfect Guru,
        the Naam is obtained. Through the True Word of the Shabad, one
        merges in the True Lord.  || 1 ||   O my mind, you shall obtain
        the treasure of the Naam, by submitting to the Will of your Guru.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        filth is washed away from within. The immaculate Naam comes to
        abide within the mind.  || 2 ||   Deluded by doubt, the world
        wanders around. It dies, and is born again, ruined by the Messenger
        of Death.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, very fortunate are those who meditate
        on the Name of the Lord. By Guru's Grace, they enshrine the
        Name within their minds.  || 4 || 8 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:
        Egotism is opposed to the Name of the Lord; the two do not dwell
        in the same place. In egotism, selfless service cannot be performed,
        and so the mind goes unfulfilled.  || 1 ||   O my mind, think
        of the Lord, and practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        If you submit to the Hukam of the Lord's Command, you shall
        meet with the Lord, and then egotism will depart from within.
        ||  Pause  ||   Egotism is within all bodies; through egotism,
        we come to be born. Egotism is utter darkness; in egotism, no
        one can understand anything.  || 2 ||   In egotism, devotional
        worship cannot be performed, and the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command cannot be understood. In egotism, the soul is in bondage,
        and the Naam does not come to abide in the mind.  || 3 ||   O
        Nanak, meeting with the True Guru, egotism is eliminated, and
        then, the True One comes to dwell in the mind. Practicing Truth,
        abiding in Truth, and serving Truth, one is absorbed in the True
        One. || 4 || 9 || 12 || </p>

      <p> The Perfect Guru leads me to meet my Beloved; I am a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice to my Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My body is overflowing
        with faults; how can I meet my Perfect Beloved?  || 2 ||   The
        virtuous ones obtain my Beloved; I do not have these virtues.
        How can I meet Him, O my mother?  || 3 ||   I am so tired of making
        all these efforts. Please protect Nanak, the meek one, O my Lord.
        || 4 || 1 ||   WADAHANS,  FOURTH MEHL:  My Lord God is so beautiful,
        but I do not know His value. Abandoning my Lord God, I am entangled
        in duality.  || 1 ||   How can I meet with my Husband? I don't
        know. She who pleases her Husband Lord is a happy soul-bride.
        She meets with her Husband Lord  -  she is so wise.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I am filled with faults; how can I find my Husband
        Lord? You have many loves, but I am not even in Your thoughts,
        O my Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   She who ravishes and enjoys her
        Husband Lord is the good soul-bride. I don't have these virtues;
        what can I, the discarded bride, do?  || 3 ||   The soul-bride
        continually enjoys her Husband Lord forever. I have no good karma;
        will He ever hold me close in His embrace?  || 4 ||   You, O Husband
        Lord, are worthy, while I am unworthy. I am worthless; please
        forgive Nanak, the meek one.  || 5 || 2 || </p>

      <p> Within my mind there is such a great yearning; how will I attain
        the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan? I go and ask my
        True Guru; with the Guru's advice, I shall teach my foolish
        mind. The deluded mind is instructed in the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, and meditates forever on the Lord, Har, Har. O Nanak,
        one whom my Beloved blesses with His Glance of Grace, focuses
        his consciousness on the Lord's Feet.  || 1 ||   I dress
        myself in all sorts of robes for the sake of my Husband, so that
        my True Lord God will be pleased. But my Beloved Husband Lord
        does not even cast a glance in my direction; how can I be consoled?
        For His sake, I adorn myself with adornments, but my Husband is
        imbued with another. O Nanak, blessed, blessed, blessed is that
        soul-bride, who enjoys her True, Sublime Husband Lord.  || 2 ||
        I go and ask the blessed, happy soul-bride, &quot;How did you
        attain Him  -  your Husband Lord, my God?&quot; She answers,
  &quot;My True Husband blessed me with His Glance of Grace; I abandoned
        the distinction between mine and yours. Dedicate everything  - 
        mind, body and soul to the Lord God; this is the way to meet Him,

        heart, but only a few know this. Is there any friend who can rip
        apart the screen of separation? I can only make the effort if
        God is merciful. I sacrifice my body and soul to Him.  || 3 ||
        After wandering around for so long, I have finally come to the
        Saints; all my pains and doubts have been eradicated. God summoned
        me to the Mansion of His Presence, and blessed me with the Ambrosial
        Nectar of His Name. Says Nanak, my God is lofty and exalted. 
        || 4 || 1 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  Blessed is that time, when
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is given; I am a sacrifice to
        the feet of the True Guru.  || 1 ||   You are the Giver of souls,
        O my Beloved God. My mind lives by reflecting upon the Name of
        God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your Mantra is True, and the Word of
        Your Bani is Ambrosial Nectar. Your Presence is cooling and soothing;
        Your gaze is all-knowing.  || 2 ||   Your Command is true; You
        sit upon the eternal throne. My God is eternal; He does not come
        and go.  || 3 ||   You are merciful; I am Your humble servant.
        O Nanak, the Lord and Master is totally permeating and pervading
        everywhere.  || 4 || 2 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are infinite
        -  only a few know this. By Guru's Grace, some come to
        understand You through the Word of the Shabad.  || 1 || </p>

      <p> Your servant offers this prayer, O Beloved: I live by meditating
        on Your Feet, God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O my Merciful Lord God,
        O Great Giver: they alone know, whom You bless with realization.
        || 2 ||   Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to You. Here and
        hereafter, I seek Your Protection.  || 3 ||   I am without virtue;
        I know none of Your Glorious Virtues. O Nanak, seeing the Holy
        Saint, my mind is imbued with You.  || 4 || 3 ||   WADAHANS, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  God is perfect  -  He is the Inner-knower, the
        Searcher of hearts. He blesses us with the gift of the dust of
        the feet of the Holy.  || 1 ||   Please bless me with Your Grace,
        O God, Merciful to the meek. I seek Your Shelter, O Perfect Lord
        of the World.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is totally pervading and
        permeating the water, the land and the sky. He dwells near at
        hand; God is not far away.  || 2 ||   One whom He blesses with
        His Glance of Grace, meditates on Him. Twenty-four hours a day,
        he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 3 ||   God cherishes
        all beings and creatures. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's
        Door.  || 4 || 4 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are the Great
        Giver, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. God, the Perfect
        Lord and Master, is permeating and pervading in all.  || 1 ||
        The Name of my Beloved God is my only support. I live by hearing,
        continually hearing Your Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I seek Your
        Sanctuary, O my Perfect True Guru. My mind is purified by the
        dust of the Saints.  || 2 ||   I have enshrined His Lotus Feet
        within my heart. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your
        Darshan.  || 3 ||   Grant Your Grace, that I may sing Your Glorious
        Praises. O Nanak, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I find
        peace.  || 4 || 5 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the
        Lord. The soul does not die; it ever wastes away.  || 1 ||   By
        great good fortune, one meets the Perfect Guru. By Guru's
        Grace, one meditates on God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is
        the jewel, the pearl, the gem, the diamond. Meditating, meditating
        in remembrance on God, I am enraptured.  || 2 ||   Wherever I
        look, I see the Sanctuary of the Holy. Singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, my mind becomes immaculate and pure.  || 3 ||   Deep
        within the nucleus of each and every heart, my Lord and Master
        dwells. O Nanak, one obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord, when
        God grants His Grace.  || 4 || 6 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        Do not forget me, O God, Merciful to the meek. I seek Your Sanctuary,
        O Perfect, Compassionate Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Wherever
        You come to mind, that place is blessed. The moment I forget You,
        I am stricken with regret.  || 1 ||   All beings are Yours; You
        are their constant companion. Please, give me Your hand, and lift
        me up, out of this world-ocean.  || 2 ||   Coming and going are
        by Your making. One whom You save is not afflicted with suffering.
        || 3 ||   You are the One Lord and Master; there is no other
        at all. Nanak offers this prayer with his palms pressed together.
        || 4 || 7 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  When You allow Yourself
        to be known, then we know You. We chant Your Name, which You have
        given to us.  || 1 || </p>

      </center>
      <p> Deep within my inner being, is the longing to meet my Beloved;
        how can I find the Perfect Guru? Even though a baby may play hundreds
        of games, he cannot survive without milk. The hunger deep within
        me is not satisfied, O my friend, even though I am served hundreds
        of dishes. My mind and body are filled with love for my Beloved;
        how can my mind be comforted, without the Blessed Vision of His
        Darshan?  || 1 ||   Listen, O my dear friends and Siblings of
        Destiny  -  lead me to my True Friend, the Giver of peace.
        He knows all the troubles of my soul; every day, he tells me stories
        of the Lord. I cannot survive without Him, even for an instant.
        I cry out for Him, as the song-bird cries for water. Which of
        Your Excellent Virtues should I contemplate? You save even worthless
        beings like me.  || 2 ||   I have become sad and depressed, longing
        for my Husband Lord, O my friend; when will I see my Husband with
        my eyes? I have forgotten how to enjoy all pleasures; without
        my Husband Lord, they are of no use at all. These clothes do not
        bring my body any pleasure; I cannot dress myself. I bow to those
        friends of mine, who have enjoyed their Beloved Husband Lord.
        || 3 ||   I have adorned myself with all sorts of decorations,
        O my friend, but without my Husband Lord, they are of no use at
        all. When my Husband does not care for me, O my friend, then my
        youth passes away, totally useless. Blessed, blessed are the happy
        soul-brides, O my friend, who are immersed in their Husband Lord.
        I am a sacrifice to those happy soul-brides, O my friend; I wash
        their feet forever.  || 4 ||   As long as I suffered from duality
        and doubt, O my friend, I thought that God was far away. But when
        I met the Perfect True Guru, O my friend, then all my hopes and
        desires were fulfilled. I have obtained all pleasures and comforts,
        O my friend; my Husband Lord is all-pervading everywhere. Servant
        Nanak enjoys the Lord's Love, O my friend; I fall at the
        feet of the Guru, the True Guru.  || 5 || 1 || 9 || </p>

      </center>
      <p> True is the Bani of His Word, and True is the melody; True is
        contemplative meditation on the Word of the Shabad. Night and
        day, I praise the True Lord. Blessed, blessed is my great good
        fortune.  || 1 ||   O my mind, be a sacrifice to the True Name. </p>

      <p> Become the slave of the Lord's slaves, and you shall obtain
        the True Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   True is the tongue which
        is imbued with Truth, and true are the mind and body. By praising
        any other than the True Lord, one's whole life is wasted.
        || 2 ||   Let Truth be the farm, Truth the seed, and Truth the
        merchandise you trade. Night and day, earn the profit of the True
        Name; you shall have treasures overflowing with the wealth of
        devotional worship.  || 3 ||   Let Truth be your food, and let
        Truth be your clothes; let your True Support be the Name of the
        Lord. One who is so blessed receives it, and obtains a seat in
        the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.  || 4 ||   In Truth we
        come, and in Truth we go, and then we are not consigned to reincarnation
        again. The Gurmukhs are recognized as True in the True Court;
        they merge in the True Lord.  || 5 ||   Deep within they are True,
        and their minds are True; they sing the Glorious Praises of the
        True Lord. In the true place, they praise the True One; I am a
        sacrifice to the True Guru.  || 6 ||   True is the time, and true
        is the moment, when one falls in love with the True Lord. Then,
        he sees Truth, and speaks the Truth; he realizes the True Lord
        throughout the entire Creation.  || 7 ||   O Nanak, one merges
        with the True Lord, when He merges with Himself. As it pleases
        Him, He preserves us; He Himself ordains His Will.  || 8 || 1
        ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  The mind wanders in the ten directions
        -  how can one sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord? It is
        totally engrossed in sensuality, constantly tormented by sexual
        desire and anger.  || 1 ||   Waaho! Waaho! Hail! Hail! Chant His
        Glorious Praise. The Lord's Name is so difficult to obtain
        in this age; under Guru's Instruction, drink in the subtle
        essence of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Remembering the Word
        of the Shabad, the mind becomes immaculate, and then one sings
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Under Guru's Instruction,
        one comes to understand his own self, and then he comes to dwell
        in the home of his heart.  || 2 ||   O my mind, be imbued forever
        with the Lord's Love, and sing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord forever. The Immaculate Lord is forever the Giver of peace;
        from Him, one receives the fruits of the mind's desires.
        || 3 ||   I am lowly, but I have been exalted, entering the Sanctuary
        of the Lord. He has lifted up the sinking stone; True is His glorious
        greatness.  || 4 ||   From poison, I have been transformed into
        Ambrosial Nectar; under Guru's Instruction, I have obtained
        wisdom. From bitter herbs, I have been transformed into sandalwood;
        this fragrance permeates deep within my being.  || 5 ||   This
        human birth is very precious; one must earn the right to come
        into the world. By perfect destiny, I met the True Guru; I meditate
        on the Name of the Lord.  || 6 ||   The self-willed manmukhs are
        deluded; attached to corruption, they waste away their lives in
        vain. The Name of the Lord is forever an ocean of peace, but the
        manmukhs do not love the True Word of the Shabad.  || 7 ||   Everyone
        can chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har with their mouths, but
        only a few enshrine it within their hearts. O Nanak, those who
        enshrine the Lord within their hearts, attain liberation and emancipation.

        WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL,  CHHANT:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Why bother to wash the body which is polluted by falsehood? One's
        cleansing bath is only approved, if one practices Truth. </p>

      <p> When there is Truth deep within, then one becomes True, and obtains
        the True Lord. Without pre-ordained destiny, awareness is not
        attained; talking and babbling, one's life is wasted away.
        Wherever you go and sit, speak well, and write the Word of the
        Shabad in your awareness. Why bother to wash the body which is
        polluted by falsehood?  || 1 ||   When I spoke, I spoke as You
        made me speak. The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is pleasing to my
        mind. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, seems so sweet to my mind;
        it has destroyed the house of pain. Peace came to dwell in my
        mind, when You gave the Order. It is Yours to grant Your Grace,
        and it is mine to speak this prayer; You created Yourself. When
        I spoke, I spoke as You made me speak.  || 2 ||   The Lord and
        Master gives us our turn, according to the deeds we have done.
        Don't speak ill of others, or get involved in arguments.
        Don't get into arguments with your Lord and Master  - 
        you shall only ruin yourself. If you challenge the One, with whom
        you must abide, you will only cry in the end. Accept and endure
        what God gives you; tell your mind not to complain in vain. The
        Lord and Master gives us our turn, according to the deeds we have
        done.  || 3 ||   He Himself created all, and He blesses them with
        His Glance of Grace. No one asks for that which is bitter; everyone
        asks for sweets. Let everyone ask for sweets and see that it is
        as the Lord and Master wills. Giving donations to charity and
        performing various religious rituals are not equal to contemplation
        of the Naam. O Nanak, those who are blessed with the Naam have
        such karma pre-ordained. He Himself created all, and He blesses
        them with His Glance of Grace.  || 4 || 1 ||   WADAHANS,  FIRST
        MEHL:  Show mercy to me, that I may chant Your Name. You Yourself
        created all, and You are permeating all. You Yourself are permeating
        all, and You enjoin them to their tasks. Some, You have made kings,
        while others wander around begging. You have made greed and emotional
        attachment seem sweet; they are deluded by this delusion. Be forever
        merciful to me; only then can I chant Your Name.  || 1 ||   Your
        Name is True, and forever pleasing to my mind. My pain is dispelled,
        and I am permeated with peace. The angels, the mortal beings,
        the wise and the enlightened sing of You. The angels, the mortal
        beings, the wise and the enlightened sing of You; they are pleasing
        to Your Mind. Enticed by Maya, they do not remember; they waste
        away their lives in vain. Some fools and idiots never remember;
        whoever has come, shall have to go. Your Name is forever True,
        and pleasing to my mind.  || 2 ||   Beauteous and blessed is Your
        time; the Bani of Your Word is Ambrosial Nectar. Your servants
        serve You with love; these mortals are attached to Your taste.
        Those mortals are attached to Your taste, who are blessed with
        the Ambrosial Name. Those who are attuned to Your Name prosper
        more and more, day by day. Some do not practice good deeds or
        live righteously; they do not practice self-discipline, and they
        do not realize the One. Forever blessed and beauteous is Your
        time; the Bani of Your Word is Ambrosial Nectar.  || 3 || </p>

        Your rule is eternal and unchanging; it shall never come to an
        end. He alone becomes Your servant, who contemplates You in peaceful
        ease. Enemies and pain shall never touch him, and sin shall never
        come close to him. I am forever a sacrifice to the One Lord, and
        Your Name.  || 4 ||   Throughout the ages, Your devotees sing
        Your Praises, O Lord Master, at Your Door. They meditate on the
        One True Lord. They meditate on the True Lord, when they enshrine
        Him in their minds. Doubt and delusion are Your making; when these
        are dispelled, then, by Guru's Grace, You grant Your Grace,
        and save them from the noose of Death. Throughout the ages, they
        are Your devotees.  || 5 ||   O my Great Lord and Master, You
        are unknowable and infinite. How should I make and offer my prayer?
        I do not know what to say. If You bless me with Your Glance of
        Grace, then I realize the Truth. I come to realize the Truth,
        when You Yourself instruct me. The pain and hunger of the world
        are Your making; please eradicate this skepticism. Prays Nanak,
        skepticism is taken away, when one understands the Guru's
        wisdom. The Great Lord and Master is unknowable and infinite.
        || 6 ||   Your eyes are beautiful, and Your teeth are delightful.
        Your nose is graceful, and Your hair is so long. Your body is
        precious, cast in gold. His body is cast in gold, and He wears
        Krishna's mala; meditate on Him, O sisters. You shall not
        have to stand at Death's door, O sisters, if you listen to
        these teachings. From a crane, you shall be transformed into a
        swan, and the filth of your mind shall be removed. Your eyes are
        beautiful, and Your teeth are delightful.  || 7 ||   Your walk
        is graceful, and Your speech is sweet. You coo like a songbird,
        and your youthful beauty is alluring. Your youthful beauty is
        so alluring; it pleases You and fulfills the mind's desires.
        Like an elephant, You step with Your Feet so carefully; You are
        pleased with Yourself. She who is imbued with the Love of such
        a Great Lord, flows intoxicated, like the waters of the Ganges.
        Prays Nanak, I am Your slave, O Lord; Your walk is graceful, and
        Your speech is sweet.  || 8 || 2 || </p>

        bride with Himself; the True King embellishes her.  || 1 ||
