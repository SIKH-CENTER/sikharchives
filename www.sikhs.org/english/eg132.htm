      <p> Kabeer, it is good that I feel the Fear of God; I have forgotten
        everything else. The hail-stone has melted into water, and flowed
        into the ocean.  || 177 ||   Kabeer, the body is a pile of dust,
        collected and packed together. It is a show which lasts for only
        a few days, and then dust returns to dust.  || 178 ||   Kabeer,
        bodies are like the rising and setting of the sun and the moon.
        Without meeting the Guru, the Lord of the Universe, they are all
        reduced to dust again.  || 179 ||   Where the Fearless Lord is,
        there is no fear; where there is fear, the Lord is not there.
        Kabeer speaks after careful consideration; hear this, O Saints,
        in your minds.  || 180 ||   Kabeer, those who do not know anything,
        pass their lives in peaceful sleep. But I have understood the
        riddle; I am faced with all sorts of troubles.  || 181 ||   Kabeer,
        those who are beaten cry a lot; but the cries of the pain of separation
        are different. Struck by the Mystery of God, Kabeer remains silent.
        || 182 ||   Kabeer, the stroke of a lance is easy to bear; it
        takes away the breath. But one who endures the stroke of the Word
        of the Shabad is the Guru, and I am his slave.  || 183 ||   Kabeer:
        O Mullah, why do you climb to the top of the minaret? The Lord
        is not hard of hearing. Look within your own heart for the One,
        for whose sake you shout your prayers.  || 184 ||   Why does the
        Shaykh bother to go on pilgrimage to Mecca, if he is not content
        with himself? Kabeer, one whose heart is not healthy and whole
        - how can he attain his Lord?  || 185 ||   Kabeer, worship
        the Lord Allah; meditating in remembrance on Him, troubles and
        pains depart. The Lord shall be revealed within your own heart,
        and the burning fire within shall be extinguished by His Name.
        || 186 ||   Kabeer, to use force is tyranny, even if you call
        it legal. When your account is called for in the Court of the
        Lord, what will your condition be then?  || 187 ||   Kabeer, the
        dinner of beans and rice is excellent, if it is flavored with
        salt. Who would cut his throat, to have meat with his bread? 
        || 188 ||   Kabeer, one is known to have been touched by the Guru,
        only when his emotional attachment and physical illnesses are
        eradicated. He is not burned by pleasure or pain, and so he becomes
        the Lord Himself.  || 189 ||   Kabeer, it does make a difference,
        how you chant the Lord's Name, 'Raam'. This
        is something to consider. Everyone uses the same word for the
        son of Dasrath and the Wondrous Lord.  || 190 ||   Kabeer, use
        the word 'Raam', only to speak of the All-pervading
        Lord. You must make that distinction. One 'Raam' is
        pervading everywhere, while the other is contained only in himself.
        || 191 ||   Kabeer, those houses in which neither the Holy nor
        the Lord are served - those houses are like cremation grounds;
        demons dwell within them.  || 192 ||   Kabeer, I have become mute,
        insane and deaf. I am crippled - the True Guru has pierced
        me with His Arrow.  || 193 ||   Kabeer, the True Guru, the Spiritual
        Warrior, has shot me with His Arrow. As soon as it struck me,
        I fell to the ground, with a hole in my heart.  || 194 || <br>

      <p> Kabeer, the pure drop of water falls from the sky, onto the dirty
        ground. You must acknowledge this, that without the Sangat, the
        Holy Congregation, it turns into burnt ashes.  || 195 ||   Kabeer,
        the pure drop of water falls from the sky, and mixes with the
        dust. Millions of clever people may try, but they will fail -
        it cannot be made separate again.  || 196 ||   Kabeer, I was going
        on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and God met me on the way. He scolded
        me and asked, &quot;Who told you that I am only there?&quot;
        || 197 ||   Kabeer, I went to Mecca - how many times,
        Kabeer? O Lord, what is the problem with me? You have not spoken
        to me with Your Mouth.  || 198 ||   Kabeer, they oppress living
        beings and kill them, and call it proper. When the Lord calls
        for their account, what will their condition be?  || 199 ||  
        Kabeer, it is tyranny to use force; the Lord shall call you to
        account. When your account is called for, your face and mouth
        shall be beaten.  || 200 ||   Kabeer, it is easy to render your
        account, if your heart is pure. In the True Court of the Lord,
        no one will seize you.  || 201 ||   Kabeer: O duality, you are
        mighty and powerful in the earth and the sky. The six Shaastras
        and the eighty-four Siddhas are entrenched in skepticism.  ||
        202 ||   Kabeer, nothing is mine within myself. Whatever there
        is, is Yours, O Lord. If I surrender to You what is already Yours,
        what does it cost me?  || 203 ||   Kabeer, repeating, &quot;You,
        You&quot;, I have become like You. Nothing of me remains in myself.
        When the difference between myself and others is removed, then
        wherever I look, I see only You.  || 204 ||   Kabeer, those who
        think of evil and entertain false hopes - none of their
        desires shall be fulfilled; they shall depart in despair.  ||
        205 ||   Kabeer, whoever meditates in remembrance on the Lord,
        he alone is happy in this world. One who is protected and saved
        by the Creator Lord, shall never waver, here or hereafter.  ||
        206 ||   Kabeer, I was being crushed like sesame seeds in the
        oil-press, but the True Guru saved me. My pre-ordained primal
        destiny has now been revealed.  || 207 ||   Kabeer, my days have
        passed, and I have postponed my payments; the interest on my account
        continues to increase. I have not meditated on the Lord and my
        account is still pending, and now, the moment of my death has
        come!  || 208 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Kabeer, the mortal is a barking
        dog, chasing after a carcass. By the Grace of good karma, I have
        found the True Guru, who has saved me.  || 209 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        Kabeer, the earth belongs to the Holy, but it is being occupied
        by thieves. They are not a burden to the earth; they receive its
        blessings.  || 210 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Kabeer, the rice is beaten
        with a mallet to get rid of the husk. When people sit in evil
        company, the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls them to account.
        || 211 ||   Trilochan says, O Naam Dayv, Maya has enticed you,
        my friend. Why are you printing designs on these sheets, and not
        focusing your consciousness on the Lord?  || 212 || <br>
      </p>

          <a name="p1376" id="p1376"><b>Page 1376</b></a><br>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Naam Dayv answers, O Trilochan, chant the Lord's Name with
        your mouth. With your hands and feet, do all your work, but let
        your consciousness remain with the Immaculate Lord.  || 213 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  Kabeer, no one belongs to me, and I belong to no
        one else. The One who created the creation - into Him I
        shall be absorbed.  || 214 ||   Kabeer, the flour has fallen into
        the mud; nothing has come into my hands. That which was eaten
        while it was being ground - that alone is of any use. 
        || 215 ||   Kabeer, the mortal knows everything, and knowing,
        he still makes mistakes. What good is a lamp in one's hand,
        if he falls into the well?  || 216 ||   Kabeer, I am in love with
        the All-knowing Lord; the ignorant ones try to hold me back. How
        could I ever break with the One, who owns our soul and breath
        of life.  || 217 ||   Kabeer, why kill yourself for your love
        of decorations of your home and mansion? In the end, only six
        feet, or a little more, shall be your lot.  || 218 ||   Kabeer,
        whatever I wish for does not happen. What can I accomplish by
        merely thinking? The Lord does whatever He wishes; it is not up
        to me at all.  || 219 ||   THIRD MEHL:  God Himself makes the
        mortals anxious, and He Himself takes the anxiety away. O Nanak,
        praise the One, who takes care of all.  || 220 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        Kabeer, the mortal does not remember the Lord; he wanders around,
        engrossed in greed. Committing sins, he dies, and his life ends
        in an instant.  || 221 ||   Kabeer, the body is like a clay vessel
        or a brittle metal pot. If you wish to keep it safe and sound,
        then vibrate and meditate on the Lord; otherwise, the thing shall
        break.  || 222 ||   Kabeer, chant the Name of the Beautifully-haired
        Lord; do not sleep unaware. Chanting His Name night and day, the
        Lord will eventually hear your call.  || 223 ||   Kabeer, the
        body is a banana forest, and the mind is an intoxicated elephant.
        The jewel of spiritual wisdom is the prod, and the rare Saint
        is the rider.  || 224 ||   Kabeer, the Lord's Name is the
        jewel, and the mouth is the purse; open this purse to the Appraiser.
        If a buyer can be found, it will go for a high price.  || 225
        ||   Kabeer, the mortal does not know the Lord's Name,
        but he has raised a very large family. He dies in the midst of
        his worldly affairs, and then he is not heard in the external
        world.  || 226 ||   Kabeer, in the blink of an eye, moment by
        moment, life is passing by. The mortal does not give up his worldly
        entanglements; the Messenger of Death walks in and beats the drum.
        || 227 ||   Kabeer, the Lord is the tree, and disillusionment
        with the world is the fruit. The Holy man, who has abandoned useless
        arguments, is the shade of the tree.  || 228 ||   Kabeer, plant
        the seeds of such a plant, which shall bear fruit throughout the
        twelve months, with cooling shade and abundant fruit, upon which
        birds joyously play.  || 229 ||   Kabeer, the Great Giver is the
        tree, which blesses all with the fruit of compassion. When the
        birds migrate to other lands, O Tree, you bear the fruits.  ||
        230 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> Kabeer, the mortal finds the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, if he has such destiny written upon his forehead. He obtains
        the treasure of liberation, and the difficult road to the Lord
        is not blocked.  || 231 ||   Kabeer, whether is is for an hour,
        half an hour, or half of that, whatever it is, it is worthwhile
        to speak with the Holy.  || 232 ||   Kabeer, those mortals who
        consume marijuana, fish and wine - no matter what pilgrimages,
        fasts and rituals they follow, they will all go to hell.  || 233
        ||   Kabeer, I keep my eyes lowered, and enshrine my Friend within
        my heart. I enjoy all pleasures with my Beloved, but I do not
        let anyone else know.  || 234 ||   Twenty-four hours a day, every
        hour, my soul continues to look to You, O Lord. Why should I keep
        my eyes lowered? I see my Beloved in every heart.  || 235 || 
        Listen, O my companions: my soul dwells in my Beloved, and my
        Beloved dwells in my soul. I realize that there is no difference
        between my soul and my Beloved; I cannot tell whether my soul
        or my Beloved dwells in my heart.  || 236 ||   Kabeer, the Brahmin
        may be the guru of the world, but he is not the Guru of the devotees.
        He rots and dies in the perplexities of the four Vedas.  || 237
        ||   The Lord is like sugar, scattered in the sand; the elephant
        cannot pick it up. Says Kabeer, the Guru has given me this sublime
        understanding: become an ant, and feed on it.  || 238 ||   Kabeer,
        if you desire to play the game of love with the Lord, then cut
        off your head, and make it into a ball. Lose yourself in the play
        of it, and then whatever will be, will be.  || 239 ||   Kabeer,
        if you desire to play the game of love with the Lord, play it
        with someone with committment. Pressing the unripe mustard seeds
        produces neither oil nor flour.  || 240 ||   Searching, the mortal
        stumbles like a blind person, and does not recognize the Saint.
        Says Naam Dayv, how can one obtain the Lord God, without His devotee?
        || 241 ||   Forsaking the Diamond of the Lord, the mortals put
        their hopes in another. Those people shall go to hell; Ravi Daas
        speaks the Truth.  || 242 ||   Kabeer, if you live the householder's
        life, then practice righteousness; otherwise, you might as well
        retire from the world. If someone renounces the world, and then
        gets involved in worldly entanglements, he shall suffer terrible
        misfortune.  || 243 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The day of the bride's wedding is pre-ordained.
        On that day, the Messenger of Death, of whom she had only heard,
        comes and shows its face. It breaks the bones of the body and
        pulls the helpless soul out. That pre-ordained time of marriage
        cannot be avoided. Explain this to your soul. The soul is the
        bride, and death is the groom. He will marry her and take her
        away. After the body sends her away with its own hands, whose
        neck will it embrace? The bridge to hell is narrower than a hair;
        haven't you heard of it with your ears? Fareed, the call
        has come; be careful now - don't let yourself be
        robbed.  || 1 ||   Fareed, it is so difficult to become a humble
        Saint at the Lord's Door. I am so accustomed to walking
        in the ways of the world. <br>

      <p> I have tied and picked up the bundle; where can I go to throw
        it away?  || 2 ||   I know nothing; I understand nothing. The
        world is a smouldering fire. My Lord did well to warn me about
        it; otherwise, I would have been burnt as well.  || 3 ||   Fareed,
        if I had known that I had so few sesame seeds, I would have been
        more careful with them in my hands. If I had known that my Husband
        Lord was so young and innocent, I would not have been so arrogant.
        || 4 ||   If I had known that my robe would come loose, I would
        have tied a tighter knot. I have found none as great as You, Lord;
        I have looked and searched throughout the world.  || 5 ||   Fareed,
        if you have a keen understanding, then do not write black marks
        against anyone else. Look underneath your own collar instead.
        || 6 ||   Fareed, do not turn around and strike those who strike
        you with their fists. Kiss their feet, and return to your own
        home.  || 7 ||   Fareed, when there was time for you to earn good
        karma, you were in love with the world instead. Now, death has
        a strong foothold; when the load is full, it is taken away.  ||
        8 ||   See, Fareed, what has happened: your beard has become grey.
        That which is coming is near, and the past is left far behind.
        || 9 ||   See, Fareed, what has happened: sugar has become poison.
        Without my Lord, who can I tell of my sorrow?  || 10 ||   Fareed,
        my eyes have become weak, and my ears have become hard of hearing.
        The body's crop has become ripe and turned color.  || 11
        ||   Fareed, those who did not enjoy their Spouse when their hair
        was black - hardly any of them enjoy Him when their hair
        turns grey. So be in love with the Lord, so that your color may
        ever be new.  || 12 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Fareed, whether one's
        hair is black or grey, our Lord and Master is always here if one
        remembers Him. This loving devotion to the Lord does not come
        by one's own efforts, even though all may long for it.
        This cup of loving devotion belongs to our Lord and Master; He
        gives it to whomever He likes.  || 13 ||   Fareed, those eyes
        which have enticed the world - I have seen those eyes.
        Once, they could not endure even a bit of mascara; now, the birds
        hatch their young in them!  || 14 ||   Fareed, they shouted and
        yelled, and constantly gave good advice. But those whom the devil
        has spoiled - how can they turn their consciousness towards
        God?  || 15 ||   Fareed, become the grass on the path, if you
        long for the Lord of all. One will cut you down, and another will
        trample you underfoot; then, you shall enter the Court of the
        Lord.  || 16 ||   Fareed, do not slander the dust; noting is as
        great as dust. When we are alive, it is under our feet, and when
        we are dead, it is above us.  || 17 ||   Fareed, when there is
        greed, what love can there be? When there is greed, love is false.
        How long can one remain in a thatched hut which leaks when it
        rains?  || 18 ||   Fareed, why do you wander from jungle to jungle,
        crashing through the thorny trees? The Lord abides in the heart;
        why are you looking for Him in the jungle?  || 19 ||   Fareed,
        with these small legs, I crossed deserts and mountains. But today,
        Fareed, my water jug seems hundreds of miles away.  || 20 || <br>

      <p> Fareed, the nights are long, and my sides are aching in pain.
        Cursed are the lives of those who place their hopes in others.
        || 21 ||   Fareed, if I had been there when my friend came, I
        would have made myself a sacrifice to him. Now my flesh is burning
        red on the hot coals.  || 22 ||   Fareed, the farmer plants acacia
        trees, and wishes for grapes. He is spinning wool, but he wishes
        to wear silk.  || 23 ||   Fareed, the path is muddy, and the house
        of my Beloved is so far away. If I go out, my blanket will get
        soaked, but if I remain at home, then my heart will be broken.
        || 24 ||   My blanket is soaked, drenched with the downpour of
        the Lord's Rain. I am going out to meet my Friend, so that
        my heart will not be broken.  || 25 ||   Fareed, I was worried
        that my turban might become dirty. My thoughtless self did not
        realize that one day, dust will consume my head as well.  || 26
        ||   Fareed: sugar cane, candy, sugar, molasses, honey and buffalo's
        milk - all these things are sweet, but they are not equal
        to You.  || 27 ||   Fareed, my bread is made of wood, and hunger
        is my appetizer. Those who eat buttered bread, will suffer in
        terrible pain.  || 28 ||   Eat dry bread, and drink cold water.
        Fareed, if you see someone else's buttered bread, do not
        envy him for it.  || 29 ||   This night, I did not sleep with
        my Husband Lord, and now my body is suffering in pain. Go and
        ask the deserted bride, how she passes her night.  || 30 ||  
        She finds no place of rest in her father-in-law's home,
        and no place in her parents' home either. Her Husband Lord
        does not care for her; what sort of a blessed, happy soul-bride
        is she?  || 31 ||   In her father-in-law's home hereafter,
        and in her parents' home in this world, she belongs to
        her Husband Lord. Her Husband is Inaccessible and Unfathomable.
        O Nanak, she is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to her Carefree
        Lord.  || 32 ||   Bathing, washing and decorating herself, she
        comes and sleeps without anxiety. Fareed, she still smells like
        asafoetida; the fragrance of musk is gone.  || 33 ||   I am not
        afraid of losing my youth, as long as I do not lose the Love of
        my Husband Lord. Fareed, so many youths, without His Love, have
        dried up and withered away.  || 34 ||   Fareed, anxiety is my
        bed, pain is my mattress, and the pain of separation is my blanket
        and quilt. Behold, this is my life, O my True Lord and Master.
        || 35 ||   Many talk of the pain and suffering of separation;
        O pain, you are the ruler of all. Fareed, that body, within which
        love of the Lord does not well up - look upon that body
        as a cremation ground.  || 36 ||   Fareed, these are poisonous
        sprouts coated with sugar. Some die planting them, and some are
        ruined, harvesting and enjoying them.  || 37 ||   Fareed, the
        hours of the day are lost wandering around, and the hours of the
        night are lost in sleep. God will call for your account, and ask
        you why you came into this world.  || 38 ||   Fareed, you have
        gone to the Lord's Door. Have you seen the gong there?
        This blameless object is being beaten - imagine what is
        in store for us sinners!  || 39 ||   Each and every hour, it is
        beaten; it is punished every day. This beautiful body is like
        the gong; it passes the night in pain.  || 40 || <br>

      <p> Shaykh Fareed has grown old, and his body has begun to tremble.
        Even if he could live for hundreds of years, his body will eventually
        turn to dust.  || 41 ||   Fareed begs, O Lord, do not make me
        sit at another's door. If this is the way you are going
        to keep me, then go ahead and take the life out of my body.  ||
        42 ||   With the axe on his shoulder, and a bucket on his head,
        the blacksmith is ready to cut down the tree. Fareed, I long for
        my Lord; you long only for the charcoal.  || 43 ||   Fareed, some
        have lots of flour, while others do not even have salt. When they
        go beyond this world, it shall be seen, who will be punished.
        || 44 ||   Drums were beaten in their honor, there were canopies
        above their heads, and bugles announced their coming. They have
        gone to sleep in the cemetary, buried like poor orphans.  || 45
        ||   Fareed, those who built houses, mansions and lofty buildings,
        are also gone. They made false deals, and were dropped into their
        graves.  || 46 ||   Fareed, there are many seams on the patched
        coat, but there are no seams on the soul. The shaykhs and their
        disciples have all departed, each in his own turn.  || 47 || 
        Fareed, the two lamps are lit, but death has come anyway. It
        has captured the fortress of the body, and plundered the home
        of the heart; it extinguishes the lamps and departs.  || 48 ||
        Fareed, look at what has happened to the cotton and the sesame
        seed, the sugar cane and paper, the clay pots and the charcoal.
        This is the punishment for those who do evil deeds.  || 49 ||
        Fareed, you wear your prayer shawl on your shoulders and the
        robes of a Sufi; your words are sweet, but there is a dagger in
        your heart. Outwardly, you look bright, but your heart is dark
        as night.  || 50 ||   Fareed, not even a drop of blood would issue
        forth, if someone cut my body. Those bodies which are imbued with
        the Lord - those bodies contain no blood.  || 51 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  This body is all blood; without blood, this body could
        not exist. Those who are imbued with their Lord, do not have the
        blood of greed in their bodies. When the Fear of God fills the
        body, it becomes thin; the blood of greed departs from within.
        Just as metal is purified by fire, the Fear of God removes the
        filthy residues of evil-mindedness. O Nanak, those humble beings
        are beautiful, who are imbued with the Lord's Love.  ||
        52 ||   Fareed, seek that sacred pool, in which the genuine article
        is found. Why do you bother to search in the pond? Your hand will
        only sink into the mud.  || 53 ||   Fareed, when she is young,
        she does not enjoy her Husband. When she grows up, she dies. Lying
        in the grave, the soul-bride cries, &quot;I did not meet You,
        my Lord.&quot;  || 54 ||   Fareed, your hair has turned grey,
        your beard has turned grey, and your moustache has turned grey.
        O my thoughtless and insane mind, why are you indulging in pleasures?
        || 55 ||   Fareed, how long can you run on the rooftop? You are
        asleep to your Husband Lord - give it up! The days which
        were allotted to you are numbered, and they are passing, passing
        away.  || 56 ||   Fareed, houses, mansions and balconies -
        do not attach your consciousness to these. When these collapse
        into heaps of dust, none of them will be your friend.  || 57 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> Fareed, do not focus on mansions and wealth; center your consciousness
        on death, your powerful enemy. Remember that place where you must
        go.  || 58 ||   Fareed, those deeds which do not bring merit -
        forget about those deeds. Otherwise, you shall be put to shame,
        in the Court of the Lord.  || 59 ||   Fareed, work for your Lord
        and Master; dispel the doubts of your heart. The dervishes, the
        humble devotees, have the patient endurance of trees.  || 60 ||
        Fareed, my clothes are black, and my outfit is black. I wander
        around full of sins, and yet people call me a dervish -
        a holy man.  || 61 ||   The crop which is burnt will not bloom,
        even if it is soaked in water. Fareed, she who is forsaken by
        her Husband Lord, grieves and laments.  || 62 ||   When she is
        a virgin, she is full of desire; but when she is married, then
        her troubles begin. Fareed, she has this one regret, that she
        cannot be a virgin again.  || 63 ||   The swans have landed in
        a small pond of salt water. They dip in their bills, but do not
        drink; they fly away, still thirsty.  || 64 ||   The swans fly
        away, and land in the fields of grain. The people go to chase
        them away. The thoughtless people do not know, that the swans
        do not eat the grain.  || 65 ||   The birds which lived in the
        pools have flown away and left. Fareed, the overflowing pool shall
        also pass away, and only the lotus flowers shall remain.  || 66
        ||   Fareed, a stone will be your pillow, and the earth will be
        your bed. The worms shall eat into your flesh. Countless ages
        will pass, and you will still be lying on one side.  || 67 ||
        Fareed, your beautiful body shall break apart, and the subtle
        thread of the breath shall be snapped. In which house will the
        Messenger of Death be a guest today?  || 68 ||   Fareed, your
        beautiful body shall break apart, and the subtle thread of the
        breath shall be snapped. Those friends who were a burden on the
        earth - how can they come today?  || 69 ||   Fareed: O
        faithless dog, this is not a good way of life. You never come
        to the mosque for your five daily prayers.  || 70 ||   Rise up,
        Fareed, and cleanse yourself; chant your morning prayer. The head
        which does not bow to the Lord - chop off and remove that
        head.  || 71 ||   That head which does not bow to the Lord -
        what is to be done with that head? Put it in the fireplace, instead
        of firewood.  || 72 ||   Fareed, where are your mother and father,
        who gave birth to you? They have left you, but even so, you are
        not convinced that you shall also have to go.  || 73 ||   Fareed,
        flatten out your mind; smooth out the hills and valleys. Hereafter,
        the fires of hell shall not even approach you.  || 74 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  Fareed, the Creator is in the Creation, and the Creation
        abides in God. Whom can we call bad? There is none without Him.
        || 75 ||   Fareed, if on that day when my umbilical cord was
        cut, my throat had been cut instead, I would not have fallen into
        so many troubles, or undergone so many hardships.  || 76 ||  
        My teeth, feet, eyes and ears have stopped working. My body cries
        out, &quot;Those whom I knew have left me!&quot;  || 77 || <br>

      <p> Fareed, answer evil with goodness; do not fill your mind with
        anger. Your body shall not suffer from any disease, and you shall
        obtain everything.  || 78 ||   Fareed, the bird is a guest in
        this beautiful world-garden. The morning drums are beating -
        get ready to leave!  || 79 ||   Fareed, musk is released at night.
        Those who are sleeping do not receive their share. Those whose
        eyes are heavy with sleep - how can they receive it?  ||
        80 ||   Fareed, I thought that I was in trouble; the whole world
        is in trouble! When I climbed the hill and looked around, I saw
        this fire in each and every home.  || 81 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Fareed,
        in the midst of this beautiful earth, there is a garden of thorns.
        Those humble beings who are blessed by their spiritual teacher,
        do not suffer even a scratch.  || 82 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Fareed,
        life is blessed and beautiful, along with the beautiful body.
        Only a rare few are found, who love their Beloved Lord.  || 83
        ||   O river, do not destroy your banks; you too will be asked
        to give your account. The river flows in whatever direction the
        Lord orders.  || 84 ||   Fareed, the day passes painfully; the
        night is spent in anguish. The boatman stands up and shouts, &quot;The
        boat is caught in the whirlpool!&quot;  || 85 ||   The river
        flows on and on; it loves to eat into its banks. What can the
        whirlpool do to the boat, if the boatman remains alert?  || 86
        ||   Fareed, there are dozens who say they are friends; I search,
        but I cannot find even one. I yearn for my beloved like a smouldering
        fire.  || 87 ||   Fareed, this body is always barking. Who can
        stand this constant suffering? I have put plugs in my ears; I
        don't care how much the wind is blowing.  || 88 ||   Fareed,
        God's dates have ripened, and rivers of honey flow. With
        each passing day, your life is being stolen away.  || 89 ||  
        Fareed, my withered body has become a skeleton; the crows are
        pecking at my palms. Even now, God has not come to help me; behold,
        this is the fate of all mortal beings.  || 90 ||   The crows have
        searched my skeleton, and eaten all my flesh. But please do not
        touch these eyes; I hope to see my Lord.  || 91 ||   O crow, do
        not peck at my skeleton; if you have landed on it, fly away. Do
        not eat the flesh from that skeleton, within which my Husband
        Lord abides.  || 92 ||   Fareed, the poor grave calls out, &quot;O
        homeless one, come back to your home. You shall surely have to
        come to me; do not be afraid of death.&quot;  || 93 ||   These
        eyes have seen a great many leave. Fareed, the people have their
        fate, and I have mine.  || 94 ||   God says, &quot;If you reform
        yourself, you shall meet me, and meeting me, you shall be at peace.
        O Fareed, if you will be mine, the whole world will be yours.&quot;
        || 95 ||   How long can the tree remain implanted on the river-bank?
        Fareed, how long can water be kept in a soft clay pot?  || 96
        ||   Fareed, the mansions are vacant; those who lived in them
        have gone to live underground. <br>

      <p> They remain there, in those unhonored graves. O Shaykh, dedicate
        yourself to God; you will have to depart, today or tomorrow. 
        || 97 ||   Fareed, the shore of death looks like the river-bank,
        being eroded away. Beyond is the burning hell, from which cries
        and shrieks are heard. Some understand this completely, while
        others wander around carelessly. Those actions which are done
        in this world, shall be examined in the Court of the Lord.  ||
        98 ||   Fareed, the crane perches on the river bank, playing joyfully.
        While it is playing, a hawk suddenly pounces on it. When the Hawk
        of God attacks, playful sport is forgotten. God does what is not
        expected or even considered.  || 99 ||   The body is nourished
        by water and grain. The mortal comes into the world with high
        hopes. But when the Messenger of Death comes, it breaks down all
        the doors. It binds and gags the mortal, before the eyes of his
        beloved brothers. Behold, the mortal being is going away, carried
        on the shoulders of four men. Fareed, only those good deeds done
        in the world will be of any use in the Court of the Lord.  ||
        100 ||   Fareed, I am a sacrifice to those birds which live in
        the jungle. They peck at the roots and live on the ground, but
        they do not leave the Lord's side.  || 101 ||   Fareed,
        the seasons change, the woods shake and the leaves drop from the
        trees. I have searched in the four directions, but I have not
        found any resting place anywhere.  || 102 ||   Fareed, I have
        torn my clothes to tatters; now I wear only a rough blanket. I
        wear only those clothes which will lead me to meet my Lord.  ||
        103 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Who do you tear apart your fine clothes,
        and take to wearing a rough blanket? O Nanak, even sitting in
        your own home, you can meet the Lord, if your mind is in the right
        place.  || 104 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Fareed, those who are very proud
        of their greatness, wealth and youth, shall return empty-handed
        from their Lord, like sandhills after the rain.  || 105 ||   Fareed,
        the faces of those who forget the Lord's Name are dreadful.
        They suffer terrible pain here, and hereafter they find no place
        of rest or refuge.  || 106 ||   Fareed, if you do not awaken in
        the early hours before dawn, you are dead while yet alive. Although
        you have forgotten God, God has not forgotten you.  || 107 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  Fareed, my Husband Lord is full of joy; He is Great
        and Self-sufficient. To be imbued with the Lord God - this
        is the most beautiful decoration.  || 108 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Fareed,
        look upon pleasure and pain as the same; eradicate corruption
        from your heart. Whatever pleases the Lord God is good; understand
        this, and you will reach His Court.  || 109 ||   FIFTH MEHL: 
        Fareed, the world dances as it dances, and you dance with it as
        well. That soul alone does not dance with it, who is under the
        care of the Lord God.  || 110 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Fareed, the heart
        is imbued with this world, but the world is of no use to it at
        all. <br>

      <p> It is so difficult to be like the fakeers - the Holy Saints;
        it is only achieved by perfect karma.  || 111 ||   The first watch
        of the night brings flowers, and the later watches of the night
        bring fruit. Those who remain awake and aware, receive the gifts
        from the Lord.  || 112 ||   The gifts are from our Lord and Master;
        who can force Him to bestow them? Some are awake, and do not receive
        them, while He awakens others from sleep to bless them.  || 113
        ||   You search for your Husband Lord; you must have some fault
        in your body. Those who are known as happy soul-brides, do not
        look to others.  || 114 ||   Within yourself, make patience the
        bow, make patience the bowstring, and make patience the arrow.
        The Creator will not let you miss the target.  || 115 ||   Those
        who are patient abide in patience; in this way, they burn their
        bodies. They are close to the Lord, but they do not reveal their
        secret to anyone.  || 116 ||   Let patience be your purpose in
        life; implant this within your being. In this way, you will grow
        into a great river; you will not break off into a tiny stream.
        || 117 ||   Fareed, it is difficult to be a dervish -
        a Holy Saint; it is easier to love bread when it is buttered.
        Only a rare few follow the way of the Saints.  || 118 ||   My
        body is cooking like an oven; my bones are burning like firewood.
        If my feet become tired, I will walk on my head, if I can meet
        my Beloved.  || 119 ||   Do not heat up your body like an oven,
        and do not burn your bones like firewood. What harm have your
        feet and head done to you? Behold your Beloved within yourself.
        || 120 ||   I search for my Friend, but my Friend is already
        with me. O Nanak, the Unseen Lord cannot be seen; He is revealed
        only to the Gurmukh.  || 121 ||   Seeing the swans swimming, the
        cranes became excited. The poor cranes were drowned to death,
        with their heads below the water and their feet sticking out above.
        || 122 ||   I knew him as a great swan, so I associated with
        him. If I had known that he was a only wretched crane, I would
        never in my life have crossed paths with him.  || 123 ||   Who
        is a swan, and who is a crane, if God blesses him with His Glance
        of Grace?  || 124 ||   There is only one bird in the lake, but
        there are fifty trappers. This body is caught in the waves of
        desire. O my True Lord, You are my only hope!  || 125 ||   What
        is that word, what is that virtue, and what is that magic mantra?
        What are those clothes, which I can wear to captivate my Husband
        Lord?  || 126 ||   Humility is the word, forgiveness is the virtue,
        and sweet speech is the magic mantra. Wear these three robes,
        O sister, and you will captivate your Husband Lord.  || 127 ||
        If you are wise, be simple; if you are powerful, be weak; and
        when there is nothing to share, then share with others. How rare
        is one who known as such a devotee.  || 128 ||   Do not utter
        even a single harsh word; your True Lord and Master abides in
        all. Do not break anyone's heart; these are all priceless
        jewels.  || 129 ||   The minds of all are like precious jewels;
