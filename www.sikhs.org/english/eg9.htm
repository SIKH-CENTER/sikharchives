        RAAG MAAJH,  CHAU-PADAS,  FIRST HOUSE,  FOURTH MEHL:
        <p> <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD. </b> </p>
        <p> <b>THE NAME IS TRUTH. </b> </p>
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  NO FEAR.  NO HATRED. </p>
        <p> IMAGE OF THE UNDYING,  BEYOND BIRTH,  SELF-EXISTENT. </p>
        <p> BY GURU'S GRACE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind. By great
        good fortune, I meditate on the Lord's Name. The Perfect
        Guru has attained spiritual perfection in the Name of the Lord.
        How rare are those who follow the Guru's Teachings.  || 1
        ||   I have loaded my pack with the provisions of the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har. The Companion of my breath of life shall always
        be with me. The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord's Name
        within me. I have the Imperishable Treasure of the Lord in my
        lap.  || 2 ||   The Lord, Har, Har, is my Best Friend; He is my
        Beloved Lord King. If only someone would come and introduce me
        to Him, the Rejuvenator of my breath of life. I cannot survive
        without seeing my Beloved. My eyes are welling up with tears.
        || 3 ||   My Friend, the True Guru, has been my Best Friend since
        I was very young. I cannot survive without seeing Him, O my mother!
        O Dear Lord, please show Mercy to me, that I may meet the Guru.
        Servant Nanak gathers the Wealth of the Lord's Name in his
        lap.  || 4 || 1 ||   MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Lord is my mind,
        body and breath of life. I do not know any other than the Lord.
        If only I could have the good fortune to meet some friendly Saint;
        he might show me the Way to my Beloved Lord God.  || 1 ||   I
        have searched my mind and body, through and through. How can I
        meet my Darling Beloved, O my mother? Joining the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, I ask about the Path to God. In that Congregation,
        the Lord God abides.  || 2 ||   My Darling Beloved True Guru is
        my Protector. I am a helpless child - please cherish me. The
        Guru, the Perfect True Guru, is my Mother and Father. Obtaining
        the Water of the Guru, the lotus of my heart blossoms forth. 
        || 3 ||   Without seeing my Guru, sleep does not come. My mind
        and body are afflicted with the pain of separation from the Guru.
        O Lord, Har, Har, show mercy to me, that I may meet my Guru. Meeting
        the Guru, servant Nanak blossoms forth.  || 4 || 2 || </p>

      <p> MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  Read of the Lord's Glories and reflect
        upon the Lord's Glories. Listen continually to the Sermon
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Joining the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, and singing the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord, you shall cross over the treacherous and terrifying world-ocean.
        || 1 ||   Come, friends, let us meet our Lord. Bring me a message
        from my Beloved. He alone is a friend, companion, beloved and
        brother of mine, who shows me the way to the Lord, the Lord of
        all.  || 2 ||   My illness is known only to the Lord and the Perfect
        Guru. I cannot continue living without chanting the Naam. So give
        me the medicine, the Mantra of the Perfect Guru. Through the Name
        of the Lord, Har, Har, I am saved.  || 3 ||   I am just a poor
        song-bird, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru, who has placed the
        Drop of Water, the Lord's Name, Har, Har, in my mouth. The
        Lord is the Treasure of Water; I am just a fish in that water.
        Without this Water, servant Nanak would die.  || 4 || 3 ||   MAAJH,
        FOURTH MEHL:  O servants of the Lord, O Saints, O my Siblings
        of Destiny, let us join together! Show me the way to my Lord God - I
        am so hungry for Him! Please reward my faith, O Life of the World,
        O Great Giver. Obtaining the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan, my mind is fulfilled.  || 1 ||   Joining the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, I chant the Bani of the Lord's Word.
        The Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind. The
        Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, is so sweet
        to my mind. Meeting the True Guru, I drink in this Ambrosial Nectar.
        || 2 ||   By great good fortune, the Lord's Congregation
        is found, while the unfortunate ones wander around in doubt, enduring
        painful beatings. Without good fortune, the Sat Sangat is not
        found; without this Sangat, people are stained with filth  and
        pollution.  || 3 ||   Come and meet me, O Life of the World, my
        Beloved. Please bless me with Your Mercy, and enshrine Your Name,
        Har, Har, within my mind. Through the Guru's Teachings, the
        Sweet Name has become pleasing to my mind. Servant Nanak's
        mind is drenched and delighted with the Naam.  || 4 || 4 ||  
        MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  Through the Guru, I have obtained the Lord's
        spiritual wisdom. I have obtained the Sublime Essence of the Lord.
        My mind is imbued with the Love of the Lord; I drink in the Sublime
        Essence of the Lord. With my mouth, I chant the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har; my mind is filled to overflowing with the Sublime Essence
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Come, O Saints, and lead me to my Lord's
        Embrace. Recite to me the Sermon of my Beloved. I dedicate my
        mind to those Saints of the Lord, who chant the Word of the Guru's
        Bani with their mouths.  || 2 ||   By great good fortune, the
        Lord has led me to meet His Saint. The Perfect Guru has placed
        the Sublime Essence of the Lord into my mouth. The unfortunate
        ones do not find the True Guru; the self-willed manmukhs continually
        endure reincarnation through the womb.  || 3 ||   God, the Merciful,
        has Himself bestowed His Mercy. He has totally removed the poisonous
        pollution of egotism. O Nanak, in the shops of the city of the
        human body, the Gurmukhs buy the merchandise of the Lord's
        Name.  || 4 || 5 ||   MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  I meditate on the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and the Name of
        the Lord. Joining the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, the Name
        comes to dwell in the mind. The Lord God is our Lord and Master,
        Inaccessible and Unfathomable. </p>

      <p> Meeting the True Guru, I enjoy the Sublime Essence of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   Blessed, blessed are the humble servants of the Lord,
        who know the Lord God. I go and ask those humble servants about
        the Mysteries of the Lord. I wash and massage their feet; joining
        with the humble servants of the Lord, I drink in the Sublime Essence
        of the Lord.  || 2 ||   The True Guru, the Giver, has implanted
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me. By great good fortune,
        I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.
        The True Essence is Ambrosial Nectar; through the Ambrosial Words
        of the Perfect Guru, this Amrit is obtained.  || 3 ||   O Lord,
        lead me to the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and the true
        beings. Joining the Sat Sangat, I meditate on the Lord's
        Name. O Nanak, I listen and chant the Lord's Sermon; through
        the Guru's Teachings, I am fulfilled by the Name of the Lord.
        || 4 || 6 ||   MAAJH,  FOURTH MEHL:  Come, dear sisters - let
        us join together. I am a sacrifice to the one who tells me of
        my Beloved. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have
        found the Lord, my Best Friend. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru.
        || 1 ||   Wherever I look, there I see my Lord and Master. You
        are permeating each and every heart, O Lord, Inner-knower, Searcher
        of Hearts. The Perfect Guru has shown me that the Lord is always
        with me. I am forever a sacrifice to the True Guru.  || 2 || 
        There is only one breath; all are made of the same clay; the
        light within all is the same. The One Light pervades all the many
        and various beings. This Light intermingles with them, but it
        is not diluted or obscured. By Guru's Grace, I have come
        to see the One. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru.  || 3 ||  
        Servant Nanak speaks the Ambrosial Bani of the Word. It is dear
        and pleasing to the minds of the GurSikhs. The Guru, the Perfect
        True Guru, shares the Teachings. The Guru, the True Guru, is Generous
        to all.  || 4 || 7 ||   SEVEN CHAU-PADAS OF THE FOURTH MEHL.

      <p> My mind longs for the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.
        It cries out like the thirsty song-bird. My thirst is not quenched,
        and I can find no peace, without the Blessed Vision of the Beloved
        Saint.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to
        the Blessed Vision of the Beloved Saint Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Your Face is so Beautiful, and the Sound of Your Words imparts
        intuitive wisdom. It is so long since this sparrow-hawk has had
        even a glimpse of water. Blessed is that land where You dwell,
        O my Friend and Intimate Divine Guru.  || 2 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        I am forever a sacrifice, to my Friend and Intimate Divine Guru.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When I could not be with You for just one
        moment, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga dawned for me. </p>

      <p> When will I meet You, O my Beloved Lord? I cannot endure the night,
        and sleep does not come, without the Sight of the Beloved Guru's
        Court.  || 3 ||   I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to
        that True Court of the Beloved Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By
        good fortune, I have met the Saint Guru. I have found the Immortal
        Lord within the home of my own self. I will now serve You forever,
        and I shall never be separated from You, even for an instant.
        Servant Nanak is Your slave, O Beloved Master.  || 4 ||   I am
        a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice; servant Nanak is Your slave,
        Lord.  ||  Pause  || 1 || 8 ||   RAAG MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  Sweet
        is that season when I remember You. Sublime is that work which
        is done for You. Blessed is that heart in which You dwell, O Giver
        of all.  || 1 ||   You are the Universal Father of all, O my Lord
        and Master. Your nine treasures are an inexhaustible storehouse.
        Those unto whom You give are satisfied and fulfilled; they become
        Your devotees, Lord.  || 2 ||   All place their hopes in You.
        You dwell deep within each and every heart. All share in Your
        Grace; none are beyond You.  || 3 ||   You Yourself liberate the
        Gurmukhs; You Yourself consign the self-willed manmukhs to wander
        in reincarnation. Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to You; Your Entire
        Play is self-evident, Lord.  || 4 || 2 || 9 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The Unstruck Melody resounds and resonates in peaceful
        ease. I rejoice in the eternal bliss of the Word of the Shabad.
        In the cave of intuitive wisdom I sit, absorbed in the silent
        trance of the Primal Void. I have obtained my seat in the heavens.
        || 1 ||   After wandering through many other homes and houses,
        I have returned to my own home, and I have found what I was longing
        for. I am satisfied and fulfilled; O Saints, the Guru has shown
        me the Fearless Lord God.  || 2 ||   He Himself is the King, and
        He Himself is the people. He Himself is in Nirvaanaa, and He Himself
        indulges in pleasures. He Himself sits on the throne of true justice,
        answering the cries and prayers of all.  || 3 ||   As I have seen
        Him, so have I described Him. This Sublime Essence comes only
        to one who knows the Mystery of the Lord. His light merges into
        the Light, and he finds peace. O servant Nanak, this is all the
        Extension of the One.  || 4 || 3 || 10 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:
        That house, in which the soul-bride has married her Husband Lord - in
        that house, O my companions, sing the songs of rejoicing. Joy
        and celebrations decorate that house, in which the Husband Lord
        has adorned His soul-bride.  || 1 ||   She is virtuous, and she
        is very fortunate; she is noble and tender-hearted. The happy
        soul-bride is loved by her Husband. She is beautiful, wise, and
        clever. That soul-bride is the beloved of her Husband Lord.  ||
        2 ||   She is well-mannered, noble and distinguished. She is decorated
        and adorned with wisdom. She is from a most respected family;
        she is the queen, adorned with the Love of her Husband Lord. 
        || 3 ||   Her glory cannot be described; she melts in the Embrace
        of her Husband Lord. </p>

        O Servant Nanak, His Love is her only Support.  || 4 || 4 || 11
        ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have searched and searched, seeking
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. I travelled through all sorts
        of woods and forests. My Lord, Har, Har, is both absolute and
        related, unmanifest and manifest; is there anyone who can come
        and unite me with Him?  || 1 ||   People recite from memory the
        wisdom of the six schools of philosophy; they perform worship
        services, wear ceremonial religious marks on their foreheads,
        and take ritual cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
        They perform the inner cleansing practice with water and adopt
        the eighty-four Yogic postures; but still, they find no peace
        in any of these.  || 2 ||   They chant and meditate, practicing
        austere self-discipline for years and years; they wander on journeys
        all over the earth; and yet, their hearts are not at peace, even
        for an instant. The Yogi rises up and goes out, over and over
        again.  || 3 ||   By His Mercy, I have met the Holy Saint. My
        mind and body have been cooled and soothed; I have been blessed
        with patience and composure. The Immortal Lord God has come to
        dwell within my heart. Nanak sings the songs of joy to the Lord.
        || 4 || 5 || 12 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Supreme Lord God
        is Infinite and Divine; He is Inaccessible, Incomprehensible,
        Invisible and Inscrutable. Merciful to the meek, Sustainer of
        the World, Lord of the Universe - meditating on the Lord, the
        Gurmukhs find salvation.  || 1 ||   The Gurmukhs are emancipated
        by the Lord. The Lord Krishna becomes the Gurmukh's Companion.
        The Gurmukh finds the Merciful Lord. He is not found any other
        way.  || 2 ||   He does not need to eat; His Hair is Wondrous
        and Beautiful; He is free of hate. Millions of people worship
        His Feet. He alone is a devotee, who becomes Gurmukh, whose heart
        is filled with the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   Forever fruitful
        is the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; He is Infinite and Incomparable.
        He is Awesome and All-powerful; He is forever the Great Giver.
        As Gurmukh, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall
        be carried across. O Nanak, rare are those who know this state!
        || 4 || 6 || 13 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  As You command, I obey;
        as You give, I receive. You are the Pride of the meek and the
        poor. You are everything; You are my Beloved. I am a sacrifice
        to Your Creative Power.  || 1 ||   By Your Will, we wander in
        the wilderness; by Your Will, we find the path. By Your Will,
        we become Gurmukh and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. By
        Your Will, we wander in doubt through countless lifetimes. Everything
        happens by Your Will.  || 2 ||   No one is foolish, and no one
        is clever. Your Will determines everything; You are Inaccessible,
        Incomprehensible, Infinite and Unfathomable. Your Value cannot
        be expressed.  || 3 ||   Please bless me with the dust of the
        Saints, O my Beloved. I have come and fallen at Your Door, O Lord.
        Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, my mind is fulfilled.
        O Nanak, with natural ease, I merge into Him.  || 4 || 7 || 14
        ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  They forget the Lord, and they suffer
        in pain. Afflicted with hunger, they run around in all directions.
        Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, they are happy forever.
        The Lord, Merciful to the meek, bestows it upon them.  || 1 ||
        My True Guru is absolutely All-powerful. </p>

      <p> When I dwell upon Him in my soul, all my sorrows depart. The sickness
        of anxiety and the disease of ego are cured; He Himself cherishes
        me.  || 2 ||   Like a child, I ask for everything. God is Bountiful
        and Beautiful; He never comes up empty. Again and again, I fall
        at His Feet. He is Merciful to the meek, the Sustainer of the
        World.  || 3 ||   I am a sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru, who
        has shattered all my bonds. With the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        in my heart, I have been purified. O Nanak, His Love has imbued
        me with nectar.  || 4 || 8 || 15 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my

        Infinite Lord and Master: continually remembering You in deep

        Treasure, Fearless, free of hate, Unfathomable, Immeasurable,
        of Undying Form, Unborn, Self-illumined: remembering You in meditation,
        my mind is filled with a deep and profound peace.  || 2 ||   The
        Joyous Lord, the Sustainer of the World, is my constant Companion.
        He cherishes the high and the low. The Nectar of the Name satisfies
        my mind. As Gurmukh, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.  || 3 ||
        In suffering and in comfort, I meditate on You, O Beloved. I
        have obtained this sublime understanding from the Guru. You are
        Nanak's Support, O my Lord and Master; through Your Love,
        I swim across to the other side.  || 4 || 9 || 16 ||   MAAJH,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Blessed is that time when I meet the True Guru.
        Gazing upon the Fruitful Vision of His Darshan, I have been saved.
        Blessed are the hours, the minutes and the seconds - blessed
        is that Union with Him.  || 1 ||   Making the effort, my mind
        has become pure. Walking on the Lord's Path, my doubts have
        all been cast out. The True Guru has inspired me to hear the Treasure
        of the Naam; all my illness has been dispelled.  || 2 ||   The
        Word of Your Bani is inside and outside as well. You Yourself
        chant it, and You Yourself speak it. The Guru has said that He
        is One - All is the One. There shall never be any other.  ||
        3 ||   I drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Essence from the Guru;
        the Lord's Name has become my clothing and food. The Name
        is my delight, the Name is my play and entertainment. O Nanak,
        I have made the Name my enjoyment.  || 4 || 10 || 17 ||   MAAJH,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I beg of all the Saints: please, give me the merchandise.
        I offer my prayers - I have forsaken my pride. I am a sacrifice,
        hundreds of thousands of times a sacrifice, and I pray: please,
        give me the dust of the feet of the Saints.  || 1 ||   You are
        the Giver, You are the Architect of Destiny. You are All-powerful,
        the Giver of Eternal Peace. You bless everyone. Please bring my
        life to fulfillment.  || 2 ||   The body-temple is sanctified
        by the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, and thus, the impregnable
        fort of the soul is conquered. You are the Giver, You are the
        Architect of Destiny. There is no other warrior as great as You.

      <p> I applied the dust of the feet of the Saints to my face. My evil-mindedness
        disappeared, along with my misfortune and false-mindedness. I
        sit in the true home of my self; I sing His Glorious Praises.
        O Nanak, my falsehood has vanished!  || 4 || 11 || 18 ||   MAAJH,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I shall never forget You - You are such a Great
        Giver! Please grant Your Grace, and imbue me with the love of
        devotional worship. If it pleases You, let me meditate on You
        day and night; please, grant me this gift!  || 1 ||   Into this
        blind clay, You have infused awareness. Everything, everywhere
        which You have given is good. Bliss, joyful celebrations, wondrous
        plays and entertainment - whatever pleases You, comes to pass.
        || 2 ||   Everything we receive is a gift from Him - the thirty-six
        delicious foods to eat, cozy beds, cooling breezes, peaceful joy
        and the experience of pleasure.  || 3 ||   Give me that state
        of mind, by which I may not forget You. Give me that understanding,
        by which I may meditate on You. I sing Your Glorious Praises with
        each and every breath. Nanak takes the Support of the Guru's
        Feet.  || 4 || 12 || 19 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  To praise You
        is to follow Your Command and Your Will. That which pleases You
        is spiritual wisdom and meditation. That which pleases God is
        chanting and meditation; to be in harmony with His Will is perfect
        spiritual wisdom.  || 1 ||   He alone sings Your Ambrosial Naam,
        who is pleasing to Your Mind, O my Lord and Master. You belong
        to the Saints, and the Saints belong to You. The minds of the
        Saints are attuned to You, O my Lord and Master.  || 2 ||   You
        cherish and nurture the Saints. The Saints play with You, O Sustainer
        of the World. Your Saints are very dear to You. You are the breath
        of life of the Saints.  || 3 ||   My mind is a sacrifice to those
        Saints who know You, and are pleasing to Your Mind. In their company
        I have found a lasting peace. Nanak is satisfied and fulfilled
        with the Sublime Essence of the Lord.  || 4 || 13 || 20 ||   MAAJH,
        FIFTH MEHL:  You are the Ocean of Water, and I am Your fish.
        Your Name is the drop of water, and I am a thirsty sparrow-hawk.
        You are my hope, and You are my thirst. My mind is absorbed in
        You.  || 1 ||   Just as the baby is satisfied by drinking milk,
        and the poor person is pleased by seeing wealth, and the thirsty
        person is refreshed by drinking cool water, so is this mind drenched
        with delight in the Lord.  || 2 ||   Just as the darkness is lit
        up by the lamp, and the hopes of the wife are fulfilled by thinking
        about her husband, and people are filled with bliss upon meeting
        their beloved, so is my mind imbued with the Lord's Love.
        || 3 ||   The Saints have set me upon the Lord's Path. By
        the Grace of the Holy Saint, I have been attuned to the Lord.
        The Lord is mine, and I am the slave of the Lord. O Nanak, the
        Guru has blessed me with the True Word of the Shabad.  || 4 ||
        14 || 21 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Ambrosial Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, is eternally pure. The Lord is the Giver of Peace
        and the Dispeller of sorrow. </p>

      <p> I have seen and tasted all other flavors, but to my mind, the
        Subtle Essence of the Lord is the sweetest of all.  || 1 ||  
        Whoever drinks this in, is satisfied. Whoever obtains the Sublime
        Essence of the Naam becomes immortal. The Treasure of the Naam
        is obtained by one whose mind is filled with the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 2 ||   One who obtains the Sublime Essence of the
        Lord is satisfied and fulfilled. One who obtains this Flavor of
        the Lord does not waver. One who has this destiny written on his
        forehead obtains the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   The
        Lord has come into the hands of the One, the Guru, who has blessed
        so many with good fortune. Attached to Him, a great many have
        been liberated. The Gurmukh obtains the Treasure of the Naam;
        says Nanak, those who see the Lord are very rare.  || 4 || 15
        || 22 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  My Lord, Har, Har, Har, is the
        nine treasures, the supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas,
        wealth and prosperity. He is the Deep and Profound Treasure of
        Life. Hundreds of thousands, even millions of pleasures and delights
        are enjoyed by one who falls at the Guru's Feet.  || 1 ||
        Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all are sanctified,
        and all family and friends are saved. By Guru's Grace, I
        meditate on the Inaccessible and Unfathomable True Lord.  || 2
        ||   The One, the Guru, who is sought by all - only a few,
        by great good fortune, receive His Darshan. His Place is lofty,
        infinite and unfathomable; the Guru has shown me that palace.
        || 3 ||   Your Ambrosial Name is deep and profound. That person
        is liberated, in whose heart You dwell. The Guru cuts away all
        his bonds; O Servant Nanak, he is absorbed in the poise of intuitive
        peace.  || 4 || 16 || 23 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  By God's
        Grace, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. By God's Kindness,
        I sing the songs of joy. While standing and sitting, while sleeping
        and while awake, meditate on the Lord, all your life.  || 1 ||
        The Holy Saint has given me the Medicine of the Naam. The residues
        of my mistakes have been cut out, and I have become pure. I am
        filled with bliss, and all my pains have been taken away. All
        my suffering has been dispelled.  || 2 ||   One who has my Beloved
        on his side, is liberated from the world-ocean. One who recognizes
        the Guru practices Truth; why should he be afraid?  || 3 ||  
        Since I found the Company of the Holy and met the Guru, the demon
        of pride has departed. With each and every breath, Nanak sings
        the Lord's Praises. The True Guru has covered my sins.  ||
        4 || 17 || 24 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  Through and through, the
        Lord is intermingled with His servant. God, the Giver of Peace,
        cherishes His servant. I carry the water, wave the fan, and grind
        the grain for the servant of my Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   God
        has cut the noose from around my neck; He has placed me in His
        Service. The Lord and Master's Command is pleasing to the
        mind of His servant. He does that which pleases his Lord and Master.
        Inwardly and outwardly, the servant knows his Lord.  || 2 || 
        You are the All-knowing Lord and Master; You know all ways and
        means. </p>

      <p> The servant of the Lord and Master enjoys the Love and Affection
        of the Lord. That which belongs to the Lord and Master, belongs
        to His servant. The servant becomes distinguished in association
        with his Lord and Master.  || 3 ||   He, whom the Lord and Master
        dresses in the robes of honor, is not called to answer for his
        account any longer. Nanak is a sacrifice to that servant. He is
        the pearl of the deep and unfathomable Ocean of God.  || 4 ||
        18 || 25 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  Everything is within the home
        of the self; there is nothing beyond. One who searches outside
        is deluded by doubt. By Guru's Grace, one who has found the
        Lord within is happy, inwardly and outwardly.  || 1 ||   Slowly,
        gently, drop by drop, the stream of nectar trickles down within.
        The mind drinks it in, hearing and reflecting on the Word of the
        Shabad. It enjoys bliss and ecstasy day and night, and plays with
        the Lord forever and ever.  || 2 ||   I was separated and cut
        off from the Lord for so many lifetimes; by the Grace of the Holy
        Saint, the dried-up branches have blossomed forth again in their
        greenery. I have obtained this sublime understanding, and I meditate
        on the Naam; as Gurmukh, I have met the Lord.  || 3 ||   As the
        waves of water merge again with the water, so does my light merge
        again into the Light. Says Nanak, the veil of illusion has been
        cut away, and I shall not go out wandering any more.  || 4 ||
        19 || 26 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  I am a sacrifice to those who
        have heard of You. I am a sacrifice to those whose tongues speak
        of You. Again and again, I am a sacrifice to those who meditate
        on You with mind and body.  || 1 ||   I wash the feet of those
        who walk upon Your Path. With my eyes, I long to behold those
        kind people. I offer my mind to those friends, who have met the
        Guru and found God.  || 2 ||   Very fortunate are those who know
        You. In the midst of all, they remain detached and balanced in
        Nirvaanaa. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, they
        cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and conquer all their evil
        passions.  || 3 ||   My mind has entered their Sanctuary. I have
        renounced my pride in my own strength, and the darkness of emotional
        attachment. Please bless Nanak with the Gift of the Naam, the
        Name of the Inaccessible and Unfathomable God.  || 4 || 20 ||
        27 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are the tree; Your branches have
        blossomed forth. From the very small and subtle, You have become
        huge and manifest. You are the Ocean of Water, and You are the
        foam and the bubbles on its surface. I cannot see any other except
        You, Lord.  || 1 ||   You are the thread, and You are also the
        beads. You are the knot, and You are the primary bead of the maalaa.
        In the beginning, in the middle and in the end, there is God.
        I cannot see any other except You, Lord.  || 2 ||   You transcend
        all qualities, and You possess the supreme qualities. You are
        the Giver of peace. You are detached in Nirvaanaa, and You are
        the Enjoyer, imbued with love. You Yourself know Your Own Ways;
        You dwell upon Yourself.  || 3 ||   You are the Master, and then
        again, You are the servant. O God, You Yourself are the Manifest
        and the Unmanifest. Slave Nanak sings Your Glorious Praises forever. </p>

      <p> Please, just for a moment, bless him with Your Glance of Grace.
        || 4 || 21 || 28 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  Blessed are those
        words, by which the Naam is chanted. Rare are those who know this,
        by Guru's Grace. Blessed is that time when one sings and
        hears the Lord's Name. Blessed and approved is the coming
        of such a one.  || 1 ||   Those eyes which behold the Blessed
        Vision of the Lord's Darshan are approved and accepted. Those
        hands which write the Praises of the Lord are good. Those feet
        which walk in the Lord's Way are beautiful. I am a sacrifice
        to that Congregation in which the Lord is recognized.  || 2 ||
        Listen, O my beloved friends and companions: in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, you shall be saved in an instant. The
        residues of your sinful mistakes will be cut out; your mind will
        be immaculate and pure. Your comings and goings shall cease. 
        || 3 ||   With my palms pressed together, I offer this prayer:
        please bless me with Your Mercy, and save this sinking stone.
        God has become merciful to Nanak; God is pleasing to Nanak's
        mind.  || 4 || 22 || 29 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Word of
        Your Bani, Lord, is Ambrosial Nectar. Hearing it again and again,
        I am elevated to the supreme heights. The burning within me has
        been extinguished, and my mind has been cooled and soothed, by
        the Blessed Vision of the True Guru.  || 1 ||   Happiness is obtained,
        and sorrow runs far away, when the Saints chant the Lord's
        Name. The sea, the dry land, and the lakes are filled with the
        Water of the Lord's Name; no place is left empty.  || 2 ||
        The Creator has showered His Kindness; He cherishes and nurtures
        all beings and creatures. He is Merciful, Kind and Compassionate.
        All are satisfied and fulfilled through Him.  || 3 ||   The woods,
        the meadows and the three worlds are rendered green. The Doer
        of all did this in an instant. As Gurmukh, Nanak meditates on
        the One who fulfills the desires of the mind.  || 4 || 23 || 30
        ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are my Father, and You are my Mother.
        You are my Relative, and You are my Brother. You are my Protector
        everywhere; why should I feel any fear or anxiety?  || 1 ||  
        By Your Grace, I recognize You. You are my Shelter, and You are
        my Honor. Without You, there is no other; the entire Universe
        is the Arena of Your Play.  || 2 ||   You have created all beings
        and creatures. As it pleases You, You assign tasks to one and
        all. All things are Your Doing; we can do nothing ourselves. 
        || 3 ||   Meditating on the Naam, I have found great peace. Singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, my mind is cooled and soothed.
        Through the Perfect Guru, congratulations are pouring in - Nanak
        is victorious on the arduous battlefield of life!  || 4 || 24
        || 31 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  God is the Breath of Life of my
        soul, the Support of my mind. His devotees live by singing the
        Glorious Praises of the Infinite Lord. The Ambrosial Name of the
        Lord is the Treasure of Excellence. Meditating, meditating on
        the Lord's Name, I have found peace.  || 1 || </p>

        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, shall be rid of the cycle
        of birth and death. His hopes and desires are fulfilled, when
        he gains the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.  || 2
        ||   The limits of the Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord cannot
        be known. The seekers, the Siddhas, those beings of miraculous
        spiritual powers, and the spiritual teachers, all meditate on
        Him. Thus, their egos are erased, and their doubts are dispelled.
        The Guru has enlightened their minds.  || 3 ||   I chant the Name
        of the Lord, the Treasure of bliss, joy, salvation, intuitive
        peace and poise. When my Lord and Master blessed me with His Mercy,
        O Nanak, then His Name entered the home of my mind.  || 4 || 24

        Singing Your Glorious Praises, my mind is rejuvenated. Hearing
        Your Sermon, all filth is removed. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, I meditate forever on the Merciful Lord.
        || 2 ||   I dwell on my God with each and every breath. This
        understanding has been implanted within my mind, by Guru's
        Grace. By Your Grace, the Divine Light has dawned. The Merciful
        Lord cherishes everyone.  || 3 ||   True, True, True is that God.
        Forever, forever and ever, He Himself is. Your Playful Ways are
        revealed, O my Beloved. Beholding them, Nanak is enraptured. 
        || 4 || 26 || 33 ||   MAAJH,  FIFTH MEHL:  By His Command, the
        rain begins to fall. The Saints and friends have met to chant
        the Naam. Serene tranquility and peaceful ease have come; God
        Himself has brought a deep and profound peace.  || 1 ||   God
        has produced everything in great abundance. Granting His Grace,
        God has satisfied all. Bless us with Your Gifts, O my Great Giver.
        All beings and creatures are satisfied.  || 2 ||   True is the
        Master, and True is His Name. By Guru's Grace, I meditate
        forever on Him. The fear of birth and death has been dispelled;
        emotional attachment, sorrow and suffering have been erased. 
        || 3 ||   With each and every breath, Nanak praises the Lord.
        Meditating in remembrance on the Name, all bonds are cut away.
        One's hopes are fulfilled in an instant, chanting the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.  || 4 || 27 || 34 ||   MAAJH,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Come, dear friends, Saints and companions: let us
        join together and sing the Glorious Praises of the Inaccessible
        and Infinite Lord. Those who sing and hear these praises are liberated,
        so let us meditate on the One who created us.  || 1 ||   The sinful
        residues of countless incarnations depart, and we receive the
        fruits of the mind's desires. So meditate on that Lord, our
        True Lord and Master, who gives sustenance to all.  || 2 ||  
        Chanting the Naam, all pleasures are obtained. All fears are erased,
        meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. One who serves the
        Lord swims across to the other side, and all his affairs are resolved.
        || 3 ||   I have come to Your Sanctuary; if it pleases You, unite
        me with You. <br>
