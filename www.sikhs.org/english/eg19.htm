      <p> They are tormenting and torturing me. I have come, seeking Your
        Sanctuary.  || 1 ||   Trying all sorts of things, I have grown
        weary, but still, they will not leave me alone. But I have heard
        that they can be rooted out, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy; and so I seek their Shelter.  || 2 ||   In their
        Mercy, the Saints have met me, and from them, I have obtained
        satisfaction. The Saints have given me the Mantra of the Fearless
        Lord, and now I practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad. 
        || 3 ||   I have now conquered those terrible evil-doers, and
        my speech is now sweet and sublime. Says Nanak, the Divine Light
        has dawned within my mind; I have obtained the state of Nirvaanaa.
        || 4 || 4 || 125 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He is the Eternal
        King. The Fearless Lord abides with you. So where does this fear
        come from?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In one person, You are arrogant
        and proud, and in another, You are meek and humble. In one person,
        You are all by Yourself, and in another, You are poor.  || 1 ||
        In one person, you are a Pandit, a religious scholar and a preacher,
        and in another, You are just a fool. In one person, You grab hold
        of everything, and in another, You accept nothing.  || 2 ||  
        What can the poor wooden puppet do? The Master Puppeteer knows
        everything. As the Puppeteer dresses the puppet, so is the role
        the puppet plays.  || 3 ||   The Lord has created the various
        chambers of assorted descriptions, and He Himself protects them.
        As is that vessel in which the Lord places the soul, so does it
        dwell. What can this poor being do?  || 4 ||   The One who created
        the thing, understands it; He has fashioned all of this. Says
        Nanak, the Lord and Master is Infinite; He alone understands the
        value of His Creation.  || 5 || 5 || 126 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Give them up  -  give up the pleasures of corruption; you
        are entangled in them, you crazy fool, like an animal grazing
        in the green fields.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That which you believe
        to be of use to you, shall not go even an inch with you. Naked
        you came, and naked you shall depart. You shall go round and round
        the cycle of birth and death, and you shall be food for Death.
        || 1 ||   Watching, watching the transitory dramas of the world,
        you are embroiled and enmeshed in them, and you laugh with delight.
        The string of life is wearing thin, day and night, and you have
        done nothing for your soul.  || 2 ||   Doing your deeds, you have
        grown old; your voice fails you, and your body has become weak.
        You were enticed by Maya in your youth, and your attachment for
        it has not diminished, one little bit.  || 3 ||   The Guru has
        shown me that this is the way of the world; I have abandoned the
        dwelling of pride, and entered Your Sanctuary. The Saint has shown
        me the Path of God; slave Nanak has implanted devotional worship
        and the Praise of the Lord.  || 4 || 6 || 127 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Except for You, who is mine? O my Beloved, You are the
        Support of the breath of life.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You alone
        know the condition of my inner being. You are my Beautiful Friend. </p>

      <p> I receive all comforts from You, O my Unfathomable and Immeasurable
        Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   I cannot describe Your Manifestations,
        O Treasure of Excellence, O Giver of peace. God is Inaccessible,
        Incomprehensible and Imperishable; He is known through the Perfect
        Guru.  || 2 ||   My doubt and fear have been taken away, and I
        have been made pure, since my ego was conquered. My fear of birth
        and death has been abolished, beholding Your Blessed Vision in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 3 ||   I wash the
        Guru's Feet and serve Him; I am a sacrifice to Him, 100,000
        times. By His Grace, servant Nanak has crossed over this terrifying
        world-ocean; I am united with my Beloved.  || 4 || 7 || 128 ||
        GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Who can please You, except You Yourself?
        Gazing upon Your Beauteous Form, all are entranced.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   In the heavenly paradise, in the nether regions of
        the underworld, on the planet earth and throughout the galaxies,
        the One Lord is pervading everywhere. Everyone calls upon You
        with their palms pressed together, saying, &quot;Shiva, Shiva&quot;.
        O Merciful Lord and Master, everyone cries out for Your Help.
        || 1 ||   Your Name, O Lord and Master, is the Purifier of sinners,
        the Giver of peace, immaculate, cooling and soothing. O Nanak,
        spiritual wisdom, meditation and glorious greatness come from
        dialogue and discourse with Your Saints.  || 2 || 8 || 129 ||
        GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meet with me, O my Dear Beloved. O God,
        whatever You do  -  that alone happens.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Wandering around through countless incarnations, I endured pain
        and suffering in so many lives, over and over again. By Your Grace,
        I obtained this human body; grant me the Blessed Vision of Your
        Darshan, O Sovereign Lord King.  || 1 ||   That which pleases
        His Will has come to pass; no one else can do anything. By Your
        Will, enticed by the illusion of emotional attachment, the people
        are asleep; they do not wake up.  || 2 ||   Please hear my prayer,
        O Lord of Life, O Beloved, Ocean of mercy and compassion. Save
        me, O my Father God. I am an orphan  -  please, cherish me!
        || 3 ||   You reveal the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, for
        the sake of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Grant Your
        Grace, and bless us with the dust of the feet of the Saints; Nanak
        yearns for this peace.  || 4 || 9 || 130 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        I am a sacrifice to those who take the Support of the Naam. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   How can I recount the praises of those humble
        beings who are attuned to the Love of the Supreme Lord God? Peace,
        intuitive poise and bliss are with them. There are no other givers
        equal to them.  || 1 ||   They have come to save the world  - 
        those humble beings who thirst for His Blessed Vision. Those who
        seek their Sanctuary are carried across; in the Society of the
        Saints, their hopes are fulfilled.  || 2 ||   If I fall at their
        Feet, then I live; associating with those humble beings, I remain
        happy. O God, please be merciful to me, that my mind might become
        the dust of the feet of Your devotees.  || 3 ||   Power and authority,
        youth and age  -  whatever is seen in this world, all of it
        shall fade away. The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is forever new and immaculate. Nanak has earned this wealth of
        the Lord.  || 4 || 10 || 131 || </p>

      <p> GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I came to the Guru, to learn the Way of
        Yoga. The True Guru has revealed it to me through the Word of
        the Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is contained in the nine
        continents of the world, and within this body; each and every
        moment, I humbly bow to Him. I have made the Guru's Teachings
        my ear-rings, and I have enshrined the One Formless Lord within
        my being.  || 1 ||   I have brought the five disciples together,
        and they are now under the control of the one mind. When the ten
        hermits become obedient to the Lord, then I became an immaculate
        Yogi.  || 2 ||   I have burnt my doubt, and smeared my body with
        the ashes. My path is to see the One and Only Lord. I have made
        that intuitive peace my food; the Lord Master has written this
        pre-ordained destiny upon my forehead.  || 3 ||   In that place
        where there is no fear, I have assumed my Yogic posture. The unstruck
        melody of His Bani is my horn. I have made contemplation upon
        the essential reality my Yogic staff. The Love of the Name in
        my mind is my Yogic lifestyle.  || 4 ||   By great good fortune,
        such a Yogi is met, who cuts away the bonds of Maya. Nanak serves
        and adores this wondrous person, and kisses his feet.  || 5 ||
        11 || 132 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is an incomparably beautiful treasure. Listen, everyone,
        and meditate on it, O friends. Those, unto whom the Guru has given
        the Lord's medicine  -  their minds become pure and immaculate.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Darkness is dispelled from within that body,
        in which the Divine Light of the Guru's Shabad shines. The
        noose of doubt is cut away from those who place their faith in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||   The treacherous
        and terrifying world-ocean is crossed over, in the boat of the
        Saadh Sangat. My mind's desires are fulfilled, meeting the
        Guru, in love with the Lord.  || 2 ||   The devotees have found
        the treasure of the Naam; their minds and bodies are satisfied
        and satiated. O Nanak, the Dear Lord gives it only to those who
        surrender to the Lord's Command.  || 3 || 12 || 133 ||  
        GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Please be kind and compassionate, O Lord
        of my life; I am helpless, and I seek Your Sanctuary, God. Please,
        give me Your Hand, and lift me up, out of the deep dark pit. I
        have no clever tricks at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are the
        Doer, the Cause of causes  -  You are everything. You are All-powerful;
        there is no other than You. You alone know Your condition and
        extent. They alone become Your servants, upon whose foreheads
        such good destiny is recorded.  || 1 ||   You are imbued with
        Your servant, God; Your devotees are woven into Your Fabric, through
        and through. O Darling Beloved, they yearn for Your Name and the
        Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, like the chakvee bird which longs
        to see the moon.  || 2 ||   Between the Lord and His Saint, there
        is no difference at all. Among hundreds of thousands and millions,
        there is scarcely one humble being. Those whose hearts are illuminated
        by God, sing the Kirtan of His Praises night and day with their
        tongues.  || 3 ||   You are All-powerful and Infinite, the most
        lofty and exalted, the Giver of peace; O God, You are the Support
        of the breath of life. </p>

      <p> Please show mercy to Nanak, O God, that he may remain in the Society
        of the Saints.  || 4 || 13 || 134 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  O
        Saint, You are attuned to the Lord. Please stand my me, Architect
        of Destiny; please take me to my destination, Great Giver.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   You alone know Your mystery; You are the Perfect
        Architect of Destiny. I am a helpless orphan  -  please keep
        me under Your Protection and save me.  || 1 ||   Your Feet are
        the boat to carry us across the world-ocean; You alone know Your
        ways. Those whom You keep protected, by Your Kindness, cross over
        to the other side.  || 2 ||   Here and hereafter, God, You are
        All-powerful; everything is in Your Hands. Please give me that
        treasure, which will go along with me, O servant of the Lord.
        || 3 ||   I am without virtue  -  please bless me with virtue,
        so that my mind might chant the Name of the Lord. By the Grace
        of the Saints, Nanak has met the Lord; his mind and body are soothed
        and satisfied.  || 4 || 14 || 135 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I
        am intuitively absorbed in the Divine Lord. The Divine True Guru
        has become Merciful to me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Cutting away
        the halter, He has made me His slave, and now I work for the Saints.
        I have become a worshipper of the One Name; the Guru has shown
        me this amazing wonder.  || 1 ||   The Divine Light has dawned,
        and everything is illuminated; the Guru has revealed this spiritual
        wisdom to my mind. Drinking deeply of the Ambrosial Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, my mind is satisfied, and my fears have been
        vanquished.  || 2 ||   Accepting the Command of the Lord's
        Will, I have found total peace; the home of suffering has been
        destroyed. When God, our Lord and Master was totally pleased,
        He revealed everything in the form of ecstasy.  || 3 ||   Nothing
        comes, and nothing goes; this play is all set in motion by the
        Lord, the Sovereign King. Says Nanak, our Lord and Master is inaccessible
        and unfathomable. The Lord's devotees take His Name as their
        Support.  || 4 || 15 || 136 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He is the
        Supreme Lord God, the Perfect Transcendent Lord; O my mind, hold
        tight to the Support of the One who established the solar systems
        and galaxies. Chant the Name of that Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Renounce the intellectual cleverness of your mind, O humble
        servants of the Lord; understanding the Hukam of His Command,
        peace is found. Whatever God does, accept that with pleasure;
        in comfort and in suffering, meditate on Him.  || 1 ||   The Creator
        emancipates millions of sinners in an instant, without a moment's
        delay. The Lord, the Destroyer of the pain and sorrow of the poor,
        blesses those with whom He is pleased.  || 2 ||   He is Mother
        and Father, the Cherisher of all; He is the Breath of life of
        all beings, the Ocean of peace. While giving so generously, the
        Creator does not diminish at all. The Source of jewels, He is
        All-pervading.  || 3 ||   The beggar begs for Your Name, O Lord
        and Master; God is contained deep within the nucleus of each and
        every heart. Slave Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; no one returns
        from Him empty-handed.  || 4 || 16 || 137 || </p>

        instant, if the tongue repeats His Name. In the Lord's Sanctuary
        there is soothing coolness, peace and tranquility. He has extinguished
        the burning fire.  || 1 ||   He saves us from the hellish pit
        of the womb, and carries us across the terrifying world-ocean.
        Adoring His Lotus Feet in the mind, the fear of death is banished.
        || 2 ||   He is the Perfect, Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent
        Lord, lofty, unfathomable and infinite. Singing His Glorious Praises,
        and meditating on the Ocean of peace, one's life is not lost
        in the gamble.  || 3 ||   My mind is engrossed in sexual desire,
        anger, greed and attachment, O Giver to the unworthy. Please grant
        Your Grace, and bless me with Your Name; Nanak is forever a sacrifice
        to You.  || 4 || 1 || 138 || </p>

        and win the priceless jewel of this human life, by meditating
        on Him in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, even for
        an instant.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Many have renounced and left
        their children, wealth, spouses, joyful games and pleasures. 
        || 1 ||   Horses, elephants and the pleasures of power  - 
        leaving these behind, the fool must depart naked.  || 2 ||   The
        body, scented with musk and sandalwood  -  that body shall
        come to roll in the dust.  || 3 ||   Infatuated with emotional
        attachment, they think that God is far away. Says Nanak, he is
        Ever-present!  || 4 || 1 || 139 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mind,
        cross over with the Support of the Lord's Name. The Guru
        is the boat to carry you across the world-ocean, through the waves
        of cynicism and doubt.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In this Dark Age
        of Kali Yuga, there is only pitch darkness. The lamp of the Guru's
        spiritual wisdom illuminates and enlightens.  || 1 ||   The poison
        of corruption is spread out far and wide. Only the virtuous are
        saved, chanting and meditating on the Lord.  || 2 ||   Intoxicated
        with Maya, the people are asleep. Meeting the Guru, doubt and
        fear are dispelled.  || 3 ||   Says Nanak, meditate on the One
        Lord; behold Him in each and every heart.  || 4 || 2 || 140 ||

        God, You are my power, authority and youth. You are absolute,
        without attributes, and also related, with the most sublime attributes.
        || 2 ||   Here and hereafter, You are my Savior and Protector.
        By Guru's Grace, some understand You.  || 3 ||   God is All-knowing,

        Worship and adore the Lord, Har, Har, Har. In the Society of

        and fear are vanquished.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Vedas, the

        servant dwells as the highest of all.  || 1 ||   All places are

        are free of fear.  || 2 ||   People wander through 8.4 million

        Holy Saints; he has given up power, wisdom, cleverness and egotism.
        || 4 || 6 || 144 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my mind, sing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name. Serve the Lord continually
        and continuously; with each and every breath, meditate on the
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Society of the Saints, the
        Lord dwells in the mind, and pain, suffering, darkness and doubt
        depart.  || 1 ||   That humble being, who meditates on the Lord,

        || 4 || 7 || 145 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  With your tongue,
        chant the Name of the One Lord. In this world, it shall bring
        you peace, comfort and great joy; hereafter, it shall go with
        your soul, and shall be of use to you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        disease of your ego shall be eradicated. By Guru's Grace,

        thirst quenched.  || 2 ||   Those who have found the Lord, the

        by the Vedas and the Saints  -  with that, you are in love.

        to empty out and fill up  -  you have no love for His Lotus
        Feet. O Nanak, I have been saved, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company

        embellishes.  || 1 ||   I do that work which pleases my Lord and

        play.  || 2 ||   I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord's Prime
        Minister; beholding Him, my mind is comforted and consoled.  ||

        his ego, and turn his mind away from this sweet Maya?  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Humanity is in spiritual ignorance; people see things
        that do not exist. The night is dark and gloomy; how will the
        morning dawn?  || 1 ||   Wandering, wandering all around, I have
        grown weary; trying all sorts of things, I have been searching.
        Says Nanak, He has shown mercy to me; I have found the treasure
        of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 2 || 12 || 150
        ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He is the Wish-fulfilling Jewel, the
        Embodiment of Mercy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Supreme Lord God
        is Merciful to the meek; meditating in remembrance on Him, peace
        is obtained.  || 1 ||   The Wisdom of the Undying Primal Being
        is beyond comprehension. Hearing His Praises, millions of sins
        are erased.  || 2 ||   O God, Treasure of Mercy, please bless
        Nanak with Your kindness, that he may repeat the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 3 || 13 || 151 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        O my mind, in the Sanctuary of God, peace is found. That day,
        when the Giver of life and peace is forgotten  -  that day
        passes uselessly.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You have come as a guest
        for one short night, and yet you hope to live for many ages. Households,
        mansions and wealth  -  whatever is seen, is like the shade
        of a tree.  || 1 ||   My body, wealth, and all my gardens and
        property shall all pass away. You have forgotten your Lord and

        You wear white clothes and take cleansing baths, and anoint yourself
        with sandalwood oil. But you do not remember the Fearless, Formless
        Lord  -  you are like an elephant bathing in the mud.  || 3
        ||   When God becomes merciful, He leads you to meet the True
        Guru; all peace is in the Name of the Lord. The Guru has liberated
        me from bondage; servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord.  || 4 || 14 || 152 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my mind,
        dwell always upon the Guru, Guru, Guru. The Guru has made the
        jewel of this human life prosperous and fruitful. I am a sacrifice
        to the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As
        many breaths and morsels as you take, O my mind  -  so many
        times, sing His Glorious Praises. When the True Guru becomes merciful,
        then this wisdom and understanding is obtained.  || 1 ||   O my
        mind, taking the Naam, you shall be released from the bondage
        of death, and the peace of all peace will be found. Serving your
        Lord and Master, the True Guru, the Great Giver, you shall obtain
        the fruits of your mind's desires.  || 2 ||   The Name of
        the Creator is your beloved friend and child; it alone shall go
        along with you, O my mind. So serve your True Guru, and you shall
        receive the Name from the Guru.  || 3 ||   When God, the Merciful
        Guru, showered His Mercy upon me, all my anxieties were dispelled.
        Nanak has found the peace of the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.

        may accumulate hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions,
        and yet the mind is not restrained. They only yearn for more and
        more.  || 1 ||   They may have all sorts of beautiful women, but
        still, they commit adultery in the homes of others. They do not
        distinguish between good and bad.  || 2 ||   They wander around

        His Mercy, remain dead while yet alive. In the Saadh Sangat, the

        Some are bearers of the staff.  || 1 ||   Some chant in meditation,
        some practice deep, austere meditation; some worship Him in adoration,
        some practice daily rituals. Some live the life of a wanderer.
        || 2 ||   Some live by the shore, some live on the water; some
        study the Vedas. Nanak loves to worship the Lord.  || 3 || 2 ||

        O Siblings of Destiny: the Guru has given me this understanding.

        plundered in this world.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Fasting, daily
        rituals, and austere self-discipline  -  those who keep the
        practice of these, are rewarded with less than a shell. Hereafter,
        the way is different, O Siblings of Destiny. There, these things
        are of no use at all.  || 1 ||   Those who bathe at sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage, and wander over the earth, find no place of rest
        hereafter. There, these are of no use at all. By these things,
        they only please other people.  || 2 ||   Reciting the four Vedas
        from memory, they do not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's

        who practice it, swim across. Serve the Guru, and meditate on
