      <p> Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Creator Lord, the
        Architect of Destiny, I am fulfilled.  || 3 ||   In the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak enjoys the Lord's
        Love. He has returned home, with the Perfect Guru.  || 4 || 12
        || 17 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  All treasures come from the
        Perfect Divine Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Chanting the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, the man lives. The faithless cynic dies in
        shame and misery.  || 1 ||   The Name of the Lord has become my
        Protector. The wretched, faithless cynic makes only useless efforts.
        || 2 ||   Spreading slander, many have been ruined. Their necks,
        heads and feet are tied by death's noose.  || 3 ||   Says
        Nanak, the humble devotees chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        The Messenger of Death does not even approach them.  || 4 || 13

        my God? Each and every moment and instant, I continually meditate
        on the Lord.  || 1 ||   I meditate continually on the Lotus Feet
        of God. What wisdom will lead me to attain my Beloved?  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Please, bless me with such Mercy, O my God, that
        Nanak may never, ever forget You.  || 2 || 1 || 19 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:   Within my heart, I meditate on the Lotus Feet of
        God. Disease is gone, and I have found total peace.  || 1 || 
        The Guru relieved my sufferings, and blessed me with the gift.
        My birth has been rendered fruitful, and my life is approved.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Ambrosial Bani of God's Word
        is the Unspoken Speech. Says Nanak, the spiritually wise live
        by meditating on God.  || 2 || 2 || 20 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Guru, the Perfect True Guru, has blessed me with peace and
        tranquility. Peace and joy have welled up, and the mystical trumpets
        of the unstruck sound current vibrate.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sufferings,
        sins and afflictions have been dispelled. Remembering the Lord
        in meditation, all sinful mistakes have been erased.  || 1 ||
        Joining together, O beautiful soul-brides, celebrate and make
        merry. Guru Nanak has saved my honor.  || 2 || 3 || 21 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Intoxicated with the wine of attachment, love of
        worldly possessions and deceit, and bound in bondage, he is wild
        and hideous. Day by day, his life is winding down; practicing
        sin and corruption, he is trapped by the noose of Death.  || 1
        ||   I seek Your Sanctuary, O God, Merciful to the meek. I have
        crossed over the terrible, treacherous, enormous world-ocean,
        with the dust of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   O God, Giver of peace, All-powerful Lord and
        Master, my soul, body and all wealth are Yours. Please, break
        my bonds of doubt, O Transcendent Lord, forever Merciful God of
        Nanak.  || 2 || 4 || 22 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Transcendent
        Lord has brought bliss to all; He has confirmed His Natural Way.
        He has become Merciful to the humble, holy Saints, and all my
        relatives blossom forth in joy.  || 1 ||   The True Guru Himself
        has resolved my affairs. <br>

      <p> He has blessed Hargobind with long life, and taken care of my
        comfort, happiness and well-being.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The forests,
        meadows and the three worlds have blossomed forth in greenery;
        He gives His Support to all beings. Nanak has obtained the fruits
        of his mind's desires; his desires are totally fulfilled.
        || 2 || 5 || 23 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who is blessed
        by the Lord's Mercy, passes his time in contemplative meditation.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, meditate, and vibrate upon the Lord of the Universe. Singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the noose of death is cut away.
        || 1 ||   He Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is the
        Cherisher. Nanak begs for the dust of the feet of the Holy.  ||
        2 || 6 || 24 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Irrigate your mind with
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Night and day, sing the Kirtan
        of the Lord's Praises.  || 1 ||   Enshrine such love, O
        my mind, that twenty-four hours a day, God will seem near to you.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Says Nanak, one who has such immaculate
        destiny - his mind is attached to the Lord's Feet.
        || 2 || 7 || 25 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The disease is gone;
        God Himself took it away. I sleep in peace; peaceful poise has
        come to my home.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Eat to your fill, O my
        Siblings of Destiny. Meditate on the Ambrosial Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, within your heart.  || 1 ||   Nanak has entered the
        Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru, who has preserved the honor of
        His Name.  || 2 || 8 || 26 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The True
        Guru has protected my hearth and home, and made them permanent.
        ||  Pause  ||   Whoever slanders these homes, is pre-destined
        by the Creator Lord to be destroyed.  || 1 ||   Slave Nanak seeks
        the Sanctuary of God; the Word of His Shabad is unbreakable and
        infinite.  || 2 || 9 || 27 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The fever
        and sickness are gone, and the diseases are all dispelled. The
        Supreme Lord God has forgiven you, so enjoy the happiness of the
        Saints.  ||  Pause  ||   All joys have entered your world, and
        your mind and body are free of disease. So chant continuously
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord; this is the only potent medicine.
        || 1 ||   So come, and dwell in your home and native land; this
        is such a blessed and auspicious occasion. O Nanak, God is totally
        pleased with you; your time of separation has come to an end.
        || 2 || 10 || 28 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The entanglements
        of Maya do not go along with anyone. Even kings and rulers must
        arise and depart, according to the wisdom of the Saints.  || 
        Pause  ||   Pride goes before the fall - this is a primal
        law. Those who practice corruption and sin, are born into countless
        incarnations, only to die again.  || 1 ||   The Holy Saints chant
        Words of Truth; they meditate continually on the Lord of the Universe.
        Meditating, meditating in remembrance, O Nanak, those who are
        imbued with the color of the Lord's Love are carried across.
        || 2 || 11 || 29 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Perfect Guru
        has blessed me with celestial Samaadhi, bliss and peace. God is
        always my Helper and Companion; I contemplate His Ambrosial Virtues.

        yearn for me. The True Guru and God are totally pleased with me;
        no obstacle blocks my way.  || 1 ||   One who has the Merciful
        Lord God on his side - everyone becomes his slave. Forever
        and ever, O Nanak, glorious greatness rests with the Guru.  ||

        like a house of sand. In no time at all, it is destroyed, like
        the paper drenched with water.  || 1 ||   Listen to me, people:
        behold, and consider this within your mind. The Siddhas, the
        seekers, house-holders and Yogis have forsaken their homes and
        left.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This world is like a dream in the
        night. All that is seen shall perish. Why are you attached to
        it, you fool?  || 2 ||   Where are your brothers and friends?
        Open your eyes and see! Some have gone, and some will go; everyone
        must take his turn.  || 3 ||   Those who serve the Perfect True
        Guru, remain ever-stable at the Door of the Lord. Servant Nanak
        is the Lord's slave; preserve his honor, O Lord, Destroyer
        of ego.  || 4 || 1 || 31 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The glories
        of the world, I cast into the fire. I chant those words, by which
        I may meet my Beloved.  || 1 ||   When God becomes Merciful, then
        He enjoins me to His devotional service. My mind clings to worldly
        desires; meeting with the Guru, I have renounced them.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   I pray with intense devotion, and offer this soul
        to Him. I would sacrifice all other riches, for a moment's
        union with my Beloved.  || 2 ||   Through the Guru, I am rid of
        the five villains, as well as emotional love and hate. My heart
        is illumined, and the Lord has become manifest; night and day,
        I remain awake and aware.  || 3 ||   The blessed soul-bride seeks
        His Sanctuary; her destiny is recorded on her forehead. Says Nanak,
        she obtains her Husband Lord; her body and mind are cooled and
        soothed.  || 4 || 2 || 32 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  One is
        dyed in the color of the Lord's Love, by great good fortune.
        This color is never muddied; no stain ever sticks to it.  || 1
        ||   He finds God, the Giver of peace, with feelings of joy. The
        Celestial Lord blends into his soul, and he can never leave Him.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Old age and death cannot touch him, and
        he shall not suffer pain again. Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar,
        he is satisfied; the Guru makes him immortal.  || 2 ||   He alone
        knows its taste, who tastes the Priceless Name of the Lord. Its
        value cannot be estimated; what can I say with my mouth?  || 3
        ||   Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Supreme
        Lord God. <br>

      <p> The Word of Your Bani is the treasure of virtue. Please bless
        me with the dust of the feet of Your slaves; Nanak is a sacrifice.
        || 4 || 3 || 33 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Keep me under Your
        Protection, God; shower me with Your Mercy. I do not know how
        to serve You; I am just a low-life fool.  || 1 ||   I take pride
        in You, O my Darling Beloved. I am a sinner, continuously making
        mistakes; You are the Forgiving Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I
        make mistakes each and every day. You are the Great Giver; I am
        worthless. I associate with Maya, your hand-maiden, and I renounce
        You, God; such are my actions.  || 2 ||   You bless me with everything,
        showering me with Mercy; And I am such an ungrateful wretch! I
        am attached to Your gifts, but I do not even think of You, O my
        Lord and Master.  || 3 ||   There is none other than You, O Lord,
        Destroyer of fear. Says Nanak, I have come to Your Sanctuary,
        O Merciful Guru; I am so foolish - please, save me!  ||
        4 || 4 || 34 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Don't blame anyone
        else; meditate on your God. Serving Him, great peace is obtained;
        O mind, sing His Praises.  || 1 ||   O Beloved, other than You,
        who else should I ask? You are my Merciful Lord and Master; I
        am filled with all faults.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As You keep me,
        I remain; there is no other way. You are the Support of the unsupported;
        You Name is my only Support.  || 2 ||   One who accepts whatever
        You do as good - that mind is liberated. The entire creation
        is Yours; all are subject to Your Ways.  || 3 ||   I wash Your
        Feet and serve You, if it pleases You, O Lord and Master. Be Merciful,
        O God of Compassion, that Nanak may sing Your Glorious Praises.
        || 4 || 5 || 35 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Death hovers over
        his head, laughing, but the beast does not understand. Entangled
        in conflict, pleasure and egotism, he does not even think of death.
        || 1 ||   So serve your True Guru; why wander around miserable
        and unfortunate? You gaze upon the transitory, beautiful safflower,
        but why do you get attached to it?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You commit
        sins again and again, to gather wealth to spend. But your dust
        shall mix with dust; you shall arise and depart naked.  || 2 ||
        Those for whom you work, will become your spiteful enemies.
        In the end, they will run away from you; why do you burn for them
        in anger?  || 3 ||   He alone becomes the dust of the Lord's
        slaves, who has such good karma upon his forehead. Says Nanak,
        he is released from bondage, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
        || 4 || 6 || 36 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The cripple crosses
        over the mountain, the fool becomes a wise man, and the blind
        man sees the three worlds, by meeting with the True Guru and being
        purified.  || 1 ||   This is the Glory of the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy; listen, O my friends. Filth is washed away,
        millions of sins are dispelled, and the consciousness becomes
        immaculate and pure.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Such is devotional
        worship of the Lord of the Universe, that the ant can overpower
        the elephant. Whoever the Lord makes His own, is blessed with
        the gift of fearlessness.  || 2 || <br>

      <p> The lion becomes a cat, and the mountain looks like a blade of
        grass. Those who worked for half a shell, will be judged very
        wealthy.  || 3 ||   What glorious greatness of Yours can I describe,
        O Lord of infinite excellences? Please bless me with Your Mercy,
        and grant me Your Name; O Nanak, I am lost without the Blessed
        Vision of Your Darshan.  || 4 || 7 || 37 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  He is constantly entangled in pride, conflict, greed and
        tasty flavors. He is involved in deception, fraud, household affairs
        and corruption.  || 1 ||   I have seen this with my eyes, by the
        Grace of the Perfect Guru. Power, property, wealth and youth are
        useless, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Beauty, incense, scented oils, beautiful clothes and foods
        - when they come into contact with the body of the sinner,
        they stink.  || 2 ||   Wandering, wandering around, the soul is
        reincarnated as a human, but this body lasts only for an instant.
        Losing this opportunity, he must wander again through countless
        incarnations.  || 3 ||   By God's Grace, he meets the Guru;
        contemplating the Lord, Har, Har, he is wonderstruck. He is blessed
        with peace, poise and bliss, O Nanak, through the perfect sound
        current of the Naad.  || 4 || 8 || 38 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The feet of the Saints are the boat, to cross over the world-ocean.
        In the wilderness, the Guru places them on the Path, and reveals
        the secrets of the Lord's Mystery.  || 1 ||   O Lord, Har
        Har Har, Har Har Haray, Har Har Har, I love You. While standing
        up, sitting down and sleeping, think of the Lord, Har Har Har.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The five thieves run away, when one joins
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. His investment is intact,
        and he earns great profits; his household is blessed with honor.
        || 2 ||   His position is unmoving and eternal, his anxiety is
        ended, and he sees God everywhere.  || 3 ||   The Virtues of our
        Virtuous Lord and Master are so profound; how many of His Glorious
        Virtues should I speak? Nanak has obtained the Ambrosial Nectar
        of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Company of the Holy.  || 4 || 9
        || 39 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  That life, which has no contact
        with the Holy, is useless. Joining their congregation, all doubts
        are dispelled, and I am emancipated.  || 1 ||   That day, when
        I meet with the Holy - I am a sacrifice to that day. Again
        and again, I sacrifice my body, mind and soul to them.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   They have helped me renounce this ego, and implant
        this humility within myself. This mind has become the dust of
        all men's feet, and my self-conceit has been dispelled.
        || 2 ||   In an instant, I burnt away the ideas of slander and
        ill-will towards others. I see close at hand, the Lord of mercy
        and compassion; He is not far away at all.  || 3 ||   My body
        and mind are cooled and soothed, and now, I am liberated from
        the world. Love, consciousness, the breath of life, wealth and
        everything, O Nanak, are in the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan.  || 4 || 10 || 40 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  I perform
        service for Your slave, O Lord, and wipe his feet with my hair.
        I offer my head to him, and listen to the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord, the source of bliss.  || 1 ||   Meeting You, my mind
        is rejuvenated, so please meet me, O Merciful Lord. Night and
        day, my mind enjoys bliss, contemplating the Lord of Compassion. <br>

      <p> || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God's Holy people are the saviors
        of the world; I grab hold of the hem of their robes. Bless me,
        O God, with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints.  ||
        2 ||   I have no skill or wisdom at all, nor any work to my credit.
        Please, protect me from doubt, fear and emotional attachment,
        and cut away the noose of Death from my neck.  || 3 ||   I beg
        of You, O Lord of Mercy, O my Father, please cherish me! I sing
        Your Glorious Praises, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, O Lord, Home of peace.  || 4 || 11 || 41 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Whatever You wish, You do. Without You, there is
        nothing. Gazing upon Your Glory, the Messenger of Death leaves
        and goes away.  || 1 ||   By Your Grace, one is emancipated, and
        egotism is dispelled. God is omnipotent, possessing all powers;
        He is obtained through the Perfect, Divine Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Searching, searching, searching - without the Naam,
        everything is false. All the comforts of life are found in the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; God is the Fulfiller of
        desires.  || 2 ||   Whatever You attach me to, to that I am attached;
        I have burnt away all my cleverness. You are permeating and pervading
        everywhere, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek. || 3 ||   I ask for
        everything from You, but only the very fortunate ones obtain it.
        This is Nanak's prayer, O God, I live by singing Your Glorious
        Praises.  || 4 || 12 || 42 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Dwelling
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all sinful residues
        are erased. One who is attuned to the Love of God, is not cast
        into the womb of reincarnation.  || 1 ||   Chanting the Name of
        the Lord of the Universe, the tongue becomes holy. The mind and
        body become immaculate and pure, chanting the Chant of the Guru.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Tasting the subtle essence of the Lord,
        one is satisfied; receiving this essence, the mind becomes happy.
        The intellect is brightened and illuminated; turning away from
        the world, the heart-lotus blossoms forth.  || 2 ||   He is cooled
        and soothed, peaceful and content; all his thirst is quenched.
        The mind's wandering in the ten directions is stopped,
        and one dwells in the immaculate place.  || 3 ||   The Savior
        Lord saves him, and his doubts are burnt to ashes. Nanak is blessed
        with the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He finds
        peace, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan.
        || 4 || 13 || 43 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Carry water for
        the Lord's slave, wave the fan over him, and grind his
        corn; then, you shall be happy. Burn in the fire your power, property
        and authority.  || 1 ||   Grasp hold of the feet of the servant
        of the humble Saints. Renounce and abandon the wealthy, the regal
        overlords and kings.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The dry bread of the
        Saints is equal to all treasures. The thirty-six tasty dishes
        of the faithless cynic, are just like poison.  || 2 ||   Wearing
        the old blankets of the humble devotees, one is not naked. But
        by putting on the silk clothes of the faithless cynic, one loses
        one's honor.  || 3 ||   Friendship with the faithless cynic
        breaks down mid-way. But whoever serves the humble servants of
        the Lord, is emancipated here and hereafter.  || 4 ||   Everything
        comes from You, O Lord; You Yourself created the creation. <br>

      <p> Blessed with the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy, Nanak
        sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 5 || 14 || 44 || 
        BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  With my ears, I listen to the Lord, Har,
        Har; I sing the Praises of my Lord and Master. I place my hands
        and my head upon the feet of the Saints, and meditate on the Lord's
        Name.  || 1 ||   Be kind to me, O Merciful God, and bless me with
        this wealth and success. Obtaining the dust of the feet of the
        Saints, I apply it to my forehead.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am
        the lowest of the low, absolutely the lowest; I offer my humble
        prayer. I wash their feet, and renounce my self-conceit; I merge
        in the Saints' Congregation.  || 2 ||   With each and every
        breath, I never forget the Lord; I never go to another. Obtaining
        the Fruitful Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I discard my
        pride and attachment.  || 3 ||   I am embellished with truth,
        contentment, compassion and Dharmic faith. My spiritual marriage
        is fruitful, O Nanak; I am pleasing to my God.  || 4 || 15 ||
        45 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The words of the Holy are eternal
        and unchanging; this is apparent to everyone. That humble being,
        who joins the Saadh Sangat, meets the Sovereign Lord.  || 1 ||
        This faith in the Lord of the Universe, and peace, are found
        by meditating on the Lord. Everyone is speaking in various ways,
        but the Guru has brought the Lord into the home of my self.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   He preserves the honor of those who seek His
        Sanctuary; there is no doubt about this at all. In the field of
        actions and karma, plant the Lord's Name; this opportunity
        is so difficult to obtain!  || 2 ||   God Himself is the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts; He does, and causes everything to be done.
        He purifies so many sinners; this is the natural way of our Lord
        and Master.  || 3 ||   Don't be fooled, O mortal being,
        by the illusion of Maya. O Nanak, God saves the honor of those
        of whom He approves.  || 4 || 16 || 46 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:
        He fashioned you from clay, and made your priceless body. He
        covers the many faults in your mind, and makes you look immaculate
        and pure.  || 1 ||   So why do you forget God from your mind?
        He has done so many good things for you. One who forsakes God,
        and blends himself with another, in the end is blended with dust.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate, meditate in remembrance with each
        and every breath - do not delay! Renounce worldly affairs,
        and merge yourself into God; forsake false loves.  || 2 ||   He
        is many, and He is One; He takes part in the many plays. This
        is as He is, and shall be. So serve that Supreme Lord God, and
        accept the Guru's Teachings.  || 3 ||   God is said to
        be the highest of the high, the greatest of all, our companion.
        Please, let Nanak be the slave of the slave of Your slaves.  ||
        4 || 17 || 47 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord of the Universe
        is my only Support. I have renounced all other hopes. God is All-powerful,
        above all; He is the perfect treasure of virtue.  || 1 ||   The
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Support of the humble servant
        who seeks God's Sanctuary. In their minds, the Saints take
        the Support of the Transcendent Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He
        Himself preserves, and He Himself gives. <br>

      <p> He Himself cherishes. Merciful to the meek, the treasure of mercy,
        He remembers and protects us with each and every breath.  || 2
        ||   Whatever the Creator Lord does is glorious and great. The
        Perfect Guru has instructed me, that peace comes by the Will of
        our Lord and Master.  || 3 ||   Anxieties, worries and calculations
        are dismissed; the Lord's humble servant accepts the Hukam
        of His Command. He does not die, and He does not leave; Nanak
        is attuned to His Love.  || 4 || 18 || 48 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The great fire is put out and cooled; meeting with the
        Guru, sins run away. I fell into the deep dark pit; giving me
        His Hand, He pulled me out.  || 1 ||   He is my friend; I am the
        dust of His Feet. Meeting with Him, I am at peace; He blesses
        me with the gift of the soul.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have now
        received my pre-ordained destiny. Dwelling with the Lord's
        Holy Saints, my hopes are fulfilled.  || 2 ||   The fear of the
        three worlds is dispelled, and I have found my place of rest and
        peace. The all-powerful Guru has taken pity upon me, and the Naam
        has come to dwell in my mind.  || 3 ||   O God, You are the Anchor
        and Support of Nanak. He is the Doer, the Cause of causes; the
        All-powerful Lord God is inaccessible and infinite.  || 4 || 19
        || 49 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who forgets God is filthy,
        poor and low. The fool does not understand the Creator Lord; instead,
        he thinks that he himself is the doer.  || 1 ||   Pain comes,
        when one forgets Him. Peace comes when one remembers God. This
        is the way the Saints are in bliss - they continually sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The high,
        He makes low, and the low, he elevates in an instant. The value
        of the glory of our Lord and Master cannot be estimated.  || 2
        ||   While he gazes upon beautiful dramas and plays, the day of
        his departure dawns. The dream becomes the dream, and his actions
        do not go along with him.  || 3 ||   God is All-powerful, the
        Cause of causes; I seek Your Sanctuary. Day and night, Nanak meditates
        on the Lord; forever and ever he is a sacrifice.  || 4 || 20 ||
        50 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  I carry water on my head, and
        with my hands I wash their feet. Tens of thousands of times, I
        am a sacrifice to them; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of their
        Darshan, I live.  || 1 ||   The hopes which I cherish in my mind
        - my God fulfills them all. With my broom, I sweep the
        homes of the Holy Saints, and wave the fan over them.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The Saints chant the Ambrosial Praises of the Lord;
        I listen, and my mind drinks it in. That sublime essence calms
        and soothes me, and quenches the fire of sin and corruption. 
        || 2 ||   When the galaxy of Saints worship the Lord in devotion,
        I join them, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. I bow in
        reverence to the humble devotees, and apply the dust of their
        feet to my face.  || 3 ||   Sitting down and standing up, I chant
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord; this is what I do. This is Nanak's
        prayer to God, that he may merge in the Lord's Sanctuary.
        || 4 || 21 || 51 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  He alone crosses
        over this world-ocean, who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. <br>

      <p> He dwells with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; by great
        good fortune, he finds the Lord.  || 1 ||   Your slave lives by
        hearing, hearing the Word of Your Bani, chanted by Your humble
        servant. The Guru is revealed in all the worlds; He saves the
        honor of His servant.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God has pulled me
        out of the ocean of fire, and quenched my burning thirst. The
        Guru has sprinkled the Ambrosial Water of the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord; He has become my Helper.  || 2 ||   The pains of birth
        and death are removed, and I have obtained a resting place of
        peace. The noose of doubt and emotional attachment has been snapped;
        I have become pleasing to my God.  || 3 ||   Let no one think
        that there is any other at all; everything is in the Hands of
        God. Nanak has found total peace, in the Society of the Saints.
        || 4 || 22 || 52 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  My bonds have been
        snapped; God Himself has become compassionate. The Supreme Lord
        God is Merciful to the meek; by His Glance of Grace, I am in ecstasy.
        || 1 ||   The Perfect Guru has shown mercy to me, and eradicated
        my pains and illnesses. My mind and body have been cooled and
        soothed, meditating on God, most worthy of meditation.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The Name of the Lord is the medicine to cure all
        disease; with it, no disease afflicts me. In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, the mind and body are tinged with the
        Lord's Love, and I do not suffer pain any longer.  || 2
        ||   I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, lovingly
        centering my inner being on Him. Sinful mistakes are erased and
        I am sanctified, in the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints.  || 3 ||
        Misfortune is kept far away from those who hear and chant the
        Praises of the Lord's Name. Nanak chants the Mahaa Mantra,
        the Great Mantra, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  ||
        4 || 23 || 53 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  From the Fear of God,
        devotion wells up, and deep within, there is peace. Chanting the
        Name of the Lord of the Universe, doubt and delusions are dispelled.
        || 1 ||   One who meets with the Perfect Guru, is blessed with
        peace. So renounce the intellectual cleverness of your mind, and
        listen to the Teachings.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate, meditate,
        meditate in remembrance on the Primal Lord, the Great Giver. May
        I never forget that Primal, Infinite Lord from my mind.  || 2
        ||   I have enshrined love for the Lotus Feet of the Wondrous
        Divine Guru. One who is blessed by Your Mercy, God, is committed
        to Your service.  || 3 ||   I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, the
        treasure of wealth, and my mind and body are in bliss. Nanak never
        forgets God, the Lord of supreme bliss.  || 4 || 24 || 54 || 
        BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Desire is stilled, and egotism is gone;
        fear and doubt have run away. I have found stability, and I am
        in ecstasy; the Guru has blessed me with Dharmic faith.  || 1
        ||   Worshipping the Perfect Guru in adoration, my anguish is
        eradicated. My body and mind are totally cooled and soothed; I
        have found peace, O my brother.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have awakened
        from sleep, chanting the Name of the Lord; gazing upon Him, I
        am filled with wonder. Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, I am
        satisfied. How wondrous is its taste!  || 2 ||   I myself am liberated,
        and my companions swim across; my family and ancestors are also
        saved. Service to the Divine Guru is fruitful; it has made me
        pure in the Court of the Lord.  || 3 ||   I am lowly, without
        a master, ignorant, worthless and without virtue. <br>

      <p> Nanak has been blessed with God's Mercy; God has made him
        His Slave.  || 4 || 25 || 55 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        Lord is the Hope and Support of His devotees; there is nowhere
        else for them to go. O God, Your Name is my power, realm, relatives
        and riches.  || 1 ||   God has granted His Mercy, and saved His
        slaves. The slanderers rot in their slander; they are seized by
        the Messenger of Death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Saints meditate
        on the One Lord, and no other. They offer their prayers to the
        One Lord, who is pervading and permeating all places.  || 2 ||
        I have heard this old story, spoken by the devotees, that all
        the wicked are cut apart into pieces, while His humble servants
        are blessed with honor.  || 3 ||   Nanak speaks the true words,
        which are obvious to all. God's servants are under God's
        Protection; they have absolutely no fear.  || 4 || 26 || 56 ||
        BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  God breaks the bonds which hold us;
        He holds all power in His hands. No other actions will bring release;
        save me, O my Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   I have entered Your
        Sanctuary, O Perfect Lord of Mercy. Those whom You preserve and
        protect, O Lord of the Universe, are saved from the trap of the
        world.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Hope, doubt, corruption and emotional
        attachment - in these, he is engrossed. The false material
        world abides in his mind, and he does not understand the Supreme
        Lord God.  || 2 ||  O Perfect Lord of Supreme Light, all beings
        belong to You. As You keep us, we live, O infinite, inaccessible
        God.  || 3 ||   Cause of causes, All-powerful Lord God, please
        bless me with Your Name. Nanak is carried across in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, singing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4 || 27 || 57 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Who? Who has not fallen, by placing their hopes in you?
        You are enticed by the great enticer - this is the way
        to hell!  || 1 ||   O vicious mind, no faith can be placed in
        you; you are totally intoxicated. The donkey's leash is
        only removed, after the load is placed on his back.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   You destroy the value of chanting, intensive meditation
        and self-discipline; you shall suffer in pain, beaten by the Messenger
        of Death. You do not meditate, so you shall suffer the pains of
        reincarnation, you shameless buffoon!  || 2 ||   The Lord is your
        Companion, your Helper, your Best Friend; but you disagree with
        Him. You are in love with the five thieves; this brings terrible
        pain.  || 3 ||   Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Saints, who
        have conquered their minds. He gives body, wealth and everything
        to the slaves of God.  || 4 || 28 || 58 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Try to meditate, and contemplate the source of peace, and
        bliss will come to you. Chanting, and meditating on the Name of
        the Lord of the Universe, perfect understanding is achieved. 
        || 1 ||   Meditating on the Lotus Feet of the Guru, and chanting
        the Name of the Lord, I live. Worshipping the Supreme Lord God
        in adoration, my mouth drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   All beings and creatures dwell in peace; the minds
        of all yearn for the Lord. Those who continually remember the
        Lord, do good deeds for others; they harbor no ill will towards
        anyone.  || 2 || <br>

      <p> Blessed is that place, and blessed are those who dwell there,
        where they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Sermon and
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung there very often;
        there is peace, poise and tranquility.  || 3 ||   In my mind,
        I never forget the Lord; He is the Master of the masterless. Nanak
        has entered the Sanctuary of God; everything is in His hands.
        || 4 || 29 || 59 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The One who bound
        you in the womb and then released you, placed you in the world
        of joy. Contemplate His Lotus Feet forever, and you shall be cooled
        and soothed.  || 1 ||   In life and in death, this Maya is of
        no use. He created this creation, but rare are those who enshrine
        love for Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O mortal, the Creator Lord
        made summer and winter; He saves you from the heat. From the ant,
        He makes an elephant; He reunites those who have been separated.
        || 2 ||   Eggs, wombs, sweat and earth - these are God's
        workshops of creation. It is fruitful for all to practice contemplation
        of the Lord.  || 3 ||   I cannot do anything; O God, I seek the
        Sanctuary of the Holy. Guru Nanak pulled me up, out of the deep,
        dark pit, the intoxication of attachment.  || 4 || 30 || 60 ||
        BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Searching, searching, I wander around
        searching, in the woods and other places. He is undeceivable,
        imperishable and inscrutable; such is my Lord God.  || 1 ||  
        When shall I behold my God, and delight my soul? Even better than
        being awake, is the dream in which I dwell with God.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Listening to the Shaastras teaching about the four
        social classes and the four stages of life, I grow thirsty for
        the Blessed Vision of the Lord. He has no form or outline, and
        He is not made of the five elements; our Lord and Master is imperishable.
        || 2 ||   How rare are those Saints and great Yogis, who describe
        the beautiful form of the Lord. Blessed, blessed are they, whom
        the Lord meets in His Mercy.  || 3 ||   They know that He is deep
        within, and outside as well; their doubts are dispelled. O Nanak,
        God meets those, whose karma is perfect.  || 4 || 31 || 61 ||
        BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  All beings and creatures are totally
        pleased, gazing on God's glorious radiance. The True Guru
        has paid off my debt; He Himself did it.  || 1 ||   Eating and
        expending it, it is always available; the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad is inexhaustible. Everything is perfectly arranged; it
        is never exhausted.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, I worship and adore the Lord, the infinite
        treasure. He does not hesitate to bless me with Dharmic faith,
        wealth, sexual success and liberation.  || 2 ||   The devotees
        worship and adore the Lord of the Universe with single-minded
        love. They gather in the wealth of the Lord's Name, which
        cannot be estimated.  || 3 ||   O God, I seek Your Sanctuary,
        the glorious greatness of God. Nanak: Your end or limitation cannot
        be found, O Infinite World-Lord.  || 4 || 32 || 62 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate, meditate in remembrance of the Perfect
        Lord God, and your affairs shall be perfectly resolved. In Kartaarpur,
        the City of the Creator Lord, the Saints dwell with the Creator.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   No obstacles will block your way, when you
        offer your prayers to the Guru. </p>
