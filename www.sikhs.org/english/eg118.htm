      <p> SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Name of the Lord is cooling and soothing.
        Searching, searching the Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees,
        the Holy Saints have realized this.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the
        worlds of Shiva, Brahma and Indra, I wandered around, burning
        up with envy. Meditating, meditating in remembrance on my Lord
        and Master, I became cool and calm; my pains, sorrows and doubts
        are gone.  || 1 ||   Whoever has been saved in the past or the
        present, was saved through loving devotional worship of the Divine
        Lord. This is Nanak's prayer: O Dear God, please let me
        serve the humble Saints.  || 2 || 52 || 75 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH
        MEHL;  O my tongue, sing the Ambrosial Praises of the Lord. Chant
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, listen to the Lord's Sermon,
        and chant God's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So gather in
        the jewel, the wealth of the Lord's Name; love God with
        your mind and body. You must realize that all other wealth is
        false; this alone is the true purpose of life.  || 1 ||   He is
        the Giver of the soul, the breath of life and liberation; lovingly
        tune in to the One and Only Lord. Says Nanak, I have entered His
        Sanctuary; He gives sustenance to all.  || 2 || 53 || 76 ||  
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  I cannot do anything else. I have taken
        this Support, meeting the Saints; I have entered the Sanctuary
        of the One Lord of the World.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The five wicked
        enemies are within this body; they lead the mortal to practice
        evil and corruption. He has infinite hope, but his days are numbered,
        and old age is sapping his strength.  || 1 ||   He is the Help
        of the helpless, the Merciful Lord, the Ocean of Peace, the Destroyer
        of all pains and fears. Slave Nanak longs for this blessing, that
        he may live, gazing upon the Feet of God.  || 2 || 54 || 77 ||
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Without the Lord's Name, flavors
        are tasteless and insipid. Sing the Sweet Ambrosial Praises of
        the Lord's Kirtan; day and night, the Sound-current of
        the Naad will resonate and resound.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditating
        in remembrance on the Lord, total peace and bliss are obtained,
        and all sorrows are taken away. The profit of the Lord, Har, Har,
        is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; so load
        it and bring it on home.  || 1 ||   He is the Highest of all,
        the Highest of the high; His celestial ecomony has no limit. Nanak
        cannot even express His Glorious Grandeur; gazing upon Him, he
        is wonder-struck.  || 2 || 55 || 78 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The mortal came to hear and chant the Word of the Guru's
        Bani. But he has forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and
        he has become attached to other temptations. His life is totally
        worthless!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O my unconscious mind, become
        conscious and figure it out; the Saints speak the Unspoken Speech
        of the Lord. So gather in your profits - worship and adore
        the Lord within your heart; your coming and going in reincarnation
        shall end.  || 1 ||   Efforts, powers and clever tricks are Yours;
        if You bless me with them, I repeat Your Name. They alone are
        devotees, and they alone are attached to devotional worship, O
        Nanak, who are pleasing to God.  || 2 || 56 || 79 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Those who deal in the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        are wealthy. So become a partner with them, and earn the wealth
        of the Naam. <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Abandon your deception, and go beyond vengeance; see God
        who is always with you. Deal only in this true wealth and gather
        in this true wealth, and you shall never suffer loss.  || 1 ||
        Eating and consuming it, it is never exhausted; God's
        treasures are overflowing. Says Nanak, you shall go home to the
        Court of the Supreme Lord God with honor and respect.  || 2 ||
        57 || 80 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O Dear God, I am wretched
        and helpless! From what source did you create humans? This is
        Your Glorious Grandeur.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are the Giver
        of the soul and the breath of life to all; Your Infinite Glories
        cannot be spoken.You are the Beloved Lord of all, the Cherisher
        of all, the Support of all hearts.  || 1 ||   No one knows Your
        state and extent. You alone created the expanse of the Universe.
        Please, give me a seat in the boat of the Holy; O Nanak, thus
        I shall cross over this terrifying world-ocean, and reach the
        other shore.  || 2 || 58 || 81 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  One
        who comes to the Lord's Sanctuary is very fortunate. He
        knows of no other than the One Lord. He has renounced all other
        efforts.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He worships and adores the Lord,
        Har, Har, in thought, word and deed; in the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, he finds peace. He enjoys bliss and pleasure,
        and savors the Unspoken Speech of the Lord; he merges intuitively
        into the True Lord.  || 1 ||   Sublime and exalted is the speech
        of one whom the Lord, in His Mercy makes His Own. Those who are
        imbued with God in the state of Nirvaanaa, O Nanak, are emancipated
        in the Saadh Sangat.  || 2 || 59 || 82 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Since I grasped hold of the Sanctuary of the Holy, my mind is
        illuminated with tranquility, peace and poise, and I am rid of
        all my pain.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Please be merciful to me, O
        Lord, and bless me with Your Name; this is the prayer I offer
        to You. I have forgotten my other occupations; remembering God
        in meditation, I have obtained the true profit.  || 1 ||   We
        shall merge again into the One from whom we came; He is the Essence
        of Being. Says Nanak, the Guru has eradicated my doubt; my light
        has merged into the Light.  || 2 || 60 || 83 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  O my tongue, sing the Praises of the Lord. Abandon all
        other tastes and flavors; the taste of the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is so sublime.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Enshrine the Lord's
        Lotus Feet within your heart; let yourself be lovingly attuned
        to the One Lord. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        you shall become immaculate and pure; you shall not come to be
        reincarnated again.  || 1 ||   You are the Support of the soul
        and the breath of life; You are the Home of the homeless. With
        each and every breath, I dwell on the Lord, Har, Har; O Nanak,
        I am forever a sacrifice to Him.  || 2 || 61 || 84 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  To meditate on the Lotus Feet of the Lord of the
        Universe is heaven for me. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, is the treasure of liberation and the Lord's
        Ambrosial Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Lord God, please be kind
        to me, that I may hear with my ears Your Sublime and Exalted Sermon.
        My cycle of coming and going is finally completed, and I have
        attained peace and tranquility.  || 1 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> Searching and searching, I have realized the essence of reality:
        devotional worship is the most sublime fulfillment. Says Nanak,
        without the Name of the One Lord, all other ways are imperfect.
        || 2 || 62 || 85 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The True Guru is
        the True Giver. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan,
        all my pains are dispelled. I am a sacrifice to His Lotus Feet.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Supreme Lord God is True, and True are
        the Holy Saints; the Name of the Lord is steady and stable. So
        worship the Imperishable, Supreme Lord God with love, and sing
        His Glorious Praises.  || 1 ||   The limits of the Inaccessible,
        Unfathomable Lord cannot be found; He is the Support of all hearts.
        O Nanak, chant, &quot;Waaho! Waaho!&quot; to Him, who has no
        end or limitation.  || 2 || 63 || 86 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Feet of the Guru abide within my mind. My Lord and Master
        is permeating and pervading all places; He dwells nearby, close
        to all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Breaking my bonds, I have lovingly
        tuned in to the Lord, and now the Saints are pleased with me.
        This precious human life has been sanctified, and all my desires
        have been fulfilled.  || 1 ||   O my God, whoever You bless with
        Your Mercy - he alone sings Your Glorious Praises. Servant
        Nanak is a sacrifice to that person who sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord of the Universe, twenty-four hours a day.  || 2 ||
        64 || 87 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  A person is judged to be
        alive, only if he sees the Lord. Please be merciful to me, O my
        Enticing Beloved Lord, and erase the record of my doubts.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   By speaking and listening, tranquility and peace
        are not found at all. What can anyone learn without faith? One
        who renounces God and longs for another - his face is blackened
        with filth.  || 1 ||   One who is blessed with the wealth of our
        Lord and Master, the Embodiment of Peace, does not believe in
        any other religious doctrine. O Nanak, one whose mind is fascinated
        and intoxicated with the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan
        - his tasks are perfectly accomplished.  || 2 || 65 ||
        88 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditate in remembrance on the
        Naam, the Name of the One Lord. In this way, the sinful residues
        of your past mistakes shall be burnt off in an instant. It is
        like giving millions in charity, and bathing at sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Entangled in other affairs,
        the mortal suffers uselessly in sorrow. Without the Lord, wisdom
        is useless. The mortal is freed of the anguish of death and birth,
        meditating and vibrating on the Blissful Lord of the Universe.
        || 1 ||   I seek Your Sancutary, O Perfect Lord, Ocean of Peace.
        Please be merciful, and bless me with this gift. Meditating, meditating
        in remembrance on God, Nanak lives; his egotistical pride has
        been eradicated.  || 2 || 66 || 89 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        He alone is a Dhoorat, who is attached to the Primal Lord God.
        He alone is a Dhurandhar, and he alone is a Basundhar, who is
        absorbed in the sublime essence of Love of the One Lord.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   One who practices deception and does not know
        where true profit lies is not a Dhoorat - he is a fool.
        He abandons profitable enterprises and is involved in unprofitable
        ones. He does not meditate on the Beauteous Lord God.  || 1 ||
        He alone is clever and wise and a religious scholar, he alone
        is a brave warrior, and he alone is intelligent, who chants the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy. O Nanak, he alone is approved.  || 2 || 67 || 90 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord, Har, Har, is the life of the
        humble Saints. Instead of enjoying corrupt pleasures, they drink
        in the Ambrosial Essence of the Name of the Lord, the Ocean of
        Peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They gather up the priceless wealth
        of the Lord's Name, and weave it into the fabric of their
        mind and body. Imbued with the Lord's Love, their minds
        are dyed in the deep crimson color of devotional love; they are
        intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord's Name.
        || 1 ||   As the fish is immersed in water, they are absorbed
        in the Lord's Name. O Nanak, the Saints are like the sparrow-hawks;
        they are comforted, drinking in the drops of the Lord's
        Name.  || 2 || 68 || 91 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Without the
        Name of the Lord, the mortal is a ghost. All the actions he commits
        are just shackles and bonds.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without serving
        God, one who serves another wastes his time uselessly. When the
        Messenger of Death comes to kill you, O mortal, what will your
        condition be then?  || 1 ||   Please protect Your slave, O Eternally
        Merciful Lord. O Nanak, my God is the Treasure of Peace; He is
        the wealth and property of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy.  || 2 || 69 || 92 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  My mind and
        body deal only in the Lord. Imbued with loving devotional worship,
        I sing His Glorious Praises; I am not affected by worldly affairs.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This is the way of life of the Holy Saint:
        he listens to the Kirtan, the Praises of his Lord and Master,
        and meditates in remembrance on Him. He implants the Lord's
        Lotus Feet deep within his heart; worship of the Lord is the support
        of his breath of life.  || 1 ||   O God, Merciful to the meek,
        please hear my prayer, and shower Your Blessings upon me. I continually
        chant the treasure of the Naam with my tongue; Nanak is forever
        a sacrifice.  || 2 || 70 || 93 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Without
        the Name of the Lord, his intellect is shallow. He does not meditate
        in remembrance on the Lord, his Lord and Master; the blind fool
        suffers in terrible agony.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He does not embrace
        love for the Name of the Lord; he is totally attached to various
        religious robes. His attachments are shattered in an instant;
        when the pitcher is broken, the water runs out.  || 1 ||   Please
        bless me, that I may worship You in loving devotion. My mind is
        absorbed and intoxicated with Your Delicious Love. Nanak, Your
        slave, has entered Your Sanctuary; without God, there is no other
        at all.  || 2 || 71 || 94 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  In my mind,
        I think about that moment, when I join the Gathering of the Friendly
        Saints, constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of
        the Universe.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Without vibrating and meditating
        on the Lord, whatever deeds you do will be useless. The Perfect
        Embodiment of Supreme Bliss is so sweet to my mind. Without Him,
        there is no other at all.  || 1 ||   Chanting, deep meditation,
        austere self-discipline, good deeds and other techniques to being
        peace - they are not equal to even a tiny bit of the Lord's
        Name. Nanak's mind is pierced through by the Lotus Feet
        of the Lord; it is absorbed in His Lotus Feet.  || 2 || 72 ||
        95 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  My God is always with me; He is
        the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. <br>

      <p> I find happiness in the world hereafter, and peace and pleasure
        in this world, meditating in remembrance on the Name of my Lord
        and Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is my Best Friend,
        my Buddy, my Companion. I sing the Glorious Praises of my Sovereign
        Lord King. I shall not forget Him in my heart, even for an instant;
        I have met with the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||   In His Mercy, He
        protects His slave; all beings and creatures are in His Power.
        One who is lovingly attuned to the One, the Perfect Transcendent
        Lord God, O Nanak, is rid of all fear.  || 2 || 73 || 96 ||  
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who has the Lord's Power on
        his side - all his desires are fulfilled, and no pain afflicts
        him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That humble devotee is a slave of his
        God, who listens to Him, and so lives. I have made the effort
        to gaze upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; it is obtained
        only by good karma.  || 1 ||   It is only by Guru's Grace
        that I see His Vision with my eyes. Please bless Nanak with this
        Gift, that he may wash the Feet of the Saints, and so live.  ||
        2 || 74 || 97 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  I live by singing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord. Please be Merciful to me, O my Loving
        Lord of the Universe, that I may never forget You.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   My mind, body, wealth and all are Yours, O my Lord and Master;
        there is nowhere else for me at all. As You keep me, so do I survive;
        I eat and I wear whatever You give me.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; I shall
        never again fall into reincarnation. Slave Nanak seeks Your Sancuary,
        Lord; as it pleases Your Will, so do You guide him.  || 2 || 75
        || 98 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my mind, the Naam is the most
        sublime peace. Other affairs of Maya are corrupt. They are nothing
        more than dust.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The mortal has fallen into
        the deep dark pit of household attachment; it is a horrible, dark
        hell. He wanders in various incarnations, growing weary; he wanders
        through them again and again.  || 1 ||   O Purifier of sinners,
        O Lover of Your devotees, please shower Your Mercy on Your meek
        servant. With palms pressed together, Nanak begs for this blessing:
        O Lord, please save me in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy.  || 2 || 76 || || 99 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Glorious
        Radiance of the Lord has spread out everywhere. The doubts of
        my mind and body are all erased, and I am rid of the three diseases.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My thirst is quenched, and my hopes have
        all been fulfilled; my sorrows and sufferings are over. Singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Unmoving, Eternal, Unchanging Lord
        God, my mind, body and soul are comforted and encouraged.  ||
        1 ||   Sexual desire, anger, greed, pride and envy are destroyed
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. He is the Lover
        of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear; O Nanak, He is our Mother
        and Father.  || 2 || 77 || 100 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Without
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the world is miserable. Like a
        dog, its desires are never satisfied; it clings to the ashes of
        corruption.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Administering the intoxicating
        drug, God Himself leads the mortals astray; they are reincarnated
        again and again. He does not meditate in remembrance on the Lord,
        even for an instant, and so the Messenger of Death makes him suffer.
        || 1 ||   Please be merciful to me, O Destroyer of the pains
        of the meek and the poor; let me be the dust of the feet of the
        Saints. <br>

      <p> Slave Nanak asks for the Blessed Vision of God. It is the Support
        of his mind and body.  || 2 || 78 || 101 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Without the Name of the Lord, the soul is polluted. The
        True Lord God has Himself administered the intoxicating drug of
        corruption, and led the mortal astray.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Wandering
        through millions of incarnations in countless ways, he does not
        find stability anywhere. The faithless cynic does not intuitively
        meet with the Perfect True Guru; he continues coming and going
        in reincarnation.  || 1 ||   Please save me, O All-powerful Lord
        God, O Great Giver; O God, You are Inaccessible and Infinite.
        Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, to cross over the terrible world-ocean,
        and reach the other shore.  || 2 || 79 || 102 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  To chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord is Sublime. In
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on the Transcendent
        Lord God; The taste of His essence is Ambrosial Nectar.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Meditating in remembrance on the One Unmoving,
        Eternal, Unchanging Lord God, the intoxication of Maya wears off.
        One who is blessed with intuitive peace and poise, and the vibrations
        of the Unstruck Celestial Bani, never suffers again.  || 1 ||
        Even Brahma and his sons sing God's Praises; Sukdayv
        and Prahlaad sing His Praises as well. Drinking in the fascinating
        Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's sublime essence, Nanak meditates
        on the Amazing Lord.  || 2 || 80 || 103 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        He commits many millions of sins. Day and night, he does not
        get tired of them, and he never finds release.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   He carries on his head a terrible, heavy load of sin and
        corruption. In an instant, he is exposed. The Messenger of Death
        seizes him by his hair.  || 1 ||   He is consigned to countless
        forms of reincarnation, into beasts, ghosts, camels and donkeys.
        Vibrating and meditating on the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, you shall never be struck
        or harmed at all.  || 2 || 81 || 104 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        He is so blind! He is eating loads of poison. His eyes, ears
        and body are totally exhausted; he shall lose his breath in an
        instant.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Making the poor suffer, he fills
        his belly, but the wealth of Maya shall not go with him. Committing
        sinful mistakes again and again, he regrets and repents, but he
        can never give them up.  || 1 ||   The Messenger of Death comes
        to slaughter the slanderer; he beats him on his head. O Nanak,
        he cuts himself with his own dagger, and damages his own mind.
        || 2 || 82 || 105 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The slanderer is
        destroyed in mid-stream. Our Lord and Master is the Saving Grace,
        the Protector of His humble servants; those who have turned their
        backs on the Guru are overtaken by death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        No one listens to what he says; he is not allowed to sit anywhere.
        He suffers in pain here, and falls into hell hereafter. He wanders
        in endless reincarnations.  || 1 ||  He has become infamous across
        worlds and galaxies; he receives according to what he has done.
        Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Fearless Creator Lord; he sings
        His Glorious Praises in ecstasy and bliss.  || 2 || 83 || 106
        ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Desire plays itself out in so many
        ways. <br>

      <p> But it is not fulfilled at all, and in the end, it dies, exhausted.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   It does not produce tranquility, peace and
        poise; this is the way it works. He does not know what belongs
        to him, and to others. He burns in sexual desire and anger.  ||
        1 ||   The world is enveloped by an ocean of pain; O Lord, please
        save Your slave! Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of Your Lotus Feet;
        Nanak is forever and ever a sacrifice.  || 2 || 84 || 107 || 
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O sinner, who taught you to sin? You do
        not contemplate your Lord and Master, even for an instant; it
        was He who gave you your body and soul.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        Eating, drinking and sleeping, you are happy, but contemplating
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you are miserable. In the womb
        of your mother, you cried and whined like a wretch.  || 1 || 
        And now, bound by great pride and corruption, you shall wander
        in endless incarnations. You have forgotten the Lord of the Universe;
        what misery will be your lot now? O Nanak, peace is found by realizing
        the sublime state of the Lord.  || 2 || 85 || 108 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, I have grasped the Protection, the Sanctuary
        of the Lord's Feet. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His
        Darshan, my mind is fascinated, and evil-mindedness is taken away.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is Unfathomable, Incomprehensible, Exalted
        and High, Eternal and Imperishable; His worth cannot be appraised.
        Gazing upon Him, gazing upon Him in the water and on the land,
        my mind has blossomed forth in ecstasy. He is totally pervading
        and permeating all.  || 1 ||   Merciful to the meek, my Beloved,
        Enticer of my mind; meeting with the Holy, He is known. Meditating,
        meditating in remembrance on the Lord, Nanak lives; the Messenger
        of Death cannot catch or torment him.  || 2 || 86 || 109 ||  
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, my mind is intoxicated. Gazing
        upon the Merciful Lord, I am filled with bliss and peace; imbued
        with the sublime essence of the Lord, I am intoxicated.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   I have become spotless and pure, singing the Sacred
        Praises of the Lord; I shall never again be dirtied. My awareness
        is focused on the Lotus Feet of God; I have met the Infinite,
        Supreme Being.  || 1 ||   Taking me by the hand, He has given
        me everything; He has lit up my lamp. O Nanak, savoring the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, I have become detached; my generations have
        been carried across as well.  || 2 || 87 || 110 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, by meditating in remembrance on some other,
        the mortal dies. Forsaking the Lord of the Universe, the Giver
        of souls, the mortal is engrossed and entangled in Maya.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he
        walks on some other path, and falls into the most horrible hell.
        He suffers uncounted punishments, and wanders from womb to womb
        in reincarnation.  || 1 ||   They alone are wealthy, and they
        alone are honorable, who are absorbed in the Sanctuary of the
        Lord. By Guru's Grace, O Nanak, they conquer the world;
        they do not come and go in reincarnation ever again.  || 2 ||
        88 || 111 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord has cut down the
        crooked tree of my deceit. The forest of doubt is burnt away in
        an instant, by the fire of the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Sexual desire, anger and slander are gone; in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have beaten them and driven
        them out. <br>

      <p> The Gurmukh is successful in this priceless human life; he shall
        not lose it in the gamble ever again.  || 1 ||   Twenty-four hours
        a day, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and contemplate
        the Perfect Word of the Shabad. Servant Nanak is the slave of
        Your slaves; over and over again, he bows in humble reverence
        to You.  || 2 || 89 || 112 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  This Holy
        Book is the home of the Transcendent Lord God. Whoever sings the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, has the perfect knowledge of God.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Siddhas and seekers and all the silent sages
        long for the Lord, but those who meditate on Him are rare. That
        person, unto whom my Lord and Master is merciful - all
        his tasks are perfectly accomplished.  || 1 ||   One whose heart
        is filled with the Lord, the Destroyer of fear, knows the whole
        world. May I never forget You, even for an instant, O my Creator
        Lord; Nanak begs for this blessing.  || 2 || 90 || 113 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The rain has fallen everywhere. Singing the Lord's
        Praises with ecstasy and bliss, the Perfect Lord is revealed.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   On all four sides and in the ten directions,
        the Lord is an ocean. There is no place where He does not exist.
        O Perfect Lord God, Ocean of Mercy, You bless all with the gift
        of the soul.  || 1 ||   True, True, True is my Lord and Master;
        True is the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. True are those
        humble beings, within whom faith wells up; O Nanak, they are not
        deluded by doubt.  || 2 || 91 || 114 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        O Dear Lord of the Universe, You are the Support of my breath
        of life. You are my Best Friend and Companion, my Help and Support;
        You are my family.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You placed Your Hand
        on my forehead; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        I sing Your Glorious Praises. By Your Grace, I have obtained all
        fruits and rewards; I meditate on the Lord's Name with
        delight.  || 1 ||   The True Guru has laid the eternal foundation;
        it shall never be shaken. Guru Nanak has become merciful to me,
        and I have been blessed with the treasure of absolute peace. 
        || 2 || 92 || 115 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Only the true merchandise
        of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, stays with you. Sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, the treasure of wealth, and earn your profit;
        in the midst of corruption, remain untouched.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   All beings and creatures find contentment, meditating on
        their God. The priceless jewel of infinite worth, this human life,
        is won, and they are not consigned to reincarnation ever again.
        || 1 ||   When the Lord of the Universe shows His kindness and
        compassion, the mortal finds the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, Nanak has found the wealth of the Lotus Feet of the
        Lord; he is imbued with the Love of God.  || 2 || 93 || 116 ||
        SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, I am wonder-struck, gazing
        upon the Lord. My mind is enticed by the unstruck celestial melody;
        its flavor is amazing!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is my Mother,
        Father and Relative. My mind delights in the Lord. Singing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, all my illusions are dispelled.  || 1
        ||   I am lovingly attached to His Lotus Feet; my doubt and fear
        are totally consumed. Servant Nanak has taken the Support of the
        One Lord. <br>

      <p> He shall not wander in reincarnation ever again.  || 2 || 94 ||
        117 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, I am totally intoxicated
        with the Lord's Feet. I know of none other than the Lord.
        I have totally burnt off my sense of duality.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   To abandon the Lord of the World, and become involved with
        anything else, is to fall into the pit of corruption. My mind
        is enticed, thirsty for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. He
        has lifted me up and out of hell.  || 1 ||   By the Grace of the
        Saints, I have met the Lord, the Giver of peace; the noise of
        egotism has been stilled. Slave Nanak is imbued with the Love
        of the Lord; the forests of his mind and body have blossomed forth.
        || 2 || 95 || 118 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The false dealings
        are finished. Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        and meditate, vibrate on the Lord. This is the most excellent
        thing in the world.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Here and hereafter,
        you shall never waver; enshrine the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        within your heart. The boat of the Guru's Feet is found
        by great good fortune; it shall carry you across the world-ocean.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Infinite Lord is totally permeating
        and pervading the water, the land and the sky. Drink in the Ambrosial
        Nectar of the Lord's Name; O Nanak, all other tastes are
        bitter.  || 2 || 96 || 119 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  You whine
        and cry - you are intoxicated with the great corruption
        of attachment and pride, but you do not remember the Lord in meditation.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who meditate on the Lord in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy - the guilt of their minstakes
        is burnt away. Fruitful is the body, and blessed is the birth
        of those who merge with God.  || 1 ||   The four great blessings,
        and the eighteen supernatural spiritual powers - above
        all these are the Holy Saints. Slave Nanak longs for the dust
        of the feet of the humble; attached to the hem of His robe, he
        is saved.  || 2 || 97 || 120 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord's
        humble servants yearn for the Lord's Name. In thought,
        word and deed, they long for this peace, to gaze with their eyes
        upon the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   You are Endless, O God, my Supreme Lord and Master; Your
        state cannot be known. My mind is pierced through by the Love
        of Your Lotus Feet; this is everything to me - I enshrine
        it deep within my being.  || 1 ||   In the Vedas, the Puraanas
        and the Simritees, the humble and the Holy chant this Bani with
        their tongues. Chanting the Lord's Name, O Nanak, I am
        emancipated; other teachings of duality are useless.  || 2 ||
        98 || 121 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  A fly! You are just a fly,
        created by the Lord. Wherever it stinks, you land there; you suck
        in the most toxic stench.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You don't
        stay put anywhere; I have seen this with my eyes. You have not
        spared anyone, except the Saints - the Saints are on the
        side of the Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||   You have enticed
        all beings and creatures; no one knows You, except the Saints.
        Slave Nanak is imbued with the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
        Focusing his consciousness on the Word of the Shabad, he realizes
        the Presence of the True Lord.  || 2 || 99 || 122 ||   SAARANG,
        FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, the noose of Death has been cut away.
        Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have found total peace.
        I remain unattached in the midst of my household. <br>

      <p> || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Granting His Grace, He has made me His Own.
        The thirst for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan wells up within
        me. Joining the Society of the Saints, I sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord; I have given up other hopes.  || 1 ||   The Saint
        has pulled me out of the utterly desolate wilderness, and shown
        me the path. Gazing upon His Darshan, all sins are taken away;
        Nanak is blessed with the jewel of the Lord.  || 2 || 100 || 123
        ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O mother, I am involved with the Love
        of the Lord; I am intoxicated with it. My mind has such a longing
        and thirst for the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of my Beauteous
        Lord. No one can break this.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is
        my breath of life, honor, spouse, parent, child, relative, wealth
        - everything. Cursed is this body of bones, this pile of
        maggots and manure, if it knows any other than the Lord.  || 1
        ||   The Destroyer of the pains of the poor has become merciful
        to me, by the power of the karma of my past actions. Nanak seeks
        the Sanctuary of God, the Treasure, the Ocean of Mercy; my subservience
        to others is past.  || 2 ||  101 || 124 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Lord's melody is noble and sublime. The Lotus Feet
        of my Lord and Master are incomparably beautiful. Meditating on
        them, one becomes Holy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Just by thinking
        of the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the Lord of the World, the
        dirty residues of sins are washed away. The Lord cuts down and
        weeds out the corruption of the cycle of birth and death.  ||
        1 ||   How rare is that person who has such pre-ordained destiny,
        to find the Lord. Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Creator,
        the Lord of the Universe - O Nanak, this is Truth.  ||
        2 || 102 || 125 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  The intellect of one
        who dwells on the Name of the Lord is excellent. One who forgets
        the Lord and becomes involved with some other - all his
        showy pretensions are false.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditate, vibrate
        on our Lord and Master in the Company of the Holy, and your sins
        shall be eradicated. When the Lord's Lotus Feet abide within
        the heart, the mortal is never again caught in the cycle of death
        and birth.  || 1 ||   He showers us with His kindness and compassion;
        He saves and protects those who take the Support of the Naam,
        the Name of the One Lord. Meditating in remembrance on Him, day
        and night, O Nanak, your face shall be radiant in the Court of
        the Lord.  || 2 || 103 || 126 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  Honored
        - you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. Join the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord; your egotistical pride will be totally dispelled.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Showering His kindness and compassion, He
        shall make you His Own. As Gurmukh, your spiritual wisdom shall
        be perfect. All peace and all sorts of ecstasy are obtained, by
        meditating on the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of my Lord and Master.
        || 1 ||   She who dwells close to her Lord is always the pure,
        happy soul-bride; she is famous in the ten directions. She is
        imbued with the Love of her Loving Beloved Lord; Nanak is a sacrifice
        to her.  || 2 || 104 || 127 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  O Lord,
        I take the Support of Your Lotus Feet. You are my Best Friend
        and Companion; I am with You. You are our Protector, O Lord of
        the Universe.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are mine, and I am Yours;
        here and hereafter, You are my Saving Grace. You are Endess and
        Infinite, O my Lord and Master; by Guru's Grace, a few
        understand.  || 1 ||   Without being spoken, without being told,
        You know all, O Searcher of hearts. <br>

        are corrupt. Pride, attachment and desire are not quenched; the
        world is in the grip of death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Eating, drinking,
        laughing and sleeping, life passes uselessly. The mortal wanders
        in reincarnation, burning in the hellish environment of the womb;
        in the end, he is destroyed by death.  || 1 ||   He practices
        fraud, cruelty and slander against others; he sins, and washes
        his hands. Without the True Guru, he has no understanding; he
        is lost in the utter darkness of anger and attachment.  || 2 ||
        He takes the intoxicating drugs of cruelty and corruption, and
        is plundered. He is not conscious of the Creator Lord God. The
        Lord of the Universe is hidden and unattached. The mortal is like
        a wild elephant, intoxicated with the wine of egotism.  || 3 ||
        In His Mercy, God saves His Saints; they have the Support of
        His Lotus Feet. With his palms pressed together, Nanak has come
        to the Sanctuary of the Primal Being, the Infinite Lord God.

        Why are you indulding in corrupt actions? Look at this, see and
        understand! Meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        and attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. Imbued with
        the Love of the Lord, you shall totally play with Him.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   The world is a dream. Its expanse is false. O my
        companion, why are you so enticed by the Enticer? Enshrine the
        Love of Your Beloved within your heart.  || 1 ||   He is total
        love and affection. God is always merciful. Others - why
        are you involved with others? Remain involved with the Lord.When
        you join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, says Nanak,
        meditate on the Lord. Now, your association with death is ended.
        || 2 || 1 || 130 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH MEHL:  You may make donations
        of gold, and give away land in charity and purify your mind in
        various ways, but none of this is equal to the Lord's Name.
        Remain attached to the Lord's Lotus Feet.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   You may recite the four Vedas with your tongue, and listen
        to the eighteen Puraanas and the six Shaastras with your ears,
        but these are not equal to the celestial melody of the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord of the Universe. Remain attached to the Lord's
        Lotus Feet.  || 1 ||   You may observe fasts, and say your prayers,
        purify yourself and do good deeds; you may go on pilgrimages everywhere
        and eat nothing at all. You may cook your food without touching
        anyone; you may make a great show of cleansing techniques, and
        burn incense and devotional lamps, but none of these are equal
        to the Lord's Name. O Merciful Lord, please hear the prayer
        of the meek and the poor. Please grant me the Blessed Vision of
        Your Darshan, that I may see You with my eyes. The Naam is so
        sweet to servant Nanak.  || 2 || 2 || 131 ||   SAARANG,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Meditate on the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. </font><br>
