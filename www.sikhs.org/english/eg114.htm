      <p> By great good fortune, I have found the Guru, the True Guru, and
        in the body-village, the Lord has revealed Himself.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   Each and every breath of the Lord's humble
        servant is pierced through with love of the Lord God. As the lotus
        is totally in love with the water and withers away without seeing
        the water, so am I in love with the Lord.  || 2 ||   The Lord's
        humble servant chants the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord;
        through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord reveals Himself.
        The filth of egotism which stained me for countless lifetimes
        has been washed away, by the Ambrosial Water of the Ocean of the
        Lord.  || 3 ||   Please, do not take my karma into account, O
        my Lord and Master; please save the honor of Your slave. O Lord,
        if it pleases You, hear my prayer; servant Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary.
        || 4 || 3 || 5 ||   BASANT HINDOL,  FOURTH MEHL:  Each and every
        moment, my mind roams and rambles, and runs all over the place.
        It does not stay in its own home, even for an instant. But when
        the bridle of the Shabad, the Word of God, is placed over its
        head, it returns to dwell in its own home.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord
        of the Universe, lead me to join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
        so that I may meditate on You, Lord. I am cured of the disease
        of egotism, and I have found peace; I have intuitively entered
        into the state of Samaadhi.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This house is
        loaded with countless gems, jewels, rubies and emeralds, but the
        wandering mind cannot find them. As the water-diviner finds the
        hidden water, and the well is then dug in an instant, so do we
        find the object of the Name through the True Guru.  || 2 ||  
        Those who do not find such a Holy True Guru - cursed, cursed
        are the lives of those people. The treasure of this human life
        is obtained when one's virtues bear fruit, but it is lost
        in exchange for a mere shell.  || 3 ||   O Lord God, please be
        merciful to me; be merciful, and lead me to meet the Guru. Servant
        Nanak has attained the state of Nirvaanaa; meeting with the Holy
        people, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 4 || 4
        || 6 ||   BASANT HINDOL,  FOURTH MEHL:  Coming and going, he suffers
        the pains of vice and corruption; the body of the self-willed
        manmukh is desolate and vacant. He does not dwell on the Lord's
        Name, even for an instant, and so the Messenger of Death seizes
        him by his hair.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord of the Universe, please
        rid me of the poison of egotism and attachment. The Sat Sangat,
        Guru's True Congregation is so dear to the Lord. So join
        the Sangat, and taste the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   Please be kind to me, and unite me with the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation of the Holy; I seek the Sanctuary of the
        Holy. I am a heavy stone, sinking down - please lift me
        up and pull me out! O God, Merciful to the meek, You are the Destroyer
        of sorrow.  || 2 ||   I enshrine the Praises of my Lord and Master
        within my heart; joining the Sat Sangat, my intellect is enlightened.
        I have fallen in love with the Lord's Name; I am a sacrifice
        to the Lord.  || 3 ||   O Lord God, please fulfill the desires
        of Your humble servant; please bless me with Your Name, O Lord.
        Servant Nanak's mind and body are filled with ecstasy;
        the Guru has blessed him with the Mantra of the Lord's
        Name.  || 4 || 5 || 7 || 12 || 18 || 7 || 37 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">I serve the Guru, and humbly bow to Him. Today
        is a day of celebration for me. My anxiety is dispelled, and I
        have met the Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||   Today, it is springtime
        in my household. I sing Your Glorious Praises, O Infinite Lord
        God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Today, I am celebrating the festival
        of Phalgun. Joining with God's companions, I have begun
        to play. I celebrate the festival of Holi by serving the Saints.
        I am imbued with the deep crimson color of the Lord's Divine
        Love.  || 2 ||   My mind and body have blossomed forth, in utter,
        incomparable beauty. They do not dry out in either sunshine or
        shade; they flourish in all seasons. It is always springtime,
        when I meet with the Divine Guru.  || 3 ||   The wish-fulfilling
        Elysian Tree has sprouted and grown. It bears flowers and fruits,
        jewels of all sorts. I am satisfied and fulfilled, singing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord. Servant Nanak meditates on the Lord,
        Har, Har, Har.  || 4 || 1 ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:  The shopkeeper
        deals in merchandise for profit. The gambler's consciousness
        is focused on gambling. The opium addict lives by consuming opium.
        In the same way, the humble servant of the Lord lives by meditating
        on the Lord.  || 1 ||   Everyone is absorbed in his own pleasures.
        He is attached to whatever God attaches him to.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   When the clouds and the rain come, the peacocks dance. Seeing
        the moon, the lotus blossoms. When the mother sees her infant,
        she is happy. In the same way, the humble servant of the Lord
        lives by meditating on the Lord of the Universe.  || 2 ||   The
        tiger always wants to eat meat. Gazing upon the battlefield, the
        warrior's mind is exalted. The miser is totally in love
        with his wealth. The humble servant of the Lord leans on the Support
        of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   All love is contained in the
        Love of the One Lord. All comforts are contained in the Comfort
        of the Lord's Name. He alone receives this treasure, O
        Nanak, unto whom the Guru gives His gift.  || 4 || 2 ||   BASANT,
        FIFTH MEHL:  He alone experiences this springtime of the soul,
        unto whom God grants His Grace. He alone experiences this springtime
        of the soul, unto whom the Guru is merciful. He alone is joyful,
        who works for the One Lord. He alone experiences this eternal
        springtime of the soul, within whose heart the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, abides.  || 1 ||   This spring comes only to those
        homes, in which the melody of the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises resounds.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O mortal, let your love
        for the Supreme Lord God blossom forth. Practice spiritual wisdom,
        and consult the humble servants of the Lord. He alone is an ascetic,
        who joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. He alone
        dwells in deep, continual meditation, who loves his Guru.  ||
        2 ||   He alone is fearless, who has the Fear of God. He alone
        is peaceful, whose doubts are dispelled. He alone is a hermit,
        who heart is steady and stable. He alone is steady and unmoving,
        who has found the true place.  || 3 ||   He seeks the One Lord,
        and loves the One Lord. He loves to gaze upon the Blessed Vision
        of the Lord's Darshan. He intuitively enjoys the Love of
        the Lord. <br>

      <p> Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to that humble being.  || 4 || 3 ||
        BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:  You gave us our soul, breath of life and
        body. I am a fool, but You have made me beautiful, enshrining
        Your Light within me. We are all beggars, O God; You are merciful
        to us. Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, we are uplifted
        and exalted.  || 1 ||   O my Beloved, only You have the potency
        to act, and cause all to be done.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Chanting
        the Naam, the mortal is saved. Chanting the Naam, sublime peace
        and poise are found. Chanting the Naam, honor and glory are received.
        Chanting the Naam, no obstacles shall block your way.  || 2 ||
        For this reason, you have been blessed with this body, so difficult
        to obtain. O my Dear God, please bless me to speak the Naam. This
        tranquil peace is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy. May I always chant and meditate within my heart on Your
        Name, O God.  || 3 ||   Other than You, there is no one at all.
        Everything is Your play; it all merges again into You. As it pleases
        Your Will, save me, Lord. O Nanak, peace is obtained by meeting
        with the Perfect Guru.  || 4 || 4 ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:  My
        Beloved God, my King is with me. Gazing upon Him, I live, O my
        mother. Remembering Him in meditation, there is no pain or suffering.
        Please, take pity on me, and lead me on to meet Him.  || 1 ||
        My Beloved is the Support of my breath of life and mind. This
        soul, breath of life, and wealth are all Yours, O Lord.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   He is sought by the angels, mortals and divine
        beings. The silent sages, the humble, and the religious teachers
        do not understand His mystery. His state and extent cannot be
        described. In each and every home of each and every heart, He
        is permeating and pervading.  || 2 ||   His devotees are totally
        in bliss. His devotees cannot be destroyed. His devotees are not
        afraid. His devotees are victorious forever.  || 3 ||   What Praises
        of Yours can I utter? God, the Giver of peace, is all-pervading,
        permeating everywhere. Nanak begs for this one gift. Be merciful,
        and bless me with Your Name.  || 4 || 5 ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:
        As the plant turns green upon receiving water, just so, in the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, egotism is eradicated.
        Just as the servant is encouraged by his ruler, we are saved by
        the Guru.  || 1 ||   You are the Great Giver, O Generous Lord
        God. Each and every instant, I humbly bow to You.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Whoever enters the Saadh Sangat - that humble being
        is imbued with the Love of the Supreme Lord God. He is liberated
        from bondage. His devotees worship Him in adoration; they are
        united in His Union.  || 2 ||   My eyes are content, gazing upon
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. My tongue sings the Infinite
        Praises of God. My thirst is quenched, by Guru's Grace.
        My mind is satisfied, with the sublime taste of the Lord's
        subtle essence.  || 3 ||   Your servant is committed to the service
        of Your Feet, O Primal Infinite Divine Being. Your Name is the
        Saving Grace of all. Nanak has received this teasure.  || 4 ||
        6 ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are the Great Giver; You continue
        to give. You permeate and pervade my soul, and my breath of life.
        You have given me all sorts of foods and dishes. I am unworthy;
        I know none of Your Virtues at all.  || 1 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> I do not understand anything of Your Worth. Save me, O my Merciful
        Lord God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have not practiced meditation,
        austerities or good actions. I do not know the way to meet You.
        Within my mind, I have placed my hopes in the One Lord alone.
        The Support of Your Name shall carry me across.  || 2 ||  You
        are the Expert, O God, in all powers. The fish cannot find the
        limits of the water. You are Inaccessible and Unfathomable, the
        Highest of the High. I am small, and You are so very Great.  ||
        3 ||   Those who meditate on You are wealthy. Those who attain
        You are rich. Those who serve You are peaceful. Nanak seeks the
        Sanctuary of the Saints.  || 4 || 7 ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Serve the One who created You. Worship the One who gave you life.
        Become His servant, and you shall never again be punished. Become
        His trustee, and you shall never again suffer sorrow.  || 1 ||
        That mortal who is blessed with such great good fortune, attains
        this state of Nirvaanaa.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Life is wasted
        uselessly in the service of duality. No efforts shall be rewarded,
        and no works brought to fruition. It is so painful to serve only
        mortal beings. Service to the Holy brings lasting peace and bliss.
        || 2 ||   If you long for eternal peace, O Siblings of Destiny,
        then join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; this is the
        Guru's advice. There, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is
        meditated on. In the Saadh Sangat, you shall be emancipated. 
        || 3 ||   Among all essences, this is the essence of spiritual
        wisdom. Among all meditations, meditation on the One Lord is the
        most sublime. The Kirtan of the Lord's Praises is the ultimate
        melody. Meeting with the Guru, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 4 || 8 ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:  Chanting His
        Name, one's mouth becomes pure. Meditating in remembrance
        on Him, one's reputation becomes stainless. Worshipping
        Him in adoration, one is not tortured by the Messenger of Death.
        Serving Him, everything is obtained.  || 1 ||   The Lord's
        Name - chant the Lord's Name. Abandon all the desires
        of your mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is the Support of the earth
        and the sky. His Light illuminates each and every heart. Meditating
        in remembrance on Him, even fallen sinners are sanctified; in
        the end, they will not weep and wail over and over again.  ||
        2 ||   Among all religions, this is the ultimate religion. Among
        all rituals and codes of conduct, this is above all. The angels,
        mortals and divine beings long for Him. To find Him, commit yourself
        to the service of the Society of the Saints.  || 3 ||   One whom
        the Primal Lord God blesses with His bounties, obtains the treasure
        of the Lord. His state and extent cannot be described. Servant
        Nanak meditates on the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4 || 9 ||   BASANT,
        FIFTH MEHL:  My mind and body are gripped by thirst and desire.
        The Merciful Guru has fulfilled my hopes. In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, the residues of my sins have been taken
        away. I chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; I am in love with
        the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   By Guru's Grace, this
        spring of the soul has come. I enshrine the Lord's Lotus
        Feet within my heart; I listen to the Lord's Praise, forever
        and ever.  || 1 ||  Pause  || <br>

      <p> Our All-powerful Lord and Master is the Doer of all, the Cause
        of all causes. I am an orphan - I seek Your Sanctuary,
        God. All beings and creatures take Your Support. Be merciful,
        God, and save me.  || 2 ||   God is the Destroyer of fear, the
        Remover of pain and suffering. The angelic beings and silent sages
        serve Him. The earth and the sky are in His Power. All beings
        eat what You give them.  || 3 ||   O Merciful God, O Searcher
        of hearts, please bless Your slave with Your Glance of Grace.
        Please be kind and bless me with this gift, that Nanak may live
        in Your Name.  || 4 || 10 ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:   Loving the
        Lord, one's sins are taken away. Meditating on the Lord,
        one does not suffer at all. Meditating on the Lord of the Universe,
        all darkness is dispelled. Meditating in remembrance on the Lord,
        the cycle of reincarnation comes to an end.  || 1 ||   The love
        of the Lord is springtime for me. I am always with the humble
        Saints.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Saints have shared the Teachings
        with me. Blessed is that country where the devotees of the Lord
        of the Universe dwell. But that place where the Lord's
        devotees are not, is wilderness. By Guru's Grace, realize
        the Lord in each and every heart.  || 2 ||   Sing the Kirtan of
        the Lord's Praises, and enjoy the nectar of His Love. O
        mortal, you must always restrain yourself from committing sins.
        Behold the Creator Lord God near at hand. Here and hereafter,
        God shall resolve your affairs.  || 3 ||   I focus my meditation
        on the Lord's Lotus Feet. Granting His Grace, God has blessed
        me with this Gift. I yearn for the dust of the feet of Your Saints.
        Nanak meditates on his Lord and Master, who is ever-present, near
        at hand.  || 4 || 11 ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:  The True Transcendent
        Lord is always new, forever fresh. By Guru's Grace, I continually
        chant His Name. God is my Protector, my Mother and Father. Meditating
        in remembrance on Him, I do not suffer in sorrow.  || 1 ||   I
        meditate on my Lord and Master, single-mindedly, with love. I
        seek the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru forever. My True Lord and
        Master hugs me close in His Embrace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God
        Himself protects His humble servants. The demons and wicked enemies
        have grown weary of struggling against Him. Without the True Guru,
        there is no place to go. Wandering through the lands and foreign
        countries, people only grow tired and suffer in pain.  || 2 ||
        The record of their past actions cannot be erased. They harvest
        and eat what they have planted. The Lord Himself is the Protector
        of His humble servants. No one can rival the humble servant of
        the Lord.  || 3 ||   By His own efforts, God protects His slave.
        God's Glory is perfect and unbroken. So sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord of the Universe with your tongue forever.
        Nanak lives by meditating on the Feet of the Lord.  || 4 || 12
        ||   BASANT,  FIFTH MEHL:  Dwelling at the Guru's Feet,

        Name.  || 2 ||   My Supreme Guru has created everything. I perform
        devotional worship service to You, and fall at Your Feet, O Lord.
        Imbued with Your Name, I long to be Yours. Those who do not let

        comes to pass.  || 5 ||   She wears beautiful clothes with all
        sorts of decorations. But the flowers turn to dust, and her beauty
        leads her into evil. Hope and desire have blocked the doorway.
        Without the Naam, one's hearth and home are deserted. 
        || 6 ||   O princess, my daughter, run away from this place! Chant
        the True Name, and embellish your days. Serve your Beloved Lord
        God, and lean on the Support of His Love. Through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad, abandon your thirst for corruption and

        Lord, it has no honor or credit. You Yourself are the Listener,
        Lord, and You Yourself are our Protector. You are the Support
        of the earth; You Yourself behold and understand it.  || 4 ||
        When You Yourself make me wander, unto whom can I complain?
        Meeting the Guru, I will tell Him of my pain, O my mother. Abandoning
        my worthless demerits, now I practice virtue. Imbued with the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, I am absorbed in the True Lord.
        || 5 ||   Meeting with the True Guru, the intellect is elevated
        and exalted. The mind becomes immaculate, and egotism is washed
        away. He is liberated forever, and no one can put him in bondage.
        He chants the Naam forever, and nothing else.  || 6 ||   The mind
        comes and goes according to the Will of the Lord. The One Lord
        is contained amongst all; nothing else can be said. The Hukam
        of His Command pervades everywhere, and all merge in His Command.
        Pain and pleasure all come by His Will.  || 7 ||   You are infallible;
        You never make mistakes. Those who listen to the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad - their intellects become deep and profound. You,
        O my Great Lord and Master, are contained in the Shabad. O Nanak,
        my mind is pleased, praising the True Lord.  || 8 || 2 ||   BASANT,
        FIRST MEHL:  That person, who thirsts for the Blessed Vision
        of the Lord's Darshan, is absorbed in the One Lord, leaving
        duality behind. His pains are taken away, as he churns and drinks
        in the Ambrosial Nectar. The Gurmukh understands, and merges in
        the One Lord.  || 1 ||   So many cry out for Your Darshan, Lord.
        How rare are those who realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad
        and merge with Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Vedas say that we
        should chant the Name of the One Lord. He is endless; who can
        find His limits? There is only One Creator, who created the world.
        Without any pillars, He supports the earth and the sky.  || 2
        ||   Spiritual wisdom and meditation are contained in the melody
        of the Bani, the Word of the One Lord. The One Lord is Untouched
        and Unstained; His story is unspoken. The Shabad, the Word, is
        the Insignia of the One True Lord. Through the Perfect Guru, the
        Knowing Lord is known.  || 3 ||   There is only one religion of
        Dharma; let everyone grasp this truth. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, one becomes perfect, all the ages through. Imbued with
        the Unmanifest Celestial Lord, and lovingly absorbed in the One,
        the Gurmukh attains the invisible and infinite.  || 4 ||   There
        is one celestial throne, and One Supreme King. The Independent
        Lord God is pervading all places. The three worlds are the creation
        of that Sublime Lord. The One Creator of the Creation is Unfathomable
        and Incomprehensible.  || 5 ||   His Form is One, and True is
        His Name. True justice is administered there. Those who practice
        Truth are honored and accepted. They are honored in the Court
        of the True Lord.  || 6 ||   Devotional worship of the One Lord
        is the expression of love for the One Lord. Without the Fear of
        God and devotional worship of Him, the mortal comes and goes in
        reincarnation. One who obtains this understanding from the Guru
        dwells like an honored guest in this world. <br>

      <p> That humble being who is imbued with the sublime essence of the
        Lord is certified and approved.  || 7 ||   I see Him here and
        there; I dwell on Him intuitively. I do not love any other than
        You, O Lord and Master. O Nanak, my ego has been burnt away by
        the Word of the Shabad. The True Guru has shown me the Blessed
        Vision of the True Lord.  || 8 || 3 ||   BASANT,  FIRST MEHL:
        The fickle consciousness cannot find the Lord's limits.
        It is caught in non-stop coming and going. I am suffering and
        dying, O my Creator. No one cares for me, except my Beloved. 
        || 1 ||   All are high and exalted; how can I call anyone low?
        Devotional worship of the Lord and the True Name has satisfied
        me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have taken all sorts of medicines;
        I am so tired of them. How can this disease be cured, without
        my Guru? Without devotional worship of the Lord, the pain is so
        great. My Lord and Master is the Giver of pain and pleasure. 
        || 2 ||   The disease is so deadly; how can I find the courage?
        He knows my disease, and only He can take away the pain. My mind
        and body are filled with faults and demerits. I searched and searched,
        and found the Guru, O my brother!  || 3 ||   The Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, and the Lord's Name are the cures. As You keep
        me, so do I remain. The world is sick; where should I look? The
        Lord is Pure and Immaculate; Immaculate is His Name.  || 4 ||
        The Guru sees and reveals the Lord's home, deep within
        the home of the self; He ushers the soul-bride into the Mansion
        of the Lord's Presence. When the mind remains in the mind,
        and the consciousness in the consciousness, such people of the
        Lord remain unattached.  || 5 ||   They remain free of any desire
        for happiness or sorrow; tasting the Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar,
        they abide in the Lord's Name. They recognize their own
        selves, and remain lovingly attuned to the Lord. They are victorious
        on the battlefield of life, following the Guru's Teachings,
        and their pains run away.  || 6 ||   The Guru has given me the
        True Ambrosial Nectar; I drink it in. Of course, I have died,
        and now I am alive to live. Please, protect me as Your Own, if
        it pleases You. One who is Yours, merges into You.  || 7 ||  
        Painful diseases afflict those who are sexually promiscuous. God
        appears permeating and pervading in each and every heart. One
        who remains unattached, through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad - O Nanak, his heart and consciousness dwell upon
        and savor the Lord.  || 8 || 4 ||   BASANT,  FIRST MEHL,  IK-TUKEE:
        Do not make such a show of rubbing ashes on your body. O naked
        Yogi, this is not the way of Yoga!  || 1 ||   You fool! How can
        you have forgotten the Lord's Name? At the very last moment,
        it and it alone shall be of any use to you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Consult the Guru, reflect and think it over. Wherever I look,
        I see the Lord of the World.  || 2 ||   What can I say? I am nothing.
        All my status and honor are in Your Name.  || 3 ||   Why do you
        take such pride in gazing upon your property and wealth? When
        you must leave, nothing shall go along with you.  || 4 ||   So
        subdue the five thieves, and hold your consciousness in its place.
        This is the basis of the way of Yoga.  || 5 ||   Your mind is
        tied with the rope of egotism. You do not even think of the Lord
        - you fool! He alone shall liberate you.  || 6 ||   If
        you forget the Lord, you will fall into the clutches of the Messenger
        of Death. At that very last moment, you fool, you shall be beaten.
