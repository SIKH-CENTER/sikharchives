      <p> Through the Name comes salvation and merit.  || 8 ||   The Ganges,
        the Jamunaa where Krishna played, Kaydar Naat'h, Benares,
        Kanchivaram, Puri, Dwaarkaa, Ganga Saagar where the Ganges empties
        into the ocean, Trivaynee where the three rivers come together,
        and the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, are all merged
        in the Lord's Being.  || 9 ||   He Himself is the Siddha,
        the seeker, in meditative contemplation. He Himself is the King
        and the Council. God Himself, the wise Judge, sits on the throne;
        He takes away doubt, duality and fear.  || 10 ||   He Himself
        is the Qazi; He Himself is the Mullah. He Himself is infallible;
        He never makes mistakes. He Himself is the Giver of Grace, compassion
        and honor; He is no one's enemy.  || 11 ||   Whoever He
        forgives, He blesses with glorious greatness. He is the Giver
        of all; He does not have even an iota of greed. The Immaculate
        Lord is all pervading, permeating everywhere, both hidden and
        manifest.  || 12 ||   How can I praise the inaccessible, infinite
        Lord? The True Creator Lord is the Enemy of ego. He unites those
        whom He blesses with His Grace; uniting them in His Union, they
        are united.  || 13 ||   Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva stand at His
        Door; they serve the unseen, infinite Lord. Millions of others
        can be seen crying at His door; I cannot even estimate their numbers.
        || 14 ||   True is the Kirtan of His Praise, and True is the
        Word of His Bani. I can see no other in the Vedas and the Puraanas.
        Truth is my capital; I sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.
        I have no other support at all.  || 15 ||   In each and every
        age, the True Lord is, and shall always be. Who has not died?
        Who shall not die? Nanak the lowly offers this prayer; see Him
        within your own self, and lovingly focus on the Lord.  || 16 ||
        2 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  In duality and evil-mindedness, the
        soul-bride is blind and deaf. She wears the dress of sexual desire
        and anger. Her Husband Lord is within the home of her own heart,
        but she does not know Him; without her Husband Lord, she cannot
        go to sleep.  || 1 ||   The great fire of desire blazes within
        her. The self-willed manmukh looks around in the four directions.
        Without serving the True Guru, how can she find peace? Glorious
        greatness rests in the hands of the True Lord.  || 2 ||   Eradicating
        sexual desire, anger and egotism, she destroys the five thieves
        through the Word of the Shabad. Taking up the sword of spiritual
        wisdom, she struggles with her mind, and hope and desire are smoothed
        over in her mind.  || 3 ||   From the union of the mother's
        egg and the father's sperm, the form of infinite beauty
        has been created. The blessings of light all come from You; You
        are the Creator Lord, pervading everywhere.  || 4 ||   You have
        created birth and death. Why should anyone fear, if they come
        to understand through the Guru? When You, O Merciful Lord, look
        with Your kindness, then pain and suffering leave the body.  ||
        5 ||   One who sits in the home of his own self, eats his own
        fears. He quiets and holds his wandering mind still. His heart-lotus
        blossoms forth in the overflowing green pool, and the Lord of
        his soul becomes his companion and helper.  || 6 ||   With their
        death already ordained, mortals come into this world. How can
        they remain here? They have to go to the world beyond. True is
        the Lord's Command; the true ones dwell in the eternal
        city. The True Lord blesses them with glorious greatness.  ||
        7 ||   He Himself created the whole world. <br>

      <p> The One who made it, assigns the tasks to it. I cannot see any
        other above the True Lord. The True Lord does the appraisal. 
        || 8 ||   In this green pasture, the mortal stays only a few days.
        He plays and frolics in utter darkness. The jugglers have staged
        their show, and left, like people mumbling in a dream.  || 9 ||
        They alone are blessed with glorious greatness at the Lord's
        throne, who enshrine the fearless Lord in their minds, and lovingly
        center themselves on Him. In the galaxies and solar systems, nether
        regions, celestial realms and the three worlds, the Lord is in
        the primal void of deep absorption.  || 10 ||   True is the village,
        and true is the throne, of those Gurmukhs who meet with the True
        Lord, and find peace. In Truth, seated upon the true throne, they
        are blessed with glorious greatness; their egotism is eradicated,
        along with the calculation of their account.  || 11 ||   Calculating
        its account, the soul becomes anxious. How can one find peace,
        through duality and the three gunas - the three qualities?
        The One Lord is immaculate and formless, the Great Giver; through
        the Perfect Guru, honor is obtained.  || 12 ||   In each and every
        age, very rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize the Lord. Their
        minds are imbued with the True, all-pervading Lord. Seeking His
        Shelter, they find peace, and their minds and bodies are not stained
        with filth.  || 13 ||   Their tongues are imbued with the True
        Lord, the source of nectar; abiding with the Lord God, they have
        no fear or doubt. Hearing the Word of the Guru's Bani,
        their ears are satisfied, and their light merges into the Light.
        || 14 ||   Carefully, carefully, I place my feet upon the ground.
        Wherever I go, I behold Your Sanctuary. Whether You grant me pain
        or pleasure, You are pleasing to my mind. I am in harmony with
        You.  || 15 ||   No one is anyone's companion or helper
        at the very last moment; as Gurmukh, I realize You and praise
        You. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, I am detached; in the home
        of my own self deep within, I am absorbed in the primal void of
        deep meditation.  || 16 || 3 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  From the
        very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You are infinite
        and incomparable. You are my primal, immaculate Lord and Master.
        I contemplate the Way of Yoga, the Way of Union with the True
        Lord. I am truly absorbed in the primal void of deep meditation.
        || 1 ||   For so many ages, there was only pitch darkness; the
        Creator Lord was absorbed in the primal void. There was the True
        Name, the glorious greatness of the Truth, and the glory of His
        true throne.  || 2 ||   In the Golden Age of Truth, Truth and
        contentment filled the bodies. Truth was pervasive, Truth, deep,
        profound and unfathomable. The True Lord appraises the mortals
        on the Touchstone of Truth, and issues His True Command.  || 3
        ||   The Perfect True Guru is true and contented. He alone is
        a spiritual hero, who believes in the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad. He alone obtains a true seat in the True Court of the
        Lord, who surrenders to the Command of the Commander.  || 4 ||
        In the Golden Age of Truth, everyone spoke the Truth. Truth
        was pervasive - the Lord was Truth. With Truth in their
        minds and mouths, mortals were rid of doubt and fear. Truth was
        the friend of the Gurmukhs.  || 5 ||   In the Silver Age of Traytaa
        Yoga, one power of Dharma was lost. Three feet remained; through
        duality, one was cut off. Those who were Gurmukh spoke the Truth,
        while the self-willed manmukhs wasted away in vain.  || 6 || 
        The manmukh never succeeds in the Court of the Lord. Without
        the Word of the Shabad, how can one be pleased within? In bondage
        they come, and in bondage they go; they understand and comprehend
        nothing.  || 7 ||   In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, compassion
        was cut in half. <br>
      </p>
      <p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Only a few, as Gurmukh, remembered the Lord. Dharmic faith, which
        upholds and supports the earth, had only two feet; Truth was revealed
        to the Gurmukhs.  || 8 ||   The kings acted righteously only out
        of self-interest. Tied to hopes of reward, they gave to charities.
        Without the Lord's Name, liberation did not come, although
        they grew weary of performing rituals. || 9 ||   Practicing religious
        rituals, they sought liberation, but the treasure of liberation
        comes only by praising the Shabad. Without the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, liberation is not obtained; practicing hypocrisy, they
        wander around confused.  || 10 ||   Love and attachment to Maya
        cannot be abandoned. They alone find release, who practice deeds
        of Truth. Day and night, the devotees remain imbued with contemplative
        meditation; they become just like their Lord and Master.  || 11
        ||   Some chant and practice intensive meditation, and take cleansing
        baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. They walk as You will them
        to walk. By stubborn rituals of self-suppression, the Lord is
        not pleased. No one has ever obtained honor, without the Lord,
        without the Guru.  || 12 ||   In the Iron Age, the Dark Age of
        Kali Yuga, only one power remains. Without the Perfect Guru, no
        one has even described it. The self-willed manmukhs have staged
        the show of falsehood. Without the True Guru, doubt does not depart.
        || 13 ||   The True Guru is the Creator Lord, independent and
        carefree. He does not fear death, and He is not dependent on mortal
        men. Whoever serves Him becomes immortal and imperishable, and
        will not be tortured by death.  || 14 ||   The Creator Lord has
        enshrined Himself within the Guru. The Gurmukh saves countless
        millions. The Life of the World is the Great Giver of all beings.
        The Fearless Lord has no filth at all.  || 15 ||   Everyone begs
        from the Guru, God's Treasurer. He Himself is the immaculate,
        unknowable, infinite Lord. Nanak speaks the Truth; he begs from
        God. Please bless me with the Truth, by Your Will.  || 16 || 4
        ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  The True Lord unites with those who are
        united with the Word of the Shabad. When it pleases Him, we intuitively
        merge with Him. The Light of the Transcendent Lord pervades the
        three worlds; there is no other at all, O Siblings of Destiny.
        || 1 ||   I am His servant; I serve Him. He is unknowable and
        mysterious; He is pleased by the Shabad. The Creator is the Benefactor
        of His devotees. He forgives them - such is His greatness.
        || 2 ||   The True Lord gives and gives; His blessings never
        run short. The false ones receive, and then deny having received.
        They do not understand their origins, they are not pleased with
        the Truth, and so they wander in duality and doubt.  || 3 || 
        The Gurmukhs remain awake and aware, day and night. Following
        the Guru's Teachings, they know the Love of the True Lord.
        The self-willed manmukhs remain asleep, and are plundered. The
        Gurmukhs remain safe and sound, O Siblings of Destiny.  || 4 ||
        The false come, and the false go; imbued with falsehood, they
        practice only falsehood. Those who are imbued with the Shabad
        are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord; the Gurmukhs focus
        their consciousness on Him.  || 5 ||   The false are cheated,
        and robbed by the robbers. The garden is laid waste, like the
        rough wilderness. Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, nothing
        tastes sweet; forgetting the Lord, they suffer in sorrow.  ||
        6 ||   Receiving the food of Truth, one is satisfied. True is
        the glorious greatness of the jewel of the Name. One who understands
        his own self, realizes the Lord. <br>

      </p>
      <p> His light merges into the Light.  || 7 ||   Wandering from the
        Name, he endures beatings. Even great cleverness does not dispel
        doubt. The unconscious fool does not remain conscious of the Lord;
        he putrifies and rots away to death, carrying his heavy load of
        sin.  || 8 ||   No one is free of conflict and strife. Show me
        anyone who is, and I will praise him. Dedicating mind and body
        to God, one meets the Lord, the Life of the World, and becomes
        just like Him.  || 9 ||   No one knows the state and extent of
        God. Whoever calls himself great, will be eaten by his greatness.
        There is no lack of gifts of our True Lord and Master. He created
        all.  || 10 ||   Great is the glorious greatness of the independent
        Lord. He Himself created, and gives sustanance to all. The Merciful
        Lord is not far away; the Great Giver spontaneously unites with
        Himself, by His Will.  || 11 ||   Some are sad, and some are afflicted
        with disease. Whatever God does, He does by Himself. Through loving
        devotion, and the Perfect Teachings of the Guru, the unstruck
        sound current of the Shabad is realized.  || 12 ||   Some wander
        and roam around, hungry and naked. Some act in stubbornness and
        die, but do not know the value of God. They do not know the difference
        between good and bad; this is understood only through the practice
        of the Word of the Shabad.  || 13 ||   Some bathe at sacred shrines
        and refuse to eat. Some torment their bodies in burning fire.
        Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not obtained; how
        can anyone cross over?  || 14 ||   Abandoning the Guru's
        Teachings, some wander in the wilderness. The self-willed manmukhs
        are destitute; they do not meditate on the Lord. They are ruined,
        destroyed and drowned from practicing falsehood; death is the
        enemy of the false.  || 15 ||   By the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command, they come, and by the Hukam of His Command, they go.
        One who realizes His Hukam, merges in the True Lord. O Nanak,
        he merges in the True Lord, and his mind is pleased with the Lord.
        The Gurmukhs do His work.  || 16 || 5 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:
        He Himself is the Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny. He
        evaluates those whom He Himself has created. He Himself is the
        True Guru, and He Himself is the servant; He Himself created the
        Universe.  || 1 ||   He is near at hand, not far away. The Gurmukhs
        understand Him; perfect are those humble beings. Associating with
        them night and day is profitable. This is the glorious greatness
        of associating with the Guru.  || 2 ||   Throughout the ages,
        Your Saints are holy and sublime, O God. They sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, savoring it with their tongues. They chant
        His Praises, and their pain and poverty are taken away; they are
        not afraid of anyone else.  || 3 ||   They remain awake and aware,
        and do not appear to sleep. They serve up Truth, and so save their
        companions and relatives. They are not stained with the filth
        of sinful residues; they are immaculate and pure, and remain absorbed
        in loving devotional worship.  || 4 ||   O humble servants of
        the Lord, understand the Word of the Guru's Bani. This
        youth, breath and body shall pass away. O mortal, you shall die
        today or tomorrow; chant, and meditate on the Lord within your
        heart.  || 5 ||   O mortal, abandon falsehood and your worthless
        ways. Death viciously kills the false beings. The faithless cynic
        is ruined through falsehood and his egotistical mind.<br>

      <p> On the path of duality, he rots away and decomposes.  || 6 ||
        Abandon slander and envy of others. Reading and studying, they
        burn, and do not find tranquility. Joining the Sat Sangat, the
        True Congregation, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The
        Lord, the Supreme Soul, shall be your helper and companion.  ||
        7 ||   Abandon sexual desire, anger and wickedness. Abandon your
        involvement in egotistical affairs and conflicts. If you seek
        the Sanctuary of the True Guru, then you shall be saved. In this
        way you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Siblings
        of Destiny.  || 8 ||   In the hereafter, you shall have to cross
        over the fiery river of poisonous flames. No one else will be
        there; your soul shall be all alone. The ocean of fire spits out
        waves of searing flames; the self-willed manmukhs fall into it,
        and are roasted there.  || 9 ||   Liberation comes from the Guru;
        He grants this blessing by the Pleasure of His Will. He alone
        knows the way, who obtains it. So ask one who has obtained it,
        O Siblings of Destiny. Serve the True Guru, and find peace.  ||
        10 ||   Without the Guru, he dies entangled in sin and corruption.
        The Messenger of Death smashes his head and humiliates him. The
        slanderous person is not freed of his bonds; he is drowned, slandering
        others.  || 11 ||   So speak the Truth, and realize the Lord deep
        within. He is not far away; look, and see Him. No obstacles shall
        block your way; become Gurmukh, and cross over to the other side.
        This is the way to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  ||
        12 ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the
        body. The Creator Lord is eternal and imperishable. The soul does
        not die, and it cannot be killed; God creates and watches over
        all. Through the Word of the Shabad, His Will is manifest.  ||
        13 ||   He is immaculate, and has no darkness. The True Lord Himself
        sits upon His throne. The faithless cynics are bound and gagged,
        and forced to wander in reincarnation. They die, and are reborn,
        and continue coming and going.  || 14 ||   The Guru's servants
        are the Beloveds of the True Guru. Contemplating the Shabad, they
        sit upon His throne. They realize the essence of reality, and
        know the state of their inner being. This is the true glorious
        greatness of those who join the Sat Sangat.  || 15 ||   He Himself
        saves His humble servant, and saves his ancestors as well. His
        companions are liberated; He carries them across. Nanak is the
        servant and slave of that Gurmukh who lovingly focuses his consciousness
        on the Lord.  || 16 || 6 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  For many ages,
        only darkness prevailed; the infinite, endless Lord was absorbed
        in the primal void. He sat alone and unaffected in absolute darkness;
        the world of conflict did not exist.  || 1 ||   Thirty-six ages
        passed like this. He causes all to happen by the Pleasure of His
        Will. No rival of His can be seen. He Himself is infinite and
        endless.  || 2 ||   God is hidden throughout the four ages -
        understand this well. He pervades each and every heart, and is
        contained within the belly. The One and Only Lord prevails throughout
        the ages. How rare are those who contemplate the Guru, and understand
        this.  || 3 ||   From the union of the sperm and the egg, the
        body was formed. From the union of air, water and fire, the soul
        is made. He Himself plays joyfully in the mansion of the body;
        all the rest is just attachment to Maya's expanse.  ||
        4 ||   Within the mother's womb, upside-down, the mortal
        meditated on God. The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows
        everything. <br>

      <p> With each and every breath, he contemplated the True Name, deep
        within himself, within the womb.  || 5 ||   He came into the world
        to obtain the four great blessings. He came to dwell in the home
        of the Shiva and Shakti, energy and matter. But he forgot the
        One Lord, and he has lost the game. The blind person forgets the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 6 ||   The child dies in his childish
        games. They cry and mourn, saying that he was such a playful child.
        The Lord who owns him has taken him back. Those who weep and mourn
        are mistaken.  || 7 ||   What can they do, if he dies in his youth?
        They cry out, &quot;His is mine, he is mine!&quot; They cry
        for the sake of Maya, and are ruined; their lives in this world
        are cursed.  || 8 ||   Their black hair eventually turns grey.
        Without the Name, they lose their wealth, and then leave. They
        are evil-minded and blind - they are totally ruined; they
        are plundered, and cry out in pain.  || 9 ||   One who understands
        himself, does not cry. When he meets the True Guru, then he understands.
        Without the Guru, the heavy, hard doors are not opened. Obtaining
        the Word of the Shabad, one is emancipated.  || 10 ||   The body
        grows old, and is beaten out of shape. But he does not meditate
        on the Lord, His only friend, even at the end. Forgetting the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, he departs with his face blackened.
        The false are humiliated in the Court of the Lord.  || 11 || 
        Forgetting the Naam, the false ones depart. Coming and going,
        dust falls on their heads. The soul-bride finds no home in her
        in-laws' home, the world hereafter; she suffers in agony
        in this world of her parents' home.  || 12 ||   She eats,
        dresses and plays joyfully, but without loving devotional worship
        of the Lord, she dies uselessly. One who does not distinguish
        between good and evil, is beaten by the Messenger of Death; how
        can anyone escape this?  || 13 ||   One who realizes what he has
        to possess, and what he has to abandon, associating with the Guru,
        comes to know the Word of the Shabad, within the home of his own
        self. Do not call anyone else bad; follow this way of life. Those
        who are true are judged to be genuine by the True Lord.  || 14
        ||   Without Truth, no one succeeds in the Court of the Lord.
        Through the True Shabad, one is robed in honor. He forgives those
        with whom He is pleased; they silence their egotism and pride.
        || 15 ||   One who realizes the Hukam of God's Command,
        by the Grace of the Guru, comes to know the lifestyle of the ages.
        O Nanak, chant the Naam, and cross over to the other side. The
        True Lord will carry you across.  || 16 || 1 || 7 ||   MARU, 
        FIRST MEHL:  I have no other friend like the Lord. He gave me
        body and mind, and infused consciousness into my being. He cherishes
        and cares for all beings; He is deep within, the wise, all-knowing
        Lord.  || 1 ||   The Guru is the sacred pool, and I am His beloved
        swan. In the ocean, there are so many jewels and rubies. The Lord's
        Praises are pearls, gems and diamonds. Singing His Praises, my
        mind and body are drenched with His Love.  || 2 ||   The Lord
        is inaccessible, inscrutable, unfathomable and unattached. The
        Lord's limits cannot be found; the Guru is the Lord of
        the World. Through the Teachings of the True Guru, the Lord carries
        us across to the other side. He unites in His Union those who
        are colored by His Love.  || 3 ||   Without the True Guru, how
        can anyone be liberated? He has been the Friend of the Lord, from
        the very beginning of time, and all throughout the ages. <br>

      <p> By His Grace, He grants liberation in His Court; He forgives them
        for their sins.  || 4 ||   The True Guru, the Giver, grants liberation;
        all diseases are eradicated, and one is blessed with the Ambrosial
        Nectar. Death, the tax collector, does not impose any tax on one
        whose inner fire has been put out, whose heart is cool and tranquil.
        || 5 ||   The body has developed a great love for the soul-swan.
        He is a Yogi, and she is a beautiful woman. Day and night, he
        enjoys her with delight, and then he arises and departs without
        consulting her.  || 6 ||   Creating the Universe, God remains
        diffused throughout it. In the wind, water and fire, He vibrates
        and resounds. The mind wavers, keeping company with evil passions;
        one obtains the rewards of his own actions.  || 7 ||   Forgetting
        the Naam, one suffers the misery of his evil ways. When the order
        to depart is issued, how can he remain here? He falls into the
        pit of hell, and suffers like a fish out of water.  || 8 ||  
        The faithless cynic has to endure 8.4 million hellish incarnations.
        As he acts, so does he suffer. Without the True Guru, there is
        no liberation. Bound and gagged by his own actions, he is helpless.
        || 9 ||   This path is very narrow, like the sharp edge of a
        sword. When his account is read, he shall be crushed like the
        sesame seed in the mill. Mother, father, spouse and child -
        none is anyone's friend in the end. Without the Lord's
        Love, no one is liberated.  || 10 ||   You may have many friends
        and companions in the world, but without the Guru, the Transcendent
        Lord Incarnate, there is no one at all. Service to the Guru is
        the way to liberation. Night and day, sing the Kirtan of the Lord's
        Praises.  || 11 ||   Abandon falsehood, and pursue the Truth,
        and you shall obtain the fruits of your desires. Very few are
        those who trade in the merchandise of Truth. Those who deal in
        it, obtain the true profit.  || 12 ||   Depart with the merchandise
        of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and you shall intuitively obtain
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, in the Mansion of His Presence.
        The Gurmukhs search for Him and find Him; they are the perfect
        humble beings. In this way, they see Him, who looks upon all alike.
        || 13 ||   God is endless; following the Guru's Teachings,
        some find Him. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they
        instruct their minds. Accept as True, Perfectly True, the Word
        of the True Guru's Bani. In this way, you shall merge in
        the Lord, the Supreme Soul.  || 14 ||   Naarad and Saraswati are
        Your servants. Your servants are the greatest of the great, throughout
        the three worlds. Your creative power permeates all; You are the
        Great Giver of all. You created the whole creation.  || 15 ||
        Some serve at Your Door, and their sufferings are dispelled.
        They are robed with honor in the Court of the Lord, and emancipated
        by the True Guru. The True Guru breaks the bonds of egotism, and
        restrains the fickle consciousness.  || 16 ||   Meet the True
        Guru, and search for the way, by which you may find God, and not
        have to answer for your account. Subdue your egotism, and serve
        the Guru; O servant Nanak, you shall be drenched with the Lord's
        Love.  || 17 || 2 || 8 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  My Lord is the
        Destroyer of demons. My Beloved Lord is pervading each and every
        heart. The unseen Lord is always with us, but He is not seen at
        all. The Gurmukh contemplates the record.  || 1 || <br>

      <p> The Holy Gurmukh seeks Your Sanctuary. God grants His Grace, and
        carries him across to the other side. The ocean is very deep,
        filled with fiery water; the Guru, the True Guru, carries us across
        to the other side.  || 2 ||   The blind, self-willed manmukh does
        not understand. He comes and goes in reincarnation, dying, and
        dying again. The primal inscription of destiny cannot be erased.
        The spiritually blind suffer terribly at Death's door.
        || 3 ||   Some come and go, and do not find a home in their own
        heart. Bound by their past actions, they commit sins. The blind
        ones have no understanding, no wisdom; they are trapped and ruined
        by greed and egotism.  || 4 ||   Without her Husband Lord, what
        good are the soul-bride's decorations? She has forgotten
        her Lord and Master, and is infatuated with another's husband.
        Just as no one knows who is the father of the prostitute's
        son, such are the worthless, useless deeds that are done.  ||
        5 ||   The ghost, in the body-cage, suffers all sorts of afflictions.
        Those who are blind to spiritual wisdom, putrefy in hell. The
        Righteous Judge of Dharma collects the balance due on the account,
        of those who forget the Name of the Lord.  || 6 ||   The scorching
        sun blazes with flames of poison. The self-willed manmukh is dishonored,
        a beast, a demon. Trapped by hope and desire, he practices falsehood,
        and is afflicted by the terrible disease of corruption.  || 7
        ||   He carries the heavy load of sins on his forehead and head.
        How can he cross the terrifying world-ocean? From the very beginning
        of time, and throughout the ages, the True Guru has been the boat;
        through the Lord's Name, He carries us across.  || 8 ||
        The love of one's children and spouse is so sweet in
        this world. The expansive expanse of the Universe is attachment
        to Maya. The True Guru snaps the noose of Death, for that Gurmukh
        who contemplates the essence of reality.  || 9 ||   Cheated by
        falsehood, the self-willed manmukh walks along many paths; he
        may be highly educated, but he burns in the fire. The Guru is
        the Great Giver of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. Chanting
        the Naam, sublime peace is obtained.  || 10 ||   The True Guru,
        in His Mercy, implants Truth within. All suffering is eradicated,
        and one is placed on the Path. Not even a thorn ever pierces the
        foot of one who has the True Guru as his Protector.  || 11 ||
        Dust mixes with dust, when the body wastes away. The self-willed
        manmukh is like a stone slab, which is impervious to water. He
        cries out and weeps and wails; he is reincarnated into heaven
        and then hell.  || 12 ||   They live with the poisonous snake
        of Maya. This duality has ruined so many homes. Without the True
        Guru, love does not well up. Imbued with devotional worship, the
        soul is satisfied.  || 13 ||   The faithless cynics chase after
        Maya. Forgetting the Naam, how can they find peace? In the three
        qualities, they are destroyed; they cannot cross over to the other
        side.  || 14 ||   The false are called pigs and dogs. They bark
        themselves to death; they bark and bark and howl in fear. False
        in mind and body, they practice falsehood; through their evil-mindedness,
        they lose out in the Court of the Lord.  || 15 ||   Meeting the
        True Guru, the mind is stabilized. One who seeks His Sanctuary
        is blessed with the Lord's Name. They are given the priceless
        wealth of the Lord's Name; singing His Praises, they are
        His beloveds in His court.  || 16 || <br>

      <p> In the Sanctuary of the Holy, chant the Lord's Name. Through
        the True Guru's Teachings, one comes to know His state
        and extent. Nanak: chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my
        mind; the Lord, the Uniter, shall unite you with Himself.  ||
        17 || 3 || 9 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  Remain in your own home,
        O my foolish and ignorant mind. Meditate on the Lord -
        concentrate deep within your being and meditate on Him. Renounce
        your greed, and merge with the infinite Lord. In this way, you
        shall find the door of liberation.  || 1 ||   If you forget Him,
        the Messenger of Death will catch sight of you. All peace will
        be gone, and you will suffer in pain in the world hereafter. Chant
        the Name of the Lord as Gurmukh, O my soul; this is the supreme
        essence of contemplation.  || 2 ||   Chant the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, the sweetest essence. As Gurmukh, see the essence of
        the Lord deep within. Day and night, remain imbued with the Lord's
        Love. This is the essence of all chanting, deep meditation and
        self-discipline.  || 3 ||   Speak the Guru's Word, and
        the Name of the Lord. In the Society of the Saints, search for
        this essence. Follow the Guru's Teachings - seek
        and find the home of your own self, and you shall never be consigned
        to the womb of reincarnation again.  || 4 ||   Bathe at the sacred
        shrine of Truth, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Reflect
        upon the essence of reality, and lovingly focus your consciousness
        on the Lord. At the very last moment, the Messenger of Death will
        not be able to touch you, if you chant the Name of the Beloved
        Lord.  || 5 ||   The True Guru, the Primal Being, the Great Giver,
        is all-knowing. Whoever has Truth within himself, merges in the
        Word of the Shabad. One whom the True Guru unites in Union, is
        rid of the overpowering fear of death.  || 6 ||   The body is
        formed from the union of the five elements. Know that the Lord's
        jewel is within it. The soul is the Lord, and the Lord is the
        soul; contemplating the Shabad, the Lord is found.  || 7 ||  
        Abide in truth and contentment, O humble Siblings of Destiny.
        Hold tight to compassion and the Sanctuary of the True Guru. Know
        your soul, and know the Supreme Soul; associating with the Guru,
        you shall be emancipated.  || 8 ||   The faithless cynics are
        stuck in falsehood and deceit. Day and night, they slander many
        others. Without meditative remembrance, they come and then go,
        and are cast into the hellish womb of reincarnation.  || 9 ||
        The faithless cynic is not rid of his fear of death. The Messenger
        of Death's club is never taken away. He has to answer to
        the Righteous Judge of Dharma for the account of his actions;
        the egotistical being carries the unbearable load.  || 10 || 
        Tell me: without the Guru, what faithless cynic has been saved?
        Acting egotistically, he falls into the terrifying world-ocean.
        Without the Guru, no one is saved; meditating on the Lord, they
        are carried across to the other side.  || 11 ||   No one can erase
        the Guru's blessings. The Lord carries across those whom
        He forgives. The pains of birth and death do not even approach
        those whose minds are filled with God, the infinite and endless.
        || 12 ||   Those who forget the Guru come and go in reincarnation.
        They are born, only to die again, and continue committing sins.
        The unconscious, foolish, faithless cynic does not remember the
        Lord; but when he is stricken with pain, then he cries out for
        the Lord.  || 13 ||   Pleasure and pain are the consequences of
        the actions of past lives. The Giver, who blesses us with these
        - He alone knows. So who can you blame, O mortal being? <br>

      <p> The hardships you suffer are from your own actions.  || 14 ||
        Practicing egotism and possessiveness, you have come into the
        world. Hope and desire bind you and lead you on. Indulging in
        egotism and self-conceit, what will you be able to carry with
        you, except the load of ashes from poison and corruption?  ||
        15 ||   Worship the Lord in devotion, O humble Siblings of Destiny.
        Speak the Unspoken Speech, and the mind will merge back into the
        Mind. Restrain your restless mind within its own home, and the
        Lord, the Destroyer, shall destroy your pain.  || 16 ||   I seek
        the support of the Perfect Guru, the Lord. The Gurmukh loves the
        Lord; the Gurmukh realizes the Lord. O Nanak, through the Lord's
        Name, the intellect is exalted; granting His forgiveness, the
        Lord carries him across to the other side.  || 17 || 4 || 10 ||
        MARU,  FIRST MEHL:  O Divine Guru, I have entered Your Sanctuary.
        You are the Almighty Lord, the Merciful Lord. No one knows Your
        wondrous plays; You are the perfect Architect of Destiny.  ||
        1 ||   From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages,
        You cherish and sustain Your beings. You are in each and every
        heart, O Merciful Lord of incomparable beauty. As You will, You
        cause all to walk; everyone acts according to Your Command.  ||
        2 ||   Deep within the nucleus of all, is the Light of the Life
        of the World. The Lord enjoys the hearts of all, and drinks in
        their essence. He Himself gives, and He himself takes; He is the
        generous father of the beings of the three worlds.  || 3 ||  
        Creating the world, He has set His play into motion. He placed
        the soul in the body of air, water and fire. The body-village
        has nine gates; the Tenth Gate remains hidden.  || 4 ||   There
        are four horrible rivers of fire. How rare is that Gurmukh who
        understands this, and through the Word of the Shabad, remains
        unattached. The faithless cynics are drowned and burnt through
        their evil-mindedness. The Guru saves those who are imbued with
        the Love of the Lord.  || 5 ||   Water, fire, air, earth and ether
        - in that house of the five elements, they dwell. Those
        who remain imbued with the Word of the True Guru's Shabad,
        renounce Maya, egotism and doubt.  || 6 ||   This mind is drenched
        with the Shabad, and satisfied. Without the Name, what support
        can anyone have? The temple of the body is being plundered by
        the thieves within, but this faithless cynic does not even recognize
        these demons.  || 7 ||   They are argumentative demons, terrifying
        goblins. These demons stir up conflict and strife. Without awareness
        of the Shabad, one comes and goes in reincarnation; he loses his
        honor in this coming and going.  || 8 ||   The body of the false
        person is just a pile of barren dirt. Without the Name, what honor
        can you have? Bound and gagged throughout the four ages, there
        is no liberation; the Messenger of Death keeps such a person under
        his gaze.  || 9 ||   At Death's door, he is tied up and
        punished; such a sinner does not obtain salvation. He cries out
        in pain, like the fish pierced by the hook.  || 10 ||   The faithless
        cynic is caught in the noose all alone. The miserable spiritually
        blind person is caught in the power of Death. Without the Lord's
        Name, liberation is not known. He shall waste away, today or tomorrow.
        || 11 ||   Other than the True Guru, no one is your friend. Here
        and hereafter, God is the Savior. He grants His Grace, and bestows
        the Lord's Name. <br>

      <p> He merges with Him, like water with water.  || 12 ||   The Guru
        instructs His wandering Sikhs; if they go astray, He sets them
        on the right path. So serve the Guru, forever, day and night;
        He is the Destroyer of pain - He is with you as your companion.
        || 13 ||   O mortal being, what devotional worship have you performed
        to the Guru? Even Brahma, Indra and Shiva do not know it. Tell
        me, how can the unknowable True Guru be known? He alone attains
        this realization, whom the Lord forgives.  || 14 ||   One who
        has love within, obtains the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. One
        who enshrines love for the Word of the Guru's Bani, meets
        with Him. Day and night, the Gurmukh sees the immaculate Divine
        Light everywhere; this lamp illuminates his heart.  || 15 || 
        The food of spiritual wisdom is the supremely sweet essence.
        Whoever tastes it, sees the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan. Beholding His Darshan, the unattached one meets the Lord;
        subduing the mind's desires, he merges into the Lord. 
        || 16 ||   Those who serve the True Guru are supreme and famous.
        Deep within each and every heart, they recognize God. Please bless
        Nanak with the Lord's Praises, and the Sangat, the Congregation
        of the Lord's humble servants; through the True Guru, they
        know their Lord God.  || 17 || 5 || 11 ||   MARU,  FIRST MEHL:
        The True Lord is the Creator of the Universe. He established
        and contemplates the worldly sphere. He Himself created the creation,
        and beholds it; He is True and independent.  || 1 ||   He created
        the beings of different kinds. The two travellers have set out
        in two directions. Without the Perfect Guru, no one is liberated.
        Chanting the True Name, one profits.  || 2 ||   The self-willed
        manmukhs read and study, but they do not know the way. They do
        not understand the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they wander, deluded
        by doubt. They take bribes, and give false testimony; the noose
        of evil-mindedness is around their necks.  || 3 ||   They read
        the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Puraanas; they argue and
        debate, but do not know the essence of reality. Without the Perfect
        Guru, the essence of reality is not obtained. The true and pure
        beings walk the Path of Truth.  || 4 ||   All praise God and listen,
        and listen and speak. He Himself is wise, and He Himself judges
        the Truth. Those whom God blesses with His Glance of Grace become
        Gurmukh, and praise the Word of the Shabad.  || 5 ||   Many listen
        and listen, and speak the Guru's Bani. Listening and speaking,
        no one knows His limits. He alone is wise, unto whom the unseen
        Lord reveals Himself; he speaks the Unspoken Speech.  || 6 ||
        At birth, the congratulations pour in; the ignorant sing songs
        of joy. Whoever is born, is sure to die, according to the destiny
        of past deeds inscribed upon his head by the Sovereign Lord King.
        || 7 ||   Union and separation were created by my God. Creating
        the Universe, He gave it pain and pleasure. The Gurmukhs remain
        unaffected by pain and pleasure; they wear the armor of humility.
        || 8 ||   The noble people are traders in Truth. They purchase
        the true merchandise, contemplating the Guru. One who has the
        wealth of the true commodity in his lap, is blessed with the rapture
        of the True Shabad.  || 9 ||   The false dealings lead only to
        loss. The trades of the Gurmukh are pleasing to God. His stock
        is safe, and his capital is safe and sound. </p>
