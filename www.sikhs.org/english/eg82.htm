      <p> Those who try, struggle and die in frustration.  || 2 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  He alone knows God, and he alone is a Brahmin, who
        walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. One whose heart
        is filled with the Lord, is freed of egotism and disease. He chants
        the Lord's Praises, gathers virtue, and his light merges
        into the Light. How rare are those Brahmins who, in this age,
        come to know God, by lovingly focusing their consciousness on
        Him. O Nanak, those who are blessed by the Lord's Glance
        of Grace, remain lovingly attuned to the Name of the True Lord.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  One who does not serve the True Guru,
        and who does not love the Word of the Shabad, earns the very painful
        disease of egotism; he is so very selfish. Acting stubborn-mindedly,
        he is reincarnated over and over again. The birth of the Gurmukh
        is fruitful and auspicious. The Lord unites him with Himself.
        O Nanak, when the Merciful Lord grants His Mercy, one obtains
        the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        All glorious greatness is in the Name of the Lord; as Gurmukh,
        meditate on the Lord. One obtains all that he asks for, if he
        keeps his consciousness focused on the Lord. If he tells the secrets
        of his soul to the True Guru, then he finds absolute peace. When
        the Perfect Guru bestows the Lord's Teachings, then all
        hunger departs. One who is blessed with such pre-ordained destiny,
        sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  No one goes away empty-handed from the True Guru; He unites
        me in Union with my God. Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of the
        Darshan of the True Guru; through it, one obtains whatever fruitful
        rewards he desires. The Word of the Guru's Shabad is Ambrosial
        Nectar. It banishes all hunger and thirst. Drinking in the sublime
        essence of the Lord brings contentment; the True Lord comes to
        dwell in the mind. Meditating on the True Lord, the status of
        immortality is obtained; the Unstruck Word of the Shabad vibrates
        and resounds. The True Lord is pervading in the ten directions;
        through the Guru, this is intuitively known. O Nanak, those humble
        beings who have the Truth deep within, are never hidden, even
        if others try to hide them.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Serving the
        Guru, one finds the Lord, when the Lord blesses him with His Glance
        of Grace. Human beings become angels, when the Lord blesses them
        with true devotional worship. Conquering egotism, they are blended
        with the Lord; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they
        are purified. O Nanak, they remain merged with the Lord; they
        are blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  Within the Guru, the True Guru, is the glorious greatness
        of the Name. The Creator Lord Himself has magnified it. All His
        servants and Sikhs live by gazing, gazing upon it. It is pleasing
        to their hearts deep within. The slanderers and evil-doers cannot
        see this glorious greatness; they do not appreciate the goodness
        of others. What can be achieved by anyone babbling? The Guru is
        in love with the True Lord. That which is pleasing to the Creator
        Lord, increases day by day, while all the people babble uselessly.
        || 4 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Cursed are the hopes in the love
        of duality; they tie the consciousness to love and attachment
        to Maya. <br>
      </p>
      <p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> One who forsakes the peace of the Lord in exchange for straw,
        and forgets the Naam, suffers in pain. The ignorant self-willed
        manmukhs are blind. They are born, only to die again, and continue
        coming and going. Their affairs are not resolved, and in the end,
        they depart, regretting and repenting. One who is blessed with
        the Lord's Grace, meets the True Guru; he alone meditates
        on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Imbued with the Naam, the humble
        servants of the Lord find a lasting peace; servant Nanak is a
        sacrifice to them.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Hope and desire entice
        the world; they entice the whole universe. Everyone, and all that
        has been created, is under the domination of Death. By the Hukam
        of the Lord's Command, Death seizes the mortal; he alone
        is saved, whom the Creator Lord forgives. O Nanak, by Guru's
        Grace, this mortal swims across, if he abandons his ego. Conquer
        hope and desire, and remain unattached; contemplate the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Wherever I go in
        this world, I see the Lord there. In the world hereafter as well,
        the Lord, the True Judge Himself, is pervading and permeating
        everywhere. The faces of the false are cursed, while the true
        devotees are blessed with glorious greatness. True is the Lord
        and Master, and true is His justice. The heads of the slanderers
        are covered with ashes. Servant Nanak worships the True Lord in
        adoration; as Gurmukh, he finds peace.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  By perfect destiny, one finds the True Guru, if the Lord
        God grants forgiveness. Of all efforts, the best effort is to
        attain the Lord's Name. It brings a cooling, soothing tranquility
        deep within the heart, and eternal peace. Then, one eats and wears
        the Ambrosial Nectar; O Nanak, through the Name, comes glorious
        greatness.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O mind, listening to the Guru's
        Teachings, you shall obtain the treasure of virtue. The Giver
        of peace shall dwell in your mind; you shall be rid of egotism
        and pride. O Nanak, by His Grace, one is blessed with the Ambrosial
        Nectar of the treasure of virtue.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The kings,
        emperors, rulers, lords, nobles and chiefs, are all created by
        the Lord. Whatever the Lord causes them to do, they do; they are
        all beggars, dependent on the Lord. Such is God, the Lord of all;
        He is on the True Guru's side. All castes and social classes,
        the four sources of creation, and the whole universe are slaves
        of the True Guru; God makes them work for Him. See the glorious
        greatness of serving the Lord, O Saints of the Lord; He has conquered
        and driven all the enemies and evil-doers out of the body-village.
        The Lord, Har, Har, is Merciful to His humble devotees; granting
        His Grace, the Lord Himself protects and preserves them.  || 6
        ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Fraud and hypocrisy within bring constant
        pain; the self-willed manmukh does not practice meditation. Suffering
        in pain, he does his deeds; he is immersed in pain, and he shall
        suffer in pain hereafter. By his karma, he meets the True Guru,
        and then, he is lovingly attuned to the True Name. O Nanak, he
        is naturally at peace; doubt and fear run away and leave him.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukh is in love with the Lord forever. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>
          <a name="p852" id="p852"><b>Page 852</b></a><br>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> The Name of the Lord is pleasing to his mind. The Gurmukh beholds
        and speaks the Naam, the Name of the Lord; chanting the Naam,
        he finds peace. O Nanak, the spiritual wisdom of the Gurmukh shines
        forth; the black darkness of ignorance is dispelled.  || 2 ||
        THIRD MEHL:  The filthy, foolish, self-willed manmukhs die.
        The Gurmukhs are immaculate and pure; they keep the Lord enshrined
        within their hearts. Prays Nanak, listen, O Siblings of Destiny!
        Serve the True Guru, and the filth of your ego shall be gone.
        Deep within, the pain of skepticism afflicts them; their heads
        are constantly assaulted by worldly entanglements. Asleep in the
        love of duality, they never wake up; they are attached to the
        love of Maya. They do not remember the Name, and they do not contemplate
        the Word of the Shabad; this is the view of the self-willed manmukhs.
        They do not love the Lord's Name, and they lose their life
        uselessly. O Nanak, the Messenger of Death attacks them, and humiliates
        them.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  He alone is a true king, whom the Lord
        blesses with true devotion. People pledge their allegiance to
        him; no other store stocks this merchandise, nor deals in this
        trade. That humble devotee who turns his face towards the Guru
        and becomes sunmukh, receives the Lord's wealth; the faithless
        baymukh, who turns his face away from the Guru, gathers only ashes.
        The Lord's devotees are dealers in the Name of the Lord.
        The Messenger of Death, the tax-collector, does not even approach
        them. Servant Nanak has loaded the wealth of the Name of the Lord,
        who is forever independent and care-free.  || 7 ||   SHALOK, 
        THIRD MEHL:  In this age, the devotee earns the wealth of the
        Lord; all the rest of the world wanders deluded in doubt. By Guru's
        Grace, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell in his mind;
        night and day, he meditates on the Naam. In the midst of corruption,
        he remains detached; through the Word of the Shabad, he burns
        away his ego. He crosses over, and saves his relatives as well;
        blessed is the mother who gave birth to him. Peace and poise fill
        his mind forever, and he embraces love for the True Lord. Brahma,
        Vishnu and Shiva wander in the three qualities, while their egotism
        and desire increase. The Pandits, the religious scholars and the
        silent sages read and debate in confusion; their consciousness
        is centered on the love of duality. The Yogis, wandering pilgrims
        and Sanyaasees are deluded; without the Guru, they do not find
        the essence of reality. The miserable self-willed manmukhs are
        forever deluded by doubt; they waste away their lives uselessly.
        O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam are balanced and poised;
        forgiving them, the Lord blends them with Himself.  || 1 ||  
        THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, praise Him, who has control over everything.
        Remember Him, O mortals - without Him, there is no other
        at all. He dwells deep within those who are Gurmukh; forever and
        ever, they are at peace.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who do not
        become Gurmukh and earn the wealth of the Lord's Name,
        are bankrupt in this age. They wander around begging all over
        the world, but no one even spits in their faces. They gossip about
        others, and lose their credit, and expose themselves as well.
        That wealth, for which they slander others, does not come into
        their hands, no matter where they go. <br>
      </p>

          <a name="p853" id="p853"><b>Page 853</b></a><br>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> Through loving service, the Gurmukhs receive the wealth of the
        Naam, but the unfortunate ones cannot receive it. This wealth
        is not found anywhere else, in this country or in any other. 
        || 8 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukh does not have an iota
        of skepticism or doubt; worries depart from within him. Whatever
        he does, he does with grace and poise. Nothing else can be said
        about him. O Nanak, the Lord Himself hears the speech of those
        whom He makes His own.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  He conquers death,
        and subdues the desires of his mind; the Immaculate Name abides
        deep within him. Night and day, he remains awake and aware; he
        never sleeps, and he intuitively drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.
        His speech is sweet, and his words are nectar; night and day,
        he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. He dwells in the home
        of his own self, and appears beautiful forever; meeting him, Nanak
        finds peace.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The wealth of the Lord is a jewel,
        a gem; the Guru has caused the Lord to grant that wealth of the
        Lord. If someone sees something, he may ask for it; or, someone
        may cause it to be given to him. But no one can take a share of
        this wealth of the Lord by force. He alone obtains a share of
        the wealth of the Lord, who is blessed by the Creator with faith
        and devotion to the True Guru, according to his pre-ordained destiny.
        No one is a share-holder in this wealth of the Lord, and no one
        owns any of it. It has no boundaries or borders to be disputed.
        If anyone speaks ill of the wealth of the Lord, his face will
        be blackened in the four directions. No one's power or
        slander can prevail against the gifts of the Lord; day by day
        they continually, continuously increase.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  The world is going up in flames - shower it with
        Your Mercy, and save it! Save it, and deliver it, by whatever
        method it takes. The True Guru has shown the way to peace, contemplating
        the True Word of the Shabad. Nanak knows no other than the Lord,
        the Forgiving Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Through egotism, fascination
        with Maya has trapped them in duality. It cannot be killed, it
        does not die, and it cannot be sold in a store. Through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, it is burnt away, and then it departs
        from within. The body and mind become pure, and the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind. O Nanak, the
        Shabad is the killer of Maya; the Gurmukh obtains it.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  The glorious greatness of the True Guru was bestowed
        by the True Guru; He understood this as the Insignia, the Mark
        of the Primal Lord's Will. He tested His sons, nephews,
        sons-in-law and relatives, and subdued the egotistical pride of
        them all. Wherever anyone looks, my True Guru is there; the Lord
        blessed Him with the whole world. One who meets with, and believes
        in the True Guru, is embellished here and hereafter. Whoever turns
        his back on the Guru and becomes baymukh, shall wander in cursed
        and evil places. <br>

      <p> My Lord and Master is on the side of servant Nanak. The All-powerful
        and All-knowing Lord God is my Best Friend. Seeing the food being
        distributed, everyone came and fell at the feet of the True Guru,
        who cleansed the minds of all of their egotistical pride.  ||
        10 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  One plants the seed, another harvests
        the crop, and still another beats the grain from the chaff. O
        Nanak, it is not known, who will ultimately eat the grain.  ||
        1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  He alone is carried across, within whose mind
        the Lord abides. O Nanak, that alone happens, which is pleasing
        to His Will.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Merciful Supreme Lord God
        has carried me across the world-ocean. The compassionate perfect
        Guru has eradicated my doubts and fears. Unsatisfied sexual desire
        and unresolved anger, the horrible demons, have been totally destroyed.
        I have enshrined the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam within my
        throat and heart. O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, my birth and death have been adorned and redeemed. 
        || 11 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who forget the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, are said to be false. The five thieves plunder
        their homes, and egotism breaks in. The faithless cynics are defrauded
        by their own evil-mindedness; they do not know the sublime essence
        of the Lord. Those who lose the Ambrosial Nectar through doubt,
        remain engrossed and entangled in corruption. They make friends
        with the wicked, and argue with the humble servants of the Lord.
        O Nanak, the faithless cynics are bound and gagged by the Messenger
        of Death, and suffer agony in hell. They act according to the
        karma of the actions they committed before; as the Lord keeps
        them, so do they live.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Those who serve
        the True Guru, are transformed from powerless into powerful. With
        every breath and morsel of food, the Lord abides in their minds
        forever, and the Messenger of Death cannot even see them. The
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, fills their hearts, and Maya is their
        servant. One who becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves,
        obtains the greatest treasure. O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice
        to that one, within whose mind and body God dwells. One who has
        such pre-ordained destiny, he alone is in love with the humble
        Saints.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Whatever the Perfect True Guru says,
        the Transcendent Lord hears. It pervades and permeates the whole
        world, and it is on the mouth of each and every being. So numerous
        are the great glories of the Lord, they cannot even be counted.
        Truth, poise and bliss rest in the True Guru; the Guru bestows
        the jewel of Truth. O Nanak, the Supreme Lord God embellishes
        the Saints, who become like the True Lord.  || 12 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  He does not understand himself; he believes the
        Lord God to be far away. He forgets to serve the Guru; how can
        his mind remain in the Lord's Presence? The self-willed
        manmukh wastes away his life in worthless greed and falsehood.
        O Nanak, the Lord forgives, and blends them with Himself; through
        the True Word of the Shabad, He is ever-present.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  True is the Praise of the Lord God; the Gurmukh chants
        the Name of the Lord of the Universe. Praising the Naam night
        and day, and meditating on the Lord, the mind becomes blissful.
        By great good fortune, I have found the Lord, the perfect embodiment
        of supreme bliss. Servant Nanak praises the Naam; his mind and
        body shall never again be shattered.  || 2 || <br>

      <p> PAUREE:  If someone slanders the True Guru, and then comes seeking
        the Guru's Protection, the True Guru forgives him for his
        past sins, and unites him with the Saints' Congregation.
        When the rain falls, the water in the streams, rivers and ponds
        flows into the Ganges; flowing into the Ganges, it is made sacred
        and pure. Such is the glorious greatness of the True Guru, who
        has no vengeance; meeting with Him, thirst and hunger are quenched,
        and instantly, one attains celestial peace. O Nanak, behold this
        wonder of the Lord, my True King! Everyone is pleased with one
        who obeys and believes in the True Guru.  || 13 || 1 ||  SUDH

      <p> <font color="#000000">This world is a drama; no one can remain here.
        Walk the straight path; otherwise, you will be pushed around.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The children, the young and the old, O Siblings
        of Destiny, will be taken away by the Messenger of Death. The
        Lord has made the poor man a mouse, and the cat of Death is eating
        him up.  || 1 ||   It gives no special consideration to either
        the rich or the poor. The king and his subjects are equally killed;
        such is the power of Death.  || 2 ||   Those who are pleasing
        to the Lord are the servants of the Lord; their story is unique
        and singular. They do not come and go, and they never die; they
        remain with the Supreme Lord God.  || 3 ||   Know this in your
        soul, that by renouncing your children, spouse, wealth and property
        - says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - you shall be united
        with the Lord of the Universe.  || 4 || 1 ||   BILAAVAL:  I do
        not read books of knowledge, and I do not understand the debates.
        I have gone insane, chanting and hearing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O my father, I have gone insane; the whole
        world is sane, and I am insane. I am spoiled; let no one else
        be spoiled like me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have not made myself
        go insane - the Lord made me go insane. The True Guru has
        burnt away my doubt.  || 2 ||   I am spoiled; I have lost my intellect.
        Let no one go astray in doubt like me.  || 3 ||   He alone is
        insane, who does not understand himself. When he understands himself,
        then he knows the One Lord.  || 4 ||   One who is not intoxicated
        with the Lord now, shall never be intoxicated. Says Kabeer, I
        am imbued with the Lord's Love.  || 5 || 2 ||   BILAAVAL:
        Abandoning his household, he may go to the forest, and live by
        eating roots; but even so, his sinful, evil mind does not renounce
        corruption.  || 1 ||   How can anyone be saved? How can anyone
        cross over the terrifying world-ocean? Save me, save me, O my
        Lord! Your humble servant seeks Your Sanctuary.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I cannot escape my desire for sin and corruption. <br>

      </p>
      <p> I make all sorts of efforts to hold back from this desire, but
        it clings to me, again and again.  || 2 ||   Youth and old age
        - my entire life has passed, but I haven't done
        any good. This priceless soul has been treated as if if were worth
        no more than a shell.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, O my Lord, You are
        contained in all. There is none as merciful as You are, and none
        as sinful as I am.  || 4 || 3 ||   BILAAVAL:  Every day, he rises
        early, and brings a fresh clay pot; he passes his life embellishing
        and glazing it. He does not think at all of worldly weaving; he
        is absorbed in the subtle essence of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1
        ||   Who in our family has ever chanted the Name of the Lord?
        Ever since this worthless son of mine began chanting with his
        mala, we have had no peace at all!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Listen,
        O my sisters-in-law, a wondrous thing has happened! This boy has
        ruined our weaving business. Why didn't he simply die?
        || 2 ||   O mother, the One Lord, the Lord and Master, is the
        source of all peace. The Guru has blessed me with His Name. He
        preserved the honor of Prahlaad, and destroyed Harnaakhash with
        his nails.  || 3 ||   I have renounced the gods and ancestors
        of my house, for the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Says Kabeer,
        God is the Destroyer of all sins; He is the Saving Grace of His
        Saints.  || 4 || 4 ||   BILAAVAL:  There is no king equal to the
        Lord. All these lords of the world last for only a few days, putting
        on their false displays.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   How can Your humble
        servant waver? You spread Your shadow over the three worlds. Who
        can raise his hand against Your humble servant? No one can describe
        the Lord's expanse.  || 1 ||   Remember Him, O my thoughtless
        and foolish mind, and the unstruck melody of the sound current
        will resonate and resound. Says Kabeer, my skepticism and doubt
        have been dispelled; the Lord has exalted me, as He did Dhroo
        and Prahlaad.  || 2 || 5 ||   BILAAVAL:  Save me! I have disobeyed
        You. I have not practiced humility, righteousness or devotional
        worship; I am proud and egotistical, and I have taken a crooked
        path.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Believing this body to be immortal,
        I pampered it, but it is a fragile and perishable vessel. Forgetting
        the Lord who formed, fashioned and embellished me, I have become
        attached to another.  || 1 ||   I am Your thief; I cannot be called
        holy. I have fallen at Your feet, seeking Your Sanctuary. Says
        Kabeer, please listen to this prayer of mine, O Lord; please do
        not send me sommons of the Messenger of Death.  || 2 || 6 || 
        BILAAVAL:  I stand humbly at Your Court. Who else can take care
        of me, other than You? Please open Your door, and grant me the
        Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are
        the richest of the rich, generous and unattached. With my ears,
        I listen to Your Praises. From whom should I beg? I see that all
        are beggars. My salvation comes only from You.  || 1 ||   You
        blessed Jai Dayv, Naam Dayv and Sudaamaa the Brahmin with Your
        infinite mercy. Says Kabeer, You are the All-powerful Lord, the
        Great Giver; in an instant, You bestow the four great blessings.
        || 2 || 7 ||   BILAAVAL:  He has a walking stick, ear-rings,
        a patched coat and a begging bowl. <br>

      <p> Wearing the robes of a beggar, he wanders around, deluded by doubt.
        || 1 ||   Abandon your Yogic postures and breath control exercises,
        O madman. Renounce fraud and deception, and meditate continuously
        on the Lord, O madman.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That which you beg
        for, has been enjoyed in the three worlds. Says Kabeer, the Lord
        is the only Yogi in the world.  || 2 || 8 ||   BILAAVAL:  This
        Maya has made me forget Your feet, O Lord of the World, Master
        of the Universe. Not even a bit of love wells up in Your humble
        servant; what can Your poor servant do?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        Cursed is the body, cursed is the wealth, and cursed is this Maya;
        cursed, cursed is the clever intellect and understanding. Restrain
        and hold back this Maya; overcome it, through the Word of the
        Guru's Teachings.  || 1 ||   What good is farming, and
        what good is trading? Worldly entanglements and pride are false.
        Says Kabeer, in the end, they are ruined; ultimately, Death will
        come for them.  || 2 || 9 ||   BILAAVAL:  Within the pool of the
        body, there is an incomparably beautiful lotus flower. Within
        it, is the Supreme Light, the Supreme Soul, who has no feature
        or form.  || 1 ||   O my mind, vibrate, meditate on the Lord,
        and forsake your doubt. The Lord is the Life of the World.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Nothing is seen coming into the world, and nothing
        is seen leaving it. Where the body is born, there it dies, like
        the leaves of the water-lily.  || 2 ||   Maya is false and transitory;
        forsaking it, one obtains peaceful, celestial contemplation. Says
        Kabeer, serve Him within your mind; He is the Enemy of ego, the
        Destroyer of demons.  || 3 || 10 ||   BILAAVAL:  The illusion
        of birth and death is gone; I lovingly focus on the Lord of the
        Universe. In my life, I am absorbed in deep silent meditation;
        the Guru's Teachings have awakened me.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The sound made from bronze, that sound goes into the bronze
        again. But when the bronze is broken, O Pandit, O religious scholar,
        where does the sound go then?  || 1 ||   I gaze upon the world,
        the confluence of the three qualities; God is awake and aware
        in each and every heart. Such is the understanding revealed to
        me; within my heart, I have become a detached renunciate.  ||
        2 ||   I have come to know my own self, and my light has merged
        in the Light. Says Kabeer, now I know the Lord of the Universe,
        and my mind is satisfied.  || 3 || 11 ||   BILAAVAL:  When Your
        Lotus Feet dwell within one's heart, why should that person
        waver, O Divine Lord? I know that all comforts, and the nine treasures,
        come to one who intuitively, naturally, chants the Praise of the
        Divine Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   Such wisdom comes, only when one
        sees the Lord in all, and unties the knot of hypocrisy. Time and
        time again, he must hold himself back from Maya; let him take
        the scale of the Lord, and weigh his mind.  || 1 ||   Then wherever
        he goes, he will find peace, and Maya will not shake him. Says
        Kabeer, my mind believes in the Lord; I am absorbed in the Love
        of the Divine Lord.  || 2 || 12 || <br>

        powers in the palm of my hand; everything is by Your Grace.  ||
        1 ||   You know, and I am nothing, O Lord, Destroyer of fear.
        All beings seek Your Sanctuary, O God, Fulfiller, Resolver of
        our affairs.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whoever enters Your Sanctuary,
        is relieved of his burden of sin. You have saved the high and
        the low from the shameless world.  || 2 ||   Says Ravi Daas, what
        more can be said about the Unspoken Speech? Whatever You are,
        You are, O Lord; how can anything compare with Your Praises? 
        || 3 || 1 ||   BILAAVAL:  That family, into which a holy person
        is born, whether of high or low social class, whether rich or
        poor, shall have its pure fragrance spread all over the world.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whether he is a Brahmin, a Vaishya, a Soodra,
        or a Kh'shaatriya; whether he is a poet, an outcaste, or
        a filthy-minded person, he becomes pure, by meditating on the
        Lord God. He saves himself, and the families of both his parents.
        || 1 ||   Blessed is that village, and blessed is the place of
        his birth; blessed is his pure family, throughout all the worlds.
        One who drinks in the sublime essence abandons other tastes; intoxicated
        with this divine essence, he discards sin and corruption.  ||
        2 ||   Among the religious scholars, warriors and kings, there
        is no other equal to the Lord's devotee. As the leaves
        of the water lily float free in the water, says Ravi Daas, so
        is their life in the world.  || 3 || 2 || <br>

        What is Your value, O Guru of the world, if You will not erase
        the karma of my past actions? Why seek safety from a lion, if
        one is to be eaten by a jackal?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   For the
        sake of a single rain-drop, the sparrow-hawk suffers in pain.
        When its breath of life is gone, even an ocean is of no use to
