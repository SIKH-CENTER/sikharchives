      <p> The Sovereign Lord of the Universe is the Saving Grace, the Protector
        of the capital of His devotees.  || 1 ||   There is never any
        deficiency at all; the Lord's treasures are over-flowing.
        His Lotus Feet are enshrined within my mind and body; God is inaccessible
        and infinite.  || 2 ||   All those who work for Him dwell in peace;
        you can see that they lack nothing. By the Grace of the Saints,
        I have met God, the Perfect Lord of the Universe.  || 3 ||   Everyone
        congratulates me, and celebrates my victory; the home of the True
        Lord is so beautiful! Nanak chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        the treasure of peace; I have found the Perfect Guru.  || 4 ||
        33 || 63 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Worship and adore the Lord,
        Har, Har, Har, and you shall be free of disease. This is the Lord's
        healing rod, which eradicates all disease.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Meditating on the Lord, through the Perfect Guru, he constantly
        enjoys pleasure. I am devoted to the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy; I have been united with my Lord.  || 1 ||   Contemplating
        Him, peace is obtained, and separation is ended. Nanak seeks the
        Sanctuary of God, the All-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes.

        taken the medicine of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Fevers,
        sins and all diseases are eradicated, and my mind is cooled and
        soothed.  || 1 ||   Worshipping the Perfect Guru in adoration,
        all pains are dispelled. The Savior Lord has saved me; He has
        blessed me with His Kind Mercy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Grabbing
        hold of my arm, God has pulled me up and out; He has made me His
        own. Meditating, meditating in remembrance, my mind and body are
        at peace; Nanak has become fearless.  || 2 || 1 || 65 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Placing His Hand upon my forehead, God has given
        me the gift of His Name. One who performs fruitful service for
        the Supreme Lord God, never suffers any loss.  || 1 ||   God Himself
        saves the honor of His devotees. Whatever God's Holy servants
        wish for, He grants to them.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God's
        humble servants seek the Sanctuary of His Lotus Feet; they are
        God's very breath of life. O Nanak, they automatically,
        intuitively meet God; their light merges into the Light.  || 2
        || 2 || 66 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  God Himself has given
        me the Support of His Lotus Feet. God's humble servants
        seek His Sanctuary; they are respected and famous forever.  ||
        1 ||   God is the unparalleled Savior and Protector; service to
        Him is immaculate and pure. The Divine Guru has built the City
        of Ramdaspur, the royal domain of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Forever and ever, meditate on the Lord, and no obstacles will
        obstruct you. O Nanak, praising the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        the fear of enemies runs away.  || 2 || 3 || 67 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Worship and adore God in your mind and body; join
        the Company of the Holy. Chanting the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord of the Universe, the Messenger of Death runs far away.  ||

      <p> That humble being who chants the Lord's Name, remains always
        awake and aware, night and day. He is not affected by charms and
        spells, nor is he harmed by the evil eye.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Sexual desire, anger, the intoxication of egotism and emotional
        attachment are dispelled, by loving devotion. One who enters the
        Lord's Sanctuary, O Nanak, remains merged in ecstasy in
        the subtle essence of the Lord's Love.  || 2 || 4 || 68
        ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The living creatures and their ways
        are in God's power. Whatever He says, they do. When the
        Sovereign Lord of the Universe is pleased, there is nothing at
        all to fear.  || 1 ||   Pain shall never afflict you, if you remember
        the Supreme Lord God. The Messenger of Death does not even approach
        the beloved Sikhs of the Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The All-powerful
        Lord is the Cause of causes; there is no other than Him. Nanak
        has entered the Sanctuary of God; the True Lord has given strength
        to the mind.  || 2 || 5 || 69 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Remembering,
        remembering my God in meditation, the house of pain is removed.
        Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have found
        peace and tranquility; I shall not wander away from there again.
        || 1 ||   I am devoted to my Guru; I am a sacrifice to His Feet.
        I am blessed with ecstasy, peace and happiness, gazing upon the
        Guru, and singing the Lord's Glorious Praises.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   This is my life's purpose, to sing the Kirtan
        of the Lord's Praises, and listen to the vibrations of
        the sound current of the Naad. O Nanak, God is totally pleased
        with me; I have obtained the fruits of my desires.  || 2 || 6
        || 70 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  This is the prayer of Your
        slave: please elighten my heart. By Your Mercy, O Supreme Lord
        God, please erase my sins.  || 1 ||   I take the Support of Your
        Lotus Feet, O God, Primal Lord, treasure of virtue. I shall meditate
        in remembrance on the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        as long as there is breath in my body.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You
        are my mother, father and relative; You are abiding within all.
        Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God; His Praise is immaculate and
        pure.  || 2 || 7 || 71 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  All perfect
        spiritual powers are obtained, when one sings the Lord's
        Praises; everyone wishes him well. Everyone calls him holy and
        spiritual; hearing of him, the Lord's slaves come to meet
        him.  || 1 ||   The Perfect Guru blesses him with peace, poise,
        salvation and happiness. All living beings become compassionate
        to him; he remembers the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   He is permeating and pervading everywhere; God is
        the ocean of virtue. O Nanak, the devotees are in bliss, gazing
        upon God's abiding stability.  || 2 || 8 || 72 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  God, the Great Giver, has become merciful; He has
        listened to my prayer. He has saved His servant, and put ashes
        into the mouth of the slanderer.  || 1 ||   No one can threaten
        you now, O my humble friend, for you are the slave of the Guru.
        The Supreme Lord God reached out with His Hand and saved you.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One Lord is the Giver of all beings;
        there is no other at all. Nanak prays, You are my only strength,
        God.  || 2 || 9 || 73 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord of
        the Universe has saved my friends and companions. The slanderers
        have died, so do not worry.  || 1 ||  Pause  || <br>

      <p> God has fulfilled all hopes and desires; I have met the Divine
        Guru. God is celebrated and acclaimed all over the world; it is
        fruitful and rewarding to serve Him.  || 1 ||   Lofty, infinite
        and immeasurable is the Lord; all beings are in His Hands. Nanak

        Guru in adoration; He has become merciful to me. The Saint has
        shown me the Way, and the noose of Death has been cut away.  ||
        1 ||   Pain, hunger and scepticism have been dispelled, singing
        the Name of God. I am blessed with celestial peace, poise, bliss
        and pleasure, and all my affairs have been perfectly resolved.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The fire of desire has been quenched, and
        I am cooled and soothed; God Himself saved me. Nanak has entered
        the Sanctuary of God; His glorious radiance is so great!  || 2
        || 11 || 75 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The earth is beautified,
        all places are fruitful, and my affairs are perfectly resolved.
        Fear runs away, and doubt is dispelled, dwelling constantly upon
        the Lord.  || 1 ||   Dwelling with the humble Holy people, one
        finds peace, poise and tranquility, Blessed and auspicious is
        that time, when one meditates in remembrance on the Lord's
        Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   They have become famous throughout
        the world; before this, no one even knew their names. Nanak has
        come to the Sanctuary of the One who knows each and every heart.
        || 2 || 12 || 76 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  God Himself eradicated
        the disease; peace and tranquility have welled up. The Lord blessed
        me with the gifts of great, glorious radiance and wondrous form.
        || 1 ||   The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, has shown mercy
        to me, and saved my brother. I am under His Protection; He is
        always my help and support.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The prayer of
        the Lord's humble servant is never offered in vain. Nanak
        takes the strength of the Perfect Lord of the Universe, the treasure
        of excellence.  || 2 || 13 || 77 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        Those who forget the Giver of life, die, over and over again,
        only to be reborn and die. The humble servant of the Supreme Lord
        God serves Him; night and day, he remains imbued with His Love.
        || 1 ||   I have found peace, tranquility and great ecstasy;
        my hopes have been fulfilled. I have found peace in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy; I meditate in remembrance on
        the Lord, the treasure of virtue.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O my Lord
        and Master, please listen to the prayer of Your humble servant;
        You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. Nanak's
        Lord and Master is permeating and pervading all places and interspaces.
        || 2 || 14 || 78 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The hot wind does
        not even touch one who is under the Protection of the Supreme
        Lord God. On all four sides I am surrounded by the Lord's
        Circle of Protection; pain does not afflict me, O Siblings of
        Destiny.  || 1 ||   I have met the Perfect True Guru, who has
        done this deed. He has given me the medicine of the Lord's
        Name, and I enshrine love for the One Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The Savior Lord has saved me, and eradicated all my sickness.
        Says Nanak, God has showered me with His Mercy; He has become
        my help and support.  || 2 || 15 || 79 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:

      <p> <font color="#000000">O my fascinating Lord, let me not listen to

        his useless words.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I serve, serve, serve,
        serve the Holy Saints; forever and ever, I do this. The Primal
        Lord, the Great Giver, has blessed me with the gift of fearlessness.
        Joining the Company of the Holy, I sing the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||   My tongue is imbued with the Praises of the
        inaccessible and unfathomable Lord, and my eyes are drenched with
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Be Merciful to me, O Destroyer
        of the pains of the meek, that I may enshrine Your Lotus Feet
        within my heart.  || 2 ||   Beneath all, and above all; this is
        the vision I saw. I have destroyed, destroyed, destroyed my pride,

        Immeasurable, immeasurable, immeasurable is the Merciful Lord;
        he cannot be weighed. He is the Lover of His devotees. Whoever

        FIFTH MEHL:  O Dear God, You are the Support of my breath of
        life. I how in humility and reverence to You; so many times, I
        am a sacrifice.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Sitting down, standing up,
        sleeping and waking, this mind thinks of You. I describe to You
        my pleasure and pain, and the state of this mind.  || 1 ||   You
        are my shelter and support, power, intellect and wealth; You are
        my family. Whatever You do, I know that is good. Gazing upon Your
        Lotus Feet, Nanak is at peace.  || 2 || 2 || 82 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I have heard that God is the Savior of all. Intoxicated
        by attachment, in the company of sinners, the mortal has forgotten
        such a Lord from his mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He has collected
        poison, and grasped it firmly. But he has cast out the Ambrosial
        Nectar from his mind. He is imbued with sexual desire, anger,
        greed and slander; he has abandoned truth and contentment.  ||
        1 ||   Lift me up, and pull me out of these, O my Lord and Master.
        I have entered Your Sanctuary. Nanak prays to God: I am a poor
        beggar; carry me across, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy.  || 2 || 3 || 83 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  I listen to
        God's Teachings from the Saints. The Lord's Sermon,
        the Kirtan of His Praises and the songs of bliss perfectly resonate,
        day and night.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In His Mercy, God has made
        them His own, and blessed them with the gift of His Name. Twenty-four

        shall be quenched, and your soul shall be satisfied with the sweet,
        sublime essence of the Lord.  || 1 ||   I have grasped the Sanctuary
        of the Lord's Feet; He is the Giver of peace; through the
        Word of the Guru's Teachings, I meditate and chant the
        Chant of the Lord. I have crossed over the world-ocean, and my
        doubt and fear are dispelled, says Nanak, through the glorious
        granduer of our Lord and Master.  || 2 || 5 || 85 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Through the Guru, the Creator Lord has subdued the
        fever. I am a sacrifice to my True Guru, who has saved the honor
        of the whole world.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Placing His Hand on
        the child's forehead, He saved him. God blessed me with
        the supreme, sublime essence of the Ambrosial Naam.  || 1 ||

        - it is confirmed in the Court of the Lord.  || 2 || 6

      <p> <font color="#000000">The Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, is
        the light of the lamp. It dispels the darkness from the body-mansion,
        and opens the beautiful chamber of jewels.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        I was wonderstruck and astonished, when I looked inside; I cannot
        even describe its glory and grandeur. I am intoxicated and enraptured
        with it, and I am wrapped in it, through and through.  || 1 ||
        No worldly entanglements or snares can trap me, and no trace
        of egotistical pride remains. You are the highest of the high,
        and no curtain separates us; I am Yours, and You are mine.  ||
        2 ||   The One Creator Lord created the expanse of the one universe;
        the One Lord is unlimited and infinite. The One Lord pervades
        the one universe; the One Lord is totally permeating everywhere;
        the One Lord is the Support of the breath of life.  || 3 ||  
        He is the most immaculate of the immaculate, the purest of the
        pure, so pure, so pure. He has no end or limitation; He is forever
        unlimited. Says Nanak, He is the highest of the high.  || 4 ||
        1 || 87 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Without the Lord, nothing
        is of any use. You are totally attached to that Enticer Maya;
        she is enticing you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You shall have to leave
        behind your gold, your woman and your beautiful bed; you shall
        have to depart in an instant. You are entangled in the lures of
        sexual pleasures, and you are eating poisonous drugs.  || 1 ||
        You have built and adorned a palace of straw, and under it,
        you light a fire. Sitting all puffed-up in such a castle, you
        stubborn-minded fool, what do you think you will gain?  || 2 ||
        The five thieves stand over your head and seize you. <br>

      <p> Grabbing you by your hair, they will drive you on. You do not
        see them, you blind and ignorant fool; intoxicated with ego, you
        just keep sleeping.  || 3 ||   The net has been spread out, and
        the bait has been scattered; like a bird, you are being trapped.
        Says Nanak, my bonds have been broken; I meditate on the True
        Guru, the Primal Being.  || 4 || 2 || 88 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is infinite and priceless.
        It is the Beloved of my breath of life, and the Support of my
        mind; I remember it, as the betel leaf chewer remembers the betel
        leaf.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have been absorbed in celestial
        bliss, following the Guru's Teachings; my body-garment
        is imbued with the Lord's Love. I come face to face with
        my Beloved, by great good fortune; my Husband Lord never wavers.
        || 1 ||   I do not need any image, or incense, or perfume, or
        lamps; through and through, He is blossoming forth, with me, life
        and limb. Says Nanak, my Husband Lord has ravished and enjoyed
        His soul-bride; my bed has become very beautiful and sublime.
        || 2 || 3 || 89 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Chanting the Name
        of the Lord of the Universe, Gobind, Gobind, Gobind, we become
        like Him. Since I met the compassionate, Holy Saints, my evil-mindedness
        has been driven far away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Perfect Lord
        is perfectly pervading everywhere. He is cool and calm, peaceful
        and compassionate. Sexual desire, anger and egotistical desires
        have all been eliminated from my body.  || 1 ||   Truth, contentment,
        compassion, Dharmic faith and purity - I have received
        these from the Teachings of the Saints. Says Nanak, one who realizes
        this in his mind, achieves total understanding.  || 2 || 4 ||
        90 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  What am I? Just a poor living
        being. I cannot even describe one of Your hairs, O Lord. Even
        Brahma, Shiva, the Siddhas and the silent sages do not know Your
        State, O Infinite Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   What can I say?
        I cannot say anything. Wherever I look, I see the Lord pervading.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   And there, where the most terrible tortures
        are heard to be inflicted by the Messenger of Death, You are my
        only help and support, O my God. I have sought His Sanctuary,
        and grasped hold of the Lord's Lotus Feet; God has helped
        Guru Nanak to understand this understanding.  || 2 || 5 || 91
        ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  O Inaccessible, Beautiful, Imperishable
        Creator Lord, Purifier of sinners, let me meditate on You, even
        for an instant. O Wondrous Lord, I have heard that You are found
        by meeting the Saints, and focusing the mind on their feet, their
        holy feet.  || 1 ||   In what way, and by what discipline, is
        He obtained? Tell me, O good man, by what means can we meditate
        on Him?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If one human being serves another
        human being, the one served stands by him. Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary
        and Protection, O Lord, ocean of peace; He takes the Support of
        Your Name alone.  || 2 || 6 || 92 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:
        I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints, and I serve the Saints. I
        am rid of all worldly concerns, bonds, entanglements and other
        affairs.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have obtained peace, poise and
        great bliss from the Guru, through the Lord's Name. <br>

      <p> Such is the sublime essence of the Lord, that I cannot describe
        it. The Perfect Guru has turned me away from the world.  || 1
        ||   I behold the Fascinating Lord with everyone. No one is without
        Him - He is pervading everywhere. The Perfect Lord, the
        treasure of mercy, is permeating everywhere. Says Nanak, I am
        fully fulfilled.  || 2 || 7 || 93 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:
        What does the mind say? What can I say? You are wise and all-knowing,
        O God, my Lord and Master; what can I say to You?  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   You know even what is not said, whatever is in the soul.
        O mind, why do you deceive others? How long will you do this?
        The Lord is with you; He hears and sees everything.  || 1 || 
        Knowing this, my mind has become blissful; there is no other
        Creator. Says Nanak, the Guru has become kind to me; my love for
        the Lord shall never wear off.  || 2 || 8 || 94 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Thus, the slanderer crumbles away. This is the distinctive
        sign - listen, O Siblings of Destiny: he collapses like
        a wall of sand.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When the slanderer sees
        a fault in someone else, he is pleased. Seeing goodness, he is
        depressed. Twenty-four hours a day, he plots, but nothing works.
        The evil man dies, constantly thinking up evil plans.  || 1 ||
        The slanderer forgets God, death approaches him, and he starts
        to argue with the humble servant of the Lord. God Himself, the
        Lord and Master, is Nanak's protector. What can any wretched
        person do to him?  || 2 || 9 || 95 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Why do you wander in delusion like this? You act, and incite
        others to act, and then deny it. The Lord is always with you;
        He sees and hears everything.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You purchase
        glass, and discard gold; you are in love with your enemy, while
        you renounce your true friend. That which exists, seems bitter;
        that which does not exist, seems sweet to you. Engrossed in corruption,
        you are burning away.  || 1 ||   The mortal has fallen into the
        deep, dark pit, and is entangled in the darkness of doubt, and
        the bondage of emotional attachment. Says Nanak, when God becomes
        merciful, one meets with the Guru, who takes him by the arm, and
        lifts him out.  || 2 || 10 || 96 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        With my mind, body and tongue, I remember the Lord. I am in ecstasy,
        and my anxieties are dispelled; the Guru has blessed me with total
        peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My ignorance has been totally transformed
        into wisdom. My God is wise and all-knowing. Giving me His Hand,
        He saved me, and now no one can harm me at all.  || 1 ||   I am
        a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Holy; by their Grace,
        I contemplate the Lord's Name. Says Nanak, I place my faith
        in my Lord and Master; within my mind, I do not believe in any
        other, even for an instant.  || 2 || 11 || 97 ||   BILAAVAL, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Perfect Guru has has saved me. He has enshrined
        the Ambrosial Name of the Lord within my heart, and the filth
        of countless incarnations has been washed away.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The demons and wicked enemies are driven out, by meditating,
        and chanting the Chant of the Perfect Guru. <br>

      <p> What can any wretched creature do to me? The radiance of my God
        is gloriously great.  || 1 ||   Meditating, meditating, meditating
        in remembrance, I have found peace; I have enshrined His Lotus
        Feet within my mind. Slave Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; there
        is none above Him.  || 2 || 12 || 98 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Forever and ever, chant the Name of God. The pains of old age
        and death shall not afflict you, and in the Court of the Lord
        hereafter, your affairs shall be perfectly resolved.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   So forsake your self-conceit, and ever seek Sanctuary.
        This treasure is obtained only from the Guru. The noose of birth
        and death is snapped; this is the insignia, the hallmark, of the
        Court of the True Lord.  || 1 ||   Whatever You do, I accept as
        good. I have eradicated all egotistical pride from my mind. Says
        Nanak, I am under His protection; He created the entire Universe.
        || 2 || 13 || 99 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Deep within the
        nucleus of his mind and body, is God. He continually sings the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord, and always does good for others;
        his tongue is priceless.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All his generations
        are redeemed and saved in an instant, and the filth of countless
        incarnations is washed away. Meditating, meditating in remembrance
        on God, his Lord and Master, he passes blissfully through the
        forest of poison.  || 1 ||   I have obtained the boat of God's
        Feet, to carry me across the terrifying world-ocean. The Saints,
        servants and devotees belong to the Lord; Nanak's mind
        is attached to Him.  || 2 || 14 || 100 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:
        I am reassured, gazing upon Your wondrous play. You are my Lord
        and Master, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; You dwell
        with the Holy Saints.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In an instant, our
        Lord and Master establishes and exalts. From a lowly worm, He
        creates a king.  || 1 ||   May I never forget You from my heart;
        slave Nanak prays for this blessing.  || 2 || 15 || 101 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The imperishable Lord God is worthy of worship and
        adoration. Dedicating my mind and body, I place them before the
        Lord, the Cherisher of all beings.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   His Sanctuary
        is All-powerful; He cannot be described; He is the Giver of peace,
        the ocean of mercy, supremely compassionate. Holding him close
        in His embrace, the Lord protects and saves him, and then even
        the hot wind cannot touch him.  || 1 ||   Our Merciful Lord and
        Master is wealth, property and everything to His humble Saints.
        Nanak, a beggar, asks for the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan;
        please, bless him with the dust of the feet of the Saints.  ||
        2 || 16 || 102 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating on the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, is equal to millions of efforts. Joining
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord, and the Messenger of Death will be frightened away.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   To enshrine the Feet of God in one's
        mind and body, is to perform all sorts of acts of atonement. Coming
        and going, doubt and fear have run away, and the sins of countless
        incarnations are burnt away.  || 1 ||   So become fearless, and
        vibrate upon the Lord of the Universe. This is true wealth, obtained
        only by great good fortune. <br>

        chant Your immaculate Praises.  || 2 || 17 || 103 ||   BILAAVAL,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord saved me from Sulhi Khan. The emperor did
        not succeed in his plot, and he died in disgrace.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The Lord and Master raised His axe, and chopped off his
        head; in an instant, he was reduced to dust.  || 1 ||   Plotting
        and planning evil, he was destroyed. The One who created him,
        gave him a push. Of his sons, friends and wealth, nothing remains;
        he departed, leaving behind all his brothers and relatives. Says
        Nanak, I am a sacrifice to God, who fulfilled the word of His
        slave.  || 2 || 18 || 104 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Perfect
        is service to the Perfect Guru. Our Lord and Master Himself is
        Himself all-pervading. The Divine Guru has resolved all my affairs.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the beginning, in the middle and in the
        end, God is our only Lord and Master. He Himself fashioned His
        Creation. He Himself saves His servant. Great is the glorious
        grandeur of my God!  || 1 ||   The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent
        Lord is the True Guru; all beings are in His power. Nanak seeks
        the Sanctuary of His Lotus Feet, chanting the Lord's Name,
        the immaculate Mantra.  || 2 || 19 || 105 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  He Himself protects me from suffering and sin. Falling
        at the Guru's Feet, I am cooled and soothed; I meditate
        on the Lord's Name within my heart.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Granting His Mercy, God has extended His Hands. He is the Emancipator
        of the World; His glorious radiance pervades the nine continents.
        My pain has been dispelled, and peace and pleasure have come;
        my desire is quenched, and my mind and body are truly satisfied.
        || 1 ||   He is the Master of the masterless, All-powerful to
        give Sanctuary. He is the Mother and Father of the whole Universe.
        He is the Lover of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear; Nanak
        sings and chants the Glorious Praises of his Lord and Master.
        || 2 || 20 || 106 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Acknowledge the
        One, from whom You originated. Meditating on the Supreme Lord
        God, the Transcendent Lord, I have found peace, pleasure and salvation.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I met the Perfect Guru, by great good fortune,
        and so found the wise and all-knowing Lord, the Inner-knower,
        the Searcher of hearts. He gave me His Hand, and making me His
        own, He saved me; He is absolutely all-powerful, the honor of
        the dishonored.  || 1 ||   Doubt and fear have been dispelled
        in an instant, and in the darkness, the Divine Light shines forth.
        With each and every breath, Nanak worships and adores the Lord;
        forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him.  || 2 || 21 || 107
        ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Both here and hereafter, the Mighty
        Guru protects me. God has embellished this world and the next
        for me, and all my affairs are perfectly resolved.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have found peace
        and poise, bathing in the dust of the feet of the Holy. Comings
        and goings have ceased, and I have found stability; the pains
        of birth and death are eradicated.  || 1 ||   I cross over the
        ocean of doubt and fear, and the fear of death is gone; the One
        Lord is permeating and pervading in each and every heart. <br>

        of the Lord's Darshan, all pains run away. Please, never
        leave my vision, O Lord; please abide with my soul.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   My Beloved Lord and Master is the Support of the breath
        of life. God, the Inner-knower, is all-pervading.  || 1 ||   Which
        of Your Glorious Virtues should I contemplate and remember? With
        each and every breath, O God, I remember You.  || 2 ||   God is
        the ocean of mercy, merciful to the meek; He cherishes all beings
        and creatures.  || 3 ||   Twenty-four hours a day, Your humble
        servant chants Your Name. You Yourself, O God, have inspired Nanak
        to love You.  || 4 || 23 || 109 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Body,
        wealth and youth pass away. You have not meditated and vibrated
        upon the Lord's Name; while you commit your sins of corruption
        in the night, the light of day dawns upon you.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Continually eating all sorts of foods, the teeth in your
        mouth crumble, decay and fall out. Living in egotism and possessiveness,
        you are deluded; committing sins, you have no kindness for others.
        || 1 ||   The great sins are the terrible ocean of pain; the
        mortal is engrossed in them. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of his
        Lord and Master; taking him by the arm, God has lifted him up
        and out.  || 2 || 24 || 110 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  God Himself
        has come into my consciousness. My enemies and opponents have
        grown weary of attacking me, and now, I have become happy, O my
        friends and Siblings of Destiny.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The disease
        is gone, and all misfortunes have been averted; the Creator Lord
        has made me His own. I have found peace, tranquility and total
        bliss, enshrining the Name of my Beloved Lord within my heart.
        || 1 ||   My soul, body and wealth are all Your capital; O God,
        You are my All-powerful Lord and Master. You are the Saving Grace
        of Your slaves; slave Nanak is forever Your slave.  || 2 || 25
        || 111 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating in remembrance
        on the Lord of the Universe, I am emancipated. Suffering is eradicated,
        and true peace has come, meditating on the Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   All beings belong to Him -
        He makes them happy. He is the true power of His humble devotees.
        He Himself saves and protects His slaves, who believe in their
        Creator, the Destroyer of fear.  || 1 ||   I have found friendship,
        and hatred has been eradicated; the Lord has rooted out the enemies
        and villains. Nanak has been blessed with celestial peace and
        poise and total bliss; chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        he lives.  || 2 || 26 || 112 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  The
        Supreme Lord God has become Merciful. The True Guru has arranged
        all my affairs; chanting and meditating with the Holy Saints,
        I have become happy.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God has made me His
        own, and all my enemies have been reduced to dust. <br>

      <p> He hugs us close in His embrace, and protects His humble servants;
        attaching us to the hem of His robe, he saves us.  || 1 ||   Safe
        and sound, we have returned home, while the slanderer's
        face is blackened. Says Nanak, my True Guru is Perfect; by the
        Grace of God and Guru, I am so happy.  || 2 || 27 || 113 ||  
        BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have fallen in love with my Beloved
        Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   Cutting it, it does not break, and releasing
        it, it does not let go. Such is the string the Lord has tied me
        with.  || 1 ||   Day and night, He dwells within my mind; please
        bless me with Your Mercy, O my God.  || 2 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        a sacrifice to my beauteous Lord; I have heard his Unspoken Speech
        and Story.  || 3 ||   Servant Nanak is said to be the slave of
        His slaves; O my Lord and Master, please bless me with Your Mercy.
        || 4 || 28 || 114 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  I meditate on
        the Lord's Feet; I am a sacrifice to Them. My Guru is the
        Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord; I enshrine Him within
        my heart, and meditate on Him within my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Meditate, meditate, meditate in remembrance on the Giver
        of peace, who created the whole Universe. With your tongue, savor
        the One Lord, and you shall be honored in the Court of the True
        Lord.  || 1 ||   He alone obtains this treasure, who joins the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. O Lord and Master, mercifully
        bless Nanak with this gift, that he may ever sing the Glorious
        Praises of Your Kirtan.  || 2 || 29 || 115 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  I have been saved, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru. I
        am cheered and applauded throughout the world; my Supreme Lord
        God carries me across.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Perfect Lord
        fills the Universe; He is the Giver of peace; He cherishes and
        fulfills the whole Universe. He is completely filling all places
        and interspaces; I am a devoted sacrifice to the Lord's
        Feet.  || 1 ||   The ways of all beings are in Your Power, O my
        Lord and Master. All supernatural spiritual powers are Yours;
        You are the Creator, the Cause of causes. In the beginning, and
        throughout the ages, God is our Savior and Protector; remembering
        the Lord in meditation, O Nanak, fear is eliminated.  || 2 ||

        hereafter, You are the related Lord of form. You play it both
        ways, O my Lord and Master.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You exist within
        the city, and beyond it as well; O my God, You are everywhere.
        You Yourself are the King, and You Yourself are the subject. In
        one place, You are the Lord and Master, and in another place,
        You are the slave.  || 1 ||   From whom should I hide? Whom should
        I try to deceive? Wherever I look, I see Him near at hand. I have
        met with Guru Nanak, the Embodiment of the Holy Saints. When the

        as separate again.  || 2 || 1 || 117 ||   BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL: </font><br>
