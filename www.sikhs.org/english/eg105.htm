      <p> By Guru's Grace, those who drink in the sublime essence
        of the Lord are saved. He Himself is the Doer, and He Himself
        is the Cause; the Lord Himself is our Saving Grace.  || 3 || 
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who do not meet with the Guru, who
        have no Fear of God at all, continue coming and going in reincarnation,
        and suffer terrible pain; their anxiety is never relieved. They
        are beaten like clothes being washed on the rocks, and struck
        every hour like chimes. O Nanak, without the True Name, these
        entanglements are not removed from hanging over one's head.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  I have searched throughout the three worlds,
        O my friend; egotism is bad for the world. Don't worry,
        O my soul; speak the Truth, O Nanak, the Truth, and only the Truth.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Lord Himself forgives the Gurmukhs; they
        are absorbed and immersed in the Lord's Name. He Himself
        links them to devotional worship; they bear the Insignia of the
        Guru's Shabad. Those who turn towards the Guru, as sunmukh,
        are beautiful. They are famous in the Court of the True Lord.
        In this world, and in the world hereafter, they are liberated;
        they realize the Lord. Blessed, blessed are those humble beings
        who serve the Lord. I am a sacrifice to them.  || 4 ||   SHALOK,
        FIRST MEHL:  The rude, ill-mannered bride is encased in the body-tomb;
        she is blackened, and her mind is impure. She can enjoy her Husband
        Lord, only if she is virtuous. O Nanak, the soul-bride is unworthy,
        and without virtue.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  She has good conduct,
        true self-discipline, and a perfect family. O Nanak, day and night,
        she is always good; she loves her Beloved Husband Lord.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  One who realizes his own self, is blessed with the
        treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Granting His Mercy,
        the Guru merges him in the Word of His Shabad. The Word of the
        Guru's Bani is immaculate and pure; through it, one drinks
        in the sublime essence of the Lord. Those who taste the sublime
        essence of the Lord, forsake other flavors. Drinking in the sublime
        essence of the Lord, they remain satisfied forever; their hunger
        and thirst are quenched.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Her
        Husband Lord is pleased, and He enjoys His bride; the soul-bride
        adorns her heart with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak,
        that bride who stands before Him, is the most noble and respected
        woman.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  In her father-in-law's home
        hereafter, and in her parents' home in this world, she
        belongs to her Husband Lord. Her Husband is inaccessible and unfathomable.
        O Nanak, she is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to her carefree,
        independent Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  That king sits upon the
        throne, who is worthy of that throne. Those who realize the True
        Lord, they alone are the true kings. These mere earthly rulers
        are not called kings; in the love of duality, they suffer. Why
        should someone praise someone else who is also created? They depart
        in no time at all. The One True Lord is eternal and imperishable.
        One who, as Gurmukh, understands becomes eternal as well.  ||
        6 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The One Lord is the Husband of all.
        No one is without the Husband Lord. O Nanak, they are the pure
        soul-brides, who merge in the True Guru.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        The mind is churning with so many waves of desire. How can one
        be emancipated in the Court of the Lord? Be absorbed in the Lord's
        True Love, and imbued with the deep color of the Lord's
        Infinite Love. O Nanak, by Guru's Grace, one is emancipated,
        if the consciousness is attached to the True Lord.  || 2 ||  
        PAUREE:  The Name of the Lord is priceless. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <center>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> How can its value be estimated? He Himself created the entire
        universe, and He Himself is pervading it. The Gurmukhs praise
        the Lord forever, and through the Truth, they assess Him. Through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the heart-lotus blossoms
        forth, and in this way, one drinks in the sublime essence of the
        Lord. Coming and going in reincarnation ceases, and one sleeps
        in peace and poise.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Neither dirty,
        nor dull, nor saffron, nor any color that fades. O Nanak, crimson
        - deep crimson is the color of one who is imbued with the
        True Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The bumble bee intuitively
        and fearlessly dwells among the vegetation, flowers and fruits.
        O Nanak, there is only one tree, one flower, and one bumble bee.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those humble beings who struggle with their
        minds are brave and distinguished heroes. Those who realize their
        own selves, remain forever united with the Lord. This is the glory
        of the spiritual teachers, that they remain absorbed in their
        mind. They attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and
        focus their meditation on the True Lord. Those who conquer their
        own minds, by Guru's Grace, conquer the world.  || 8 ||
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  If I were to become a Yogi, and wander
        around the world, begging from door to door, then, when I am summoned
        to the Court of the Lord, what answer could I give? The Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, is the charity I beg for; contentment is
        my temple. The True Lord is always with me. Nothing is obtained
        by wearing religious robes; all will be seized by the Messenger
        of Death. O Nanak, talk is false; contemplate the True Name. 
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Through that door, you will be called to
        account; do not serve at that door. Seek and find such a True
        Guru, who has no equal in His greatness. In His Sanctuary, one
        is released, and no one calls him to account. Truth is implanted
        within Him, and He implants Truth within others. He bestows the
        blessing of the True Shabad. One who has Truth within his heart
        - his body and mind are also true. O Nanak, if one submits
        to the Hukam, the Command of the True Lord God, he is blessed
        with true glory and greatness. He is immersed and merged in the
        True Lord, who blesses him with His Glance of Grace.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  They are not called heroes, who die of egotism, suffering
        in pain. The blind ones do not realize their own selves; in the
        love of duality, they rot. They struggle with great anger; here
        and hereafter, they suffer in pain. The Dear Lord is not pleased
        by egotism; the Vedas proclaim this clearly. Those who die of
        egotism, shall not find salvation. They die, and are reborn in
        reincarnation.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The crow does
        not become white, and an iron boat does not float across. One
        who puts his faith in the treasure of his Beloved Lord is blessed;
        he exalts and embellishes others as well. One who realizes the
        Hukam of God's Command - his face is radiant and
        bright; he floats across, like iron upon wood. Forsake thirst
        and desire, and abide in the Fear of God; O Nanak, these are the
        most excellent actions.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The ignorant people
        who go to the desert to conquer their minds, are not able to conquer
        them. O Nanak, if this mind is to be conquered, one must contemplate
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. This mind is not conquered
        by conquering it, even though everyone longs to do so. O Nanak,
        the mind itself conquers the mind, if one meets with the True
        Guru. <br>

      </p>
      <p> || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He created both sides; Shiva dwells within
        Shakti (the soul dwells within the material universe). Through
        the material universe of Shakti, no one has ever found the Lord;
        they continue to be born and die in reincarnation. Serving the
        Guru, peace is found, meditating on the Lord with every breath
        and morsel of food. Searching and looking through the Simritees
        and the Shaastras, I have found that the most sublime person is
        the slave of the Lord. O Nanak, without the Naam, nothing is permanent
        and stable; I am a sacrifice to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 10 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  I might become a Pandit, a religious
        scholar, or an astrologer, and recite the four Vedas with my mouth;
        I might be worshipped throughout the nine regions of the earth
        for my wisdom and thought; let me not forget the Word of Truth,
        that no one can touch my sacred cooking square. Such cooking squares
        are false, O Nanak; only the One Lord is True.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  He Himself creates and He Himself acts; He bestows His
        Glance of Grace. He Himself grants glorious greatness; says Nanak,
        He is the True Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Only death is painful;
        I cannot conceive of anything else as painful. It is unstoppable;
        it stalks and pervades the world, and fights with the sinners.
        Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one is immersed
        in the Lord. Meditating on the Lord, one comes to realize the
        Lord. He alone is emancipated in the Sanctuary of the Lord, who
        struggles with his own mind. One who contemplates and meditates
        on the Lord in his mind, succeeds in the Court of the Lord.  ||
        11 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Submit to the Will of the Lord Commander;
        in His Court, only Truth is accepted. Your Lord and Master shall
        call you to account; do not go astray on beholding the world.
        One who keeps watch over his heart, and keeps his heart pure,
        is a dervish, a saintly devotee. Love and affection, O Nanak,
        are in the accounts placed before the Creator.  || 1 ||   FIRST
        MEHL:  One who is unattached like the bumble bee, sees the Lord
        of the world everywhere. The diamond of his mind is pierced through
        with the Diamond of the Lord's Name; O Nanak, his neck
        is embellished with it.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The self-willed manmukhs
        are afflicted by death; they cling to Maya in emotional attachment.
        In an instant, they are thrown to the ground and killed; in the
        love of duality, they are deluded. This opportunity shall not
        come into their hands again; they are beaten by the Messenger
        of Death with his stick. But Death's stick does not even
        strike those who remain awake and aware in the Love of the Lord.
        All are Yours, and cling to You; only You can save them.  || 12
        ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  See the imperishable Lord everywhere;
        attachment to wealth brings only great pain. Loaded with dust,
        you have to cross over the world-ocean; you are not carrying the
        profit and capital of the Name with you.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        My capital is Your True Name, O Lord; this wealth is inexhaustible
        and infinite. O Nanak, this merchandise is immaculate; blessed
        is the banker who trades in it.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Know and
        enjoy the primal, eternal Love of the Great Lord and Master. Blessed
        with the Naam, O Nanak, you shall strike down the Messenger of
        Death, and push his face to the ground.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  He
        Himself has embellished the body, and placed the nine treasures
        of the Naam within it. He confuses some in doubt; fruitless are
        their actions. Some, as Gurmukh, realize their Lord, the Supreme
        Soul. Some listen to the Lord, and obey Him; sublime and exalted
        are their actions. Love for the Lord wells up deep within, singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,
        FIRST MEHL: <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <br>
          <a name="p1091" id="p1091"><b>Page 1091</b></a><br>

      </p>
      <p> The Fear of God abides in the mind of the innocent; this is the
        straight path to the One Lord. Jealousy and envy bring terrible
        pain, and one is cursed throughout the three worlds.  || 1 ||
        FIRST MEHL:  The drum of the Vedas vibrates, bringing dispute
        and divisiveness. O Nanak, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the
        Lord; there is none except Him.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The world-ocean
        of the three qualities is unfathomably deep; how can its bottom
        be seen? If I meet with the great, self-sufficient True Guru,
        then I am carried across. This ocean is filled up with pain and
        suffering. O Nanak, without the True Name, no one's hunger
        is appeased.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  Those who search their inner
        beings, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, are exalted
        and adorned. They obtain what they wish for, meditating on the
        Lord's Name. One who is blessed by God's Grace,
        meets with the Guru; he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        The Righteous Judge of Dharma is his friend; he does not have
        to walk on the Path of Death. He meditates on the Lord's
        Name, day and night; he is absorbed and immersed in the Lord's
        Name.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Listen to and speak the
        Name of the One Lord, who permeates the heavens, this world and
        the nether regions of the underworld. The Hukam of His Command
        cannot be erased; whatever He has written, shall go with the mortal.
        Who has died, and who kills? Who comes and who goes? Who is enraptured,
        O Nanak, and whose consciousness merges in the Lord?  || 1 ||
        FIRST MEHL:  In egotism, he dies; possessiveness kills him,
        and the breath flows out like a river. Desire is exhausted, O
        Nanak, only when the mind is imbued with the Name. His eyes are
        imbued with the eyes of the Lord, and his ears ring with celestial
        consciousness. His tongue drinks in the sweet nectar, dyed crimson
        by chanting the Name of the Beloved Lord. His inner being is drenched
        with the Lord's fragrance; his worth cannot be described.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  In this age, the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is the treasure. Only the Naam goes along in the end. It is inexhaustible;
        it is never empty, no matter how much one may eat, consume or
        spend. The Messenger of Death does not even approach the humble
        servant of the Lord. They alone are the true bankers and traders,
        who have the wealth of the Lord in their laps. By the Lord's
        Mercy, one finds the Lord, only when the Lord Himself sends for
        him.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh
        does not appreciate the excellence of trading in Truth. He deals
        in poison, collects poison, and is in love with poison. Outwardly,
        they call themselves Pandits, religious scholars, but in their
        minds they are foolish and ignorant. They do not focus their consciousness
        on the Lord; they love to engage in arguments. They speak to cause
        arguments, and earn their living by telling lies. In this world,
        only the Lord's Name is immaculate and pure. All other
        objects of creation are polluted. O Nanak, those who do not remember
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are polluted; they die in ignorance.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Without serving the Lord, he suffers in
        pain; accepting the Hukam of God's Command, pain is gone.
        He Himself is the Giver of peace; He Himself awards punishment.
        O Nanak, know this well; all that happens is according to His
        Will.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Without the Lord's Name, the
        world is poor. Without the Name, no one is satisfied. He is deluded
        by duality and doubt. <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p> In egotism, he suffers in pain. Without good karma, he does not
        obtain anything, no matter how much he may wish for it. Coming
        and going in reincarnation, and birth and death are ended, through
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad. He Himself acts, so unto
        whom should we complain? There is no other at all.  || 16 || 
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  In this world, the Saints earn the wealth;
        they come to meet God through the True Guru. The True Guru implants
        the Truth within; the value of this wealth cannot be described.
        Obtaining this wealth, hunger is relieved, and peace comes to
        dwell in the mind. Only those who have such pre-ordained destiny,
        come to receive this. The world of the self-willed manmukh is
        poor, crying out for Maya. Night and day, it wanders continually,
        and its hunger is never relieved. It never finds calm tranquility,
        and peace never comes to dwell in its mind. It is always plagued
        by anxiety, and its cynicism never departs. O Nanak, without the
        True Guru, the intellect is perverted; if one meets the True Guru,
        then one practices the Word of the Shabad. Forever and ever, he
        dwells in peace, and merges in the True Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  The One who created the world, takes care of it. Meditate
        in remembrance on the One Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; there is
        none other than Him. So eat the food of the Shabad and goodness;
        eating it, you shall remain satisfied forever. Dress yourself
        in the Praise of the Lord. Forever and ever, it is radiant and
        bright; it is never polluted. I have intuitively earned the true
        wealth, which never decreases. The body is adorned with the Shabad,
        and is at peace forever and ever. O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes
        the Lord, who reveals Himself.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Deep within
        the self are meditation and austere self-discipline, when one
        realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Meditating on the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, egotism and ignorance are eliminated.
        One's inner being is overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar;
        tasting it, the flavor is known. Those who taste it become fearless;
        they are satisfied with the sublime essence of the Lord. Those
        who drink it in, by the Grace of the Lord, are never again afflicted
        by death.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  People tie up bundles
        of demerits; no one deals in virtue. Rare is that person, O Nanak,
        who purchases virtue. By Guru's Grace, one is blessed with
        virtue, when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||  
        THIRD MEHL:  Merits and demerits are the same; they are both created
        by the Creator. O Nanak, one who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's
        Command, finds peace, contemplating the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The King sits on the throne within
        the self; He Himself administers justice. Through the Word of
        the Guru's Shabad, the Lord's Court is known; within
        the self is the Sanctuary, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
        The coins are assayed, and the genuine coins are placed in His
        treasury, while the counterfeit ones find no place. The Truest
        of the True is all-pervading; His justice is forever True. One
        comes to enjoy the Ambrosial essence, when the Name is enshrined
        in the mind.  || 18 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  When one acts in
        egotism, then You are not there, Lord. <br>

      <p> Wherever You are, there is no ego. O spiritual teachers, understand
        this: the Unspoken Speech is in the mind. Without the Guru, the
        essence of reality is not found; the Invisible Lord dwells everywhere.
        One meets the True Guru, and then the Lord is known, when the
        Word of the Shabad comes to dwell in the mind. When self-conceit
        departs, doubt and fear also depart, and the pain of birth and
        death is removed. Following the Guru's Teachings, the Unseen
        Lord is seen; the intellect is exalted, and one is carried across.
        O Nanak, chant the chant of 'Sohang hansaa' -
        'He is me, and I am Him.' The three worlds are absorbed
        in Him.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Some assay their mind-jewel, and
        contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Only a few of
        those humble beings are known in this world, in this Dark Age
        of Kali Yuga. One's self remains blended with the Lord's
        Self, when egotism and duality are conquered. O Nanak, those who
        are imbued with the Naam cross over the difficult, treacherous
        and terrifying world-ocean.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The self-willed
        manmukhs do not search within their own selves; they are deluded
        by their egotistical pride. Wandering in the four directions,
        they grow weary, tormented by burning desire within. They do not
        study the Simritees and the Shaastras; the manmukhs waste away
        and are lost. Without the Guru, no one finds the Naam, the Name
        of the True Lord. One who contemplates the essence of spiritual
        wisdom and meditates on the Lord is saved.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,
        SECOND MEHL:  He Himself knows, He Himself acts, and He Himself
        does it right. So stand before Him, O Nanak, and offer your prayers.
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  He who created the creation, watches over
        it; He Himself knows. Unto whom should I speak, O Nanak, when
        everything is contained within the home of the heart?  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  Forget everything, and be friends with the One Lord
        alone. Your mind and body shall be enraptured, and the Lord shall
        burn away your sins. Your comings and goings in reincarnation
        shall cease; you shall not be reborn and die again. The True Name
        shall be your Support, and you shall not burn in sorrow and attachment.
        O Nanak, gather in the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        within your mind.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  You do not
        forget Maya from your mind; you beg for it with each and every
        breath. You do not even think of that God; O Nanak, it is not
        in your karma.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Maya and its wealth shall
        not go along with you, so why do you cling to it - are
        you blind? Meditate on the Guru's Feet, and the bonds of
        Maya shall be cut away from you.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  By the Pleasure
        of His Will, the Lord inspires us to obey the Hukam of His Command;
        by the Pleasure of His Will, we find peace. By the Pleasure of
        His Will, He leads us to meet the True Guru; by the Pleasure of
        His Will, we meditate on the Truth. There is no other gift as
        great as the Pleasure of His Will; this Truth is spoken and proclaimed.
        Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, practice and live the
        Truth. Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; He created the world.
        || 21 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Those who do not have spiritual
        wisdom within, do not have even an iota of the Fear of God. O
        Nanak, why kill those who are already dead? The Lord of the Universe
        Himself has killed them.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  To read the horoscope
        of the mind, is the most sublime joyful peace. He alone is called
        a good Brahmin, who understands God in contemplative meditation. <br>

      <p> He praises the Lord, and reads of the Lord, and contemplates the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad. Celebrated and approved is the
        coming into the world of such a person, who saves all his generations
        as well. Hereafter, no one is questioned about social status;
        excellent and sublime is the practice of the Word of the Shabad.
        Other study is false, and other actions are false; such people
        are in love with poison. They do not find any peace within themselves;
        the self-willed manmukhs waste away their lives. O Nanak, those
        who are attuned to the Naam are saved; they have infinite love
        for the Guru.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself creates the creation,
        and gazes upon it; He Himself is totally True. One who does not
        understand the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master, is false.
        By the Pleasure of His Will, the True Lord joins the Gurmukh to
        Himself. He is the One Lord and Master of all; through the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, we are blended with Him. The Gurmukhs
        praise Him forever; all are beggars of Him. O Nanak, as He Himself
        makes us dance, we dance.  || 22 || 1 ||  SUDH  || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">If You tell me to, O my Friend, I will cut
        off my head and give it to You. My eyes long for You; when will
        I see Your Vision?  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  I am in love with You;
        I have seen that other love is false. Even clothes and food are
        frightening to me, as long as I do not see my Beloved.  || 2 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  I rise early, O my Husband Lord, to behold Your
        Vision. Eye make-up, garlands of flowers, and the flavor of betel
        leaf, are all nothing but dust, without seeing You.  || 3 || 
        PAUREE:  You are True, O my True Lord and Master; You uphold
        all that is true. You created the world, making a place for the
        Gurmukhs. By the Will of the Lord, the Vedas came into being;
        they discriminate between sin and virtue. You created Brahma,
        Vishnu and Shiva, and the expanse of the three qualities. Creating
        the world of the nine regions, O Lord, You have embellished it
        with beauty. Creating the beings of various kinds, You infused
        Your power into them. No one knows Your limit, O True Creator
        Lord. You Yourself know all ways and means; You Yourself save
        the Gurmukhs.  || 1 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  If You are my
        friend, then don't separate Yourself from me, even for
        an instant. My soul is fascinated and enticed by You; when will
        I see You, O my Love?  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Burn in the fire,
        you evil person; O separation, be dead. O my Husband Lord, please
        sleep upon my bed, that all my sufferings may be gone.  || 2 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  The evil person is engrossed in the love of duality;
        through the disease of egotism, he suffers separation. The True
        Lord King is my friend; meeting with Him, I am so happy.  || 3
        ||   PAUREE:  You are inaccessible, merciful and infinite; who
        can estimate Your worth? You created the entire universe; You
        are the Master of all the worlds. No one knows Your creative power,
        O my all-pervading Lord and Master. No one can equal You; You
        are imperishable and eternal, the Savior of the world. <br>

      </p>
      <p> You established the four ages; You are the Creator of all worlds.
        You created the comings and goings of reincarnation; not even
        a particle of filth sticks to You. As you are merciful, You attach
        us to the Feet of the True Guru. You cannot be found by any other
        efforts; You are the eternal, imperishable Creator of the Universe.
        || 2 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  If You come into my courtyard,
        all the earth becomes beautiful. Other than the One Lord, my Husband,
        no one else cares for me.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  All my adornments
        become beautiful, when You, O Lord, sit in my courtyard and make
        it Yours. Then no traveller who comes to my home shall leave empty-handed.
        || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  I have spread out my bed for You, O my
        Husband Lord, and applied all my decorations. But even this is
        not pleasing to me, to wear a garland around my neck.  || 3 ||
        PAUREE:  O Supreme Lord God, O Transcendent Lord, You do not
        take birth. By the Hukam of Your Command, You formed the Universe;
        forming it, You merge into it. Your Form cannot be known; how
        can one meditate on You? You are pervading and permeating all;
        You Yourself reveal Your creative potency. Your treasures of devotional
        worship are overflowing; they never decrease. These gems, jewels
        and diamonds - their value cannot be estimated. As You
        Yourself become merciful, Lord, You link us to the service of
        the True Guru. One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
        never suffers any deficiency.  || 3 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:
        When I look within my being, I find that my Beloved is with me.
        All pains are relieved, O Nanak, when He bestows His Glance of
        Grace.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Nanak sits, waiting for news of
        the Lord, and stands at the Lord's Door; serving Him for
        so long. O my Beloved, only You know my objective; I stand, waiting
        to see the Lord's face.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  What should
        I say to you, you fool? Don't look at the vines of others
        - be a true husband. O Nanak, the entire world is blooming,
        like a garden of flowers.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  You are Wise, all-knowing
        and beautiful; You are pervading and permeating all. You Yourself
        are the Lord and Master, and the servant; You worship and adore
        Yourself. You are all-wise and all-seeing; You Yourself are true
        and pure. The Immaculate Lord, my Lord God, is celibate and True.
        God spreads out the expanse of the entire universe, and He Himself
        plays in it. He created this coming and going of reincarnation;
        creating the wondrous play, He gazes upon it. One who is blessed
        with the Guru's Teachings, is not consigned to the womb
        of reincarnation, ever again. All walk as He makes them walk;
        nothing is under the control of the created beings.  || 4 || 
        DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are walking along the river-bank,
        but the land is giving way beneath you. Watch out! Your foot might
        slip, and you'll fall in and die.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        You believe what is false and temporary to be true, and so you
        run on and on. O Nanak, like butter in the fire, it shall melt
        away; it shall fade away like the water-lily.  || 2 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  O my foolish and silly soul, why are you too lazy to serve?
        Such a long time has passed. <br>

      </p>
      <p> When will this opportunity come again?  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  You
        have no form or shape, no social class or race. These humans believe
        that You are far away; but You are quite obviously apparent. You
        enjoy Yourself in every heart, and no filth sticks to You. You
        are the blissful and infinite Primal Lord God; Your Light is all-pervading.
        Among all divine beings, You are the most divine, O Creator-architect,
        Rejuvenator of all. How can my single tongue worship and adore
        You? You are the eternal, imperishable, infinite Lord God. One
        whom You Yourself unite with the True Guru - all his generations
        are saved. All Your servants serve You; Nanak is a humble servant
        at Your Door.  || 5 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  He builds a hut
        of straw, and the fool lights a fire in it. Only those who have
        such pre-ordained destiny on their foreheads, find Shelter with
        the Master.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  O Nanak, he grinds the corn,
        cooks it and places it before himself. But without his True Guru,
        he sits and waits for his food to be blessed.  || 2 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  O Nanak, the loaves of bread are baked and placed on the
        plate. Those who obey their Guru, eat and are totally satisfied.
        || 3 ||   PAUREE:  You have staged this play in the world, and
        infused egotism into all beings. In the one temple of the body
        are the five thieves, who continually misbehave. The ten brides,
        the sensory organs were created, and the one husband, the self;
        the ten are engrossed in flavors and tastes. This Maya fascinates
        and entices them; they wander continually in doubt. You created
        both sides, spirit and matter, Shiva and Shakti. Matter loses
        out to spirit; this is pleasing to the Lord. You enshrined spirit
        within, which leads to merger with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
        Within the bubble, You formed the bubble, which shall once again
        merge into the water.  || 6 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  Look
        ahead; don't turn your face backwards. O Nanak, be successful
        this time, and you shall not be reincarnated again.  || 1 || 
        FIFTH MEHL:  My joyful friend is called the friend of all. All
        think of Him as their own; He never breaks anyone's heart.
        || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The hidden jewel has been found; it has
        appeared on my forehead. Beautiful and exalted is that place,
        O Nanak, where You dwell, O my Dear Lord.  || 3 ||   PAUREE: 
        When You are on my side, Lord, what do I need to worry about?
        You entrusted everything to me, when I became Your slave. My wealth
        is inexhaustible, no matter how much I spend and consume. The
        8.4 million species of beings all work to serve me. All these
        enemies have become my friends, and no one wishes me ill. No one
        calls me to account, since God is my forgiver. I have become blissful,
        and I have found peace, meeting with the Guru, the Lord of the
        Universe. All my affairs have been resolved, since You are pleased
        with me.  || 7 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  I am so eager to see
        You, O Lord; what does Your face look like? <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p> I wandered around in such a miserable state, but when I saw You,
        my mind was comforted and consoled.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The
        miserable endure so much suffering and pain; You alone know their
        pain, Lord. I may know hundreds of thousands of remedies, but
        I shall live only if I see my Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        I have seen the river-bank washed away by the raging waters of
        the river. They alone remain intact, who meet with the True Guru.
        || 3 ||   PAUREE:  No pain afflicts that humble being who hungers
        for You, Lord. That humble Gurmukh who understands, is celebrated
        in the four directions. Sins run away from that man, who seeks
        the Sanctuary of the Lord. The filth of countless incarnations
        is washed away, bathing in the dust of the Guru's feet.
        Whoever submits to the Lord's Will does not suffer in sorrow.
        O Dear Lord, You are the friend of all; all believe that You are
        theirs. The glory of the Lord's humble servant is as great
        as the Glorious Radiance of the Lord. Among all, His humble servant
        is pre-eminent; through His humble servant, the Lord is known.
        || 8 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those whom I followed, now
        follow me. Those in whom I placed my hopes, now place their hopes
        in me.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The fly flies around, and comes
        to the wet lump of molasses. Whoever sits on it, is caught; they
        alone are saved, who have good destiny on their foreheads.  ||
        2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  I see Him within all. No one is without Him.
        Good destiny is inscribed on the forehead of that companion, who
        who enjoys the Lord, my Friend.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  I am a minstrel
        at His Door, singing His Glorious Praises, to please to my Lord
        God. My God is permanent and stable; others continue coming and
        going. I beg for that gift from the Lord of the World, which will
        satisfy my hunger. O Dear Lord God, please bless Your minstrel
        with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, that I might be satisfied
        and fulfilled. God, the Great Giver, hears the prayer, and summons
        the minstrel to the Mansion of His Presence. Gazing upon God,
        the minstrel is rid of pain and hunger; he does not think to ask
        for anything else. All desires are fulfilled, touching the feet
        of God. I am His humble, unworthy minstrel; the Primal Lord God
        has forgiven me.  || 9 ||   DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  When the soul
        leaves, you shall become dust, O vacant body; why do you not realize
        your Husband Lord? You are in love with evil people; by what virtues
        will you enjoy the Lord's Love?  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        O Nanak, without Him, you cannot survive, even for an instant;
        you cannot afford to forget Him, even for a moment. Why are you
        alienated from Him, O my mind? He takes care of you.  || 2 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  Those who are imbued with the Love of the Supreme
        Lord God, their minds and bodies are colored deep crimson. O Nanak,
        without the Name, other thoughts are polluted and corrupt.  ||
        3 ||   PAUREE:  O Dear Lord, when You are my friend, what sorrow
        can afflict me? You have beaten off and destroyed the cheats that
        cheat the world. The Guru has carried me across the terrifying
        world-ocean, and I have won the battle. Through the Guru's
        Teachings, I enjoy all the pleasures in the great world-arena.
        The True Lord has brought all my senses and organs under my control. <br>

      <p> Wherever I join them, there they are joined; they do not struggle
        against me. I obtain the fruits of my desires; the Guru has directed
        me within. When Guru Nanak is pleased, O Siblings of Destiny,
        the Lord is seen to be dwelling near at hand.  || 10 ||   DAKHANAY,
        FIFTH MEHL:  When You come into my consciousness, then I obtain
        all peace and comfort. Nanak: with Your Name within my mind, O
        my Husband Lord, I am filled with delight.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        Enjoyment of clothes and corrupt pleasures - all these
        are nothing more than dust. I long for the dust of the feet of
        those who are imbued with the Lord's Vision.  || 2 || 
        FIFTH MEHL:  Why do you look in other directions? O my heart,
        take the Support of the Lord alone. Become the dust of the feet
        of the Saints, and find the Lord, the Giver of peace.  || 3 ||
        PAUREE:  Without good karma, the Dear Lord is not found; without
        the True Guru, the mind is not joined to Him. Only the Dharma
        remains stable in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; these sinners will
        not last at all. Whatever one does with this hand, he obtains
        with the other hand, without a moment's delay. I have examined
        the four ages, and without the Sangat, the Holy Congregation,
        egotism does not depart. Egotism is never eradicated without the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. As long as one's
        mind is torn away from his Lord and Master, he finds no place
        of rest. That humble being, who, as Gurmukh, serves the Lord,
        has the Support of the Imperishable Lord in the home of his heart.
        By the Lord's Grace, peace is obtained, and one is attached
        to the feet of the Guru, the True Guru.  || 11 ||   DAKHANAY,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I have searched everywhere for the King over the
        heads of kings. That Master is within my heart; I chant His Name
        with my mouth.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  O my mother, the Master
        has blessed me with the jewel. My heart is cooled and soothed,
        chanting the True Name with my mouth.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL: 
        I have become the bed for my Beloved Husband Lord; my eyes have
        become the sheets. If You look at me, even for an instant, then
        I obtain peace beyond all price.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  My mind longs
        to meet the Lord; how can I obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan?
        I obtain hundreds of thousands, if my Lord and Master speaks to
        me, even for an instant. I have searched in four directions; there
        is no other as great as You, Lord. Show me the Path, O Saints.
        How can I meet God? I dedicate my mind to Him, and renounce my
        ego. This is the Path which I shall take. Joining the Sat Sangat,
        the True Congregation, I serve my Lord and Master continually.
        All my hopes are fulfilled; the Guru has ushered me into the Mansion
        of the Lord's Presence. I cannot conceive of any other
        as great as You, O my Friend, O Lord of the World.  || 12 || 
        DAKHANAY,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have become the throne for my Beloved
        Lord King. If You place Your foot on me, I blossom forth like
        the lotus flower.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  If my Beloved becomes
        hungry, I will become food, and place myself before Him. I may
        be crushed, again and again, but like sugarcane, I do not stop
        yielding sweet juice.  || 2 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Break off your love
        with the cheaters; realize that it is a mirage. Your pleasure
        lasts for only two moments; this traveller wanders through countless
        homes.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  God is not found by intellectual devices;
        He is unknowable and unseen. </p>
