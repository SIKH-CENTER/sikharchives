      <p> The Lord God, Har, Har, has extended His Mercy.  || 1 ||   O Saints,
        there is peace everywhere. The Supreme Lord God, the Perfect Transcendent
        Lord, is pervading everywhere.  ||  Pause  ||   The Bani of His
        Word emanated from the Primal Lord. It eradicates all anxiety.
        The Lord is merciful, kind and compassionate. Nanak chants the
        Naam, the Name of the True Lord.  || 2 || 13 || 77 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Here and hereafter, He is our Savior. God, the True
        Guru, is Merciful to the meek. He Himself protects His slaves.
        In each and every heart, the Beautiful Word of His Shabad resounds.
        || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to the Guru's Feet. Day and night,
        with each and every breath, I remember Him; He is totally pervading
        and permeating all places.  ||  Pause  ||   He Himself has become
        my help and support. True is the support of the True Lord. Glorious
        and great is devotional worship to You. Nanak has found God's
        Sanctuary.  || 2 || 14 || 78 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        When it was pleasing to the Perfect True Guru, then I chanted
        the Naam, the Name of the Pervading Lord. The Lord of the Universe
        extended His Mercy to me, and God saved my honor.  || 1 ||   The
        Lord's feet are forever peace-giving. Whatever fruit one
        desires, he receives; his hopes shall not go in vain.  || 1 ||
        Pause  ||   That Saint, unto whom the Lord of Life, the Great
        Giver, extends His Mercy  -  he alone sings the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord. His soul is absorbed in loving devotional worship;
        his mind is pleasing to the Supreme Lord God.  || 2 ||   Twenty-four
        hours a day, he chants the Praises of the Lord, and the bitter
        poison does not affect him. My Creator Lord has united me with
        Himself, and the Holy Saints have become my companions.  || 3
        ||   Taking me by the hand, He has given me everything, and blended
        me with Himself. Says Nanak, everything has been perfectly resolved;
        I have found the Perfect True Guru.  || 4 || 15 || 79 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Humility is my spiked club. My dagger is to be the
        dust of all men's feet. No evil-doer can withstand these
        weapons. The Perfect Guru has given me this understanding.  ||
        1 ||   The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the support and shelter
        of the Saints. One who remembers the Lord in meditation, is emancipated;
        millions have been saved in this way.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In
        the Society of the Saints, I sing His Praises. I have found this,
        the perfect wealth of the Lord. Says Nanak, I have eradicated
        my self-conceit. I see the Supreme Lord God everywhere.  || 2
        || 16 || 80 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Perfect Guru
        has done it perfectly. He blessed me with forgiveness. I have
        found lasting peace and bliss. Everywhere, the people dwell in
        peace.  || 1 ||   Devotional worship to the Lord is what gives
        rewards. The Perfect Guru, by His Grace, gave it to me; how rare
        are those who know this.  ||  Pause  ||   Sing the Word of the
        Guru's Bani, O Siblings of Destiny. That is always rewarding
        and peace-giving. Nanak has meditated on the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord. He has realized his pre-ordained destiny.  || 2 || 17
        || 81 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL: </p>

      <p> I worship and adore the Perfect Guru. All my affairs have been
        resolved. All desires have been fulfilled. The unstruck melody
        of the sound current resounds.  || 1 ||   O Saints, meditating
        on the Lord, we obtain peace. In the home of the Saints, celestial
        peace is pervading; all pain and suffering is dispelled.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The Word of the Perfect Guru's Bani is pleasing
        to the Mind of the Supreme Lord God. Slave Nanak speaks the Unspoken,
        immaculate sermon of the Lord.  || 2 || 18 || 82 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The hungry man is not ashamed to eat. Just so, the
        humble servant of the Lord sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   Why are you so lazy in your own affairs? Remembering
        Him in meditation, your face shall be radiant in the Court of
        the Lord; you shall find peace, forever and ever.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Just as the lustful man is enticed by lust, so is the Lord's
        slave pleased with the Lord's Praise.  || 2 ||   Just as
        the mother holds her baby close, so does the spiritual person
        cherish the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||   This is obtained
        from the Perfect Guru. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord.  || 4 || 19 || 83 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Safe and sound, I have returned home. The slanderer's
        face is blackened with ashes. The Perfect Guru has dressed in
        robes of honor. All my pains and sufferings are over.  || 1 ||
        O Saints, this is the glorious greatness of the True Lord. He
        has created such wonder and glory!  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I speak
        according to the Will of my Lord and Master. God's slave
        chants the Word of His Bani. O Nanak, God is the Giver of peace.
        He has created the perfect creation.  || 2 || 20 || 84 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Within my heart, I meditate on God. I have returned
        home safe and sound. The world has become contented. The Perfect
        Guru has saved me.  || 1 ||   O Saints, my God is forever merciful.
        The Lord of the world does not call His devotee to account; He
        protects His children.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have enshrined
        the Lord's Name within my heart. He has resolved all my affairs.
        The Perfect Guru was pleased, and blessed me, and now, Nanak shall
        never again suffer pain.  || 2 || 21 || 85 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord abides in my mind and body. Everyone congratulates
        me on my victory. This is the glorious greatness of the Perfect
        Guru. His value cannot be described.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice
        to Your Name. He alone, whom You have forgiven, O my Beloved,
        sings Your Praises.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are my Great Lord
        and Master. You are the support of the Saints. Nanak has entered
        God's Sanctuary. The faces of the slanderers are blackened
        with ashes.  || 2 || 22 || 86 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Peace in this world, O my friends, and bliss in the world hereafter
        -  God has given me this. The Transcendent Lord has arranged
        these arrangements; I shall never waver again.  || 1 ||   My mind
        is pleased with the True Lord Master. I know the Lord to be pervading
        all.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> All beings are Yours, O Merciful Lord. You cherish Your devotees.
        Your glorious greatness is wonderful and marvellous. Nanak ever
        meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 2 || 23 || 87
        ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord is always with me. The
        Messenger of Death does not approach me. God holds me close in
        His embrace, and protects me. True are the Teachings of the True
        Guru.  || 1 ||   The Perfect Guru has done it perfectly. He has
        beaten and driven off my enemies, and given me, His slave, the
        sublime understanding of the neutral mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        God has blessed all places with prosperity. I have returned
        again safe and sound. Nanak has entered God's Sanctuary.
        It has eradicated all disease.  || 2 || 24 || 88 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The True Guru is the Giver of all peace and comfort
        -  seek His Sanctuary. Beholding the Blessed Vision of His
        Darshan, bliss ensues, pain is dispelled, and one sings the Lord's
        Praises.  || 1 ||   Drink in the sublime essence of the Lord,
        O Siblings of Destiny. Chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; worship
        the Naam in adoration, and enter the Sanctuary of the Perfect
        Guru.  ||  Pause  ||   Only one who has such pre-ordained destiny
        receives it; he alone becomes perfect, O Siblings of Destiny.
        Nanak's prayer, O Dear God, is to remain lovingly absorbed
        in the Naam.  || 2 || 25 || 89 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The Lord is the Cause of Causes, the Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts; He preserves the honor of His servant. He is hailed
        and congratulated throughout the world, and he tastes the sublime
        essence of the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 1 ||   Dear
        God, Lord of the world, You are my only support. You are all-powerful,
        the Giver of Sanctuary; twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on
        You.  ||  Pause  ||   That humble being, who vibrates upon You,
        O God, is not afflicted by anxiety. Attached to the Feet of the
        True Guru, his fear is dispelled, and within his mind, he sings
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 2 ||   He abides in celestial
        peace and utter ecstasy; the True Guru has comforted him. He has
        returned home victorious, with honor, and his hopes have been
        fulfilled.  || 3 ||   Perfect are the Teachings of the Perfect
        Guru; Perfect are the actions of God. Grasping hold of the Guru's
        feet, Nanak has crossed over the terrifying world-ocean, chanting
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4 || 26 || 90 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Becoming merciful, the Destroyer of the pains of
        the poor has Himself devised all devices. In an instant, He has
        saved His humble servant; the Perfect Guru has cut away his bonds.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate forever on the Guru, the Lord of
        the Universe. All illness shall depart from this body, and you
        shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desires.  ||  Pause
        ||   God created all beings and creatures; He is lofty, inaccessible
        and infinite. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak
        meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; his face is radiant
        in the Court of the Lord.  || 2 || 27 || 91 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I meditate in remembrance on my Lord. Day and night,
        I ever meditate on Him. He gave me His hand, and protected me.
        I drink in the most sublime essence of the Lord's Name.

      <p> I am a sacrifice to my Guru. God, the Great Giver, the Perfect
        One, has become merciful to me, and now, all are kind to me. 
        ||  Pause  ||   Servant Nanak has entered His Sanctuary. He has
        perfectly preserved his honor. All suffering has been dispelled.
        So enjoy peace, O my Siblings of Destiny!  || 2 || 28 || 92 ||
        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  Hear my prayer, O my Lord and Master;
        all beings and creatures were created by You. You preserve the
        honor of Your Name, O Lord, Cause of causes.  || 1 ||   O Dear
        God, Beloved, please, make me Your own. Whether good or bad, I
        am Yours.  ||  Pause  ||   The Almighty Lord and Master heard
        my prayer; cutting away my bonds, He has adorned me. He dressed
        me in robes of honor, and blended His servant with Himself; Nanak
        is revealed in glory throughout the world.  || 2 || 29 || 93 ||
        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  All beings and creatures are subservient
        to all those who serve in the Lord's Court. Their God made
        them His own, and carried them across the terrifying world-ocean.
        || 1 ||   He resolves all the affairs of His Saints. He is merciful
        to the meek, kind and compassionate, the ocean of kindness, my
        Perfect Lord and Master.  ||  Pause  ||   I am asked to come and
        be seated, everywhere I go, and I lack nothing. The Lord blesses
        His humble devotee with robes of honor; O Nanak, the Glory of
        God is manifest.  || 2 || 30 || 94 || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <center>
        SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> O mind, love the Lord. With your ears, hear the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord of the Universe, and with your tongue, sing His song.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, and meditate in remembrance on the Lord; even a sinner like
        yourself will become pure. Death is on the prowl, with its mouth
        wide open, friend.  || 1 ||   Today or tomorrow, eventually it
        will seize you; understand this in your consciousness. Says Nanak,
        meditate, and vibrate upon the Lord; this opportunity is slipping
        away!  || 2 || 1 ||   SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL:  The mind remains
        in the mind. He does not meditate on the Lord, nor does he perform
        service at sacred shrines, and so death seizes him by the hair.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Wife, friends, children, carriages, property,
        total wealth, the entire world  -  know that all of these things
        are false. The Lord's meditation alone is true.  || 1 ||
        Wandering, wandering around for so many ages, he has grown weary,
        and finally, he obtained this human body. Says Nanak, this is
        the opportunity to meet the Lord; why don't you remember
        Him in meditation?  || 2 || 2 ||   SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL:
        O mind, what evil-mindedness have you developed? You are engrossed
        in the pleasures of other men's wives, and slander; you have
        not worshipped the Lord at all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You do not
        know the way to liberation, but you run all around chasing wealth. </p>

      </p>
      <p> In the end, nothing shall go along with you; you have entrapped
        yourself in vain.  || 1 ||   You have not meditated or vibrated
        upon the Lord; you have not served the Guru, or His humble servants;
        spiritual wisdom has not welled up within you. The Immaculate
        Lord is within your heart, and yet you search for Him in the wilderness.
        || 2 ||   Now that you have obtained this human body, meditate
        on the Lord's Feet; Nanak advises with this advice.  || 3
        || 3 ||   SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL:  O mind, contemplate the
        Sanctuary of God. Meditating on Him in remembrance, Ganika the
        prostitute was saved; enshrine His Praises within your heart.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditating on Him in remembrance, Dhroo
        became immortal, and obtained the state of fearlessness. The Lord
        and Master removes suffering in this way  -  why have you forgotten
        Him?  || 1 ||   As soon as the elephant took to the protective
        Sanctuary of the Lord, the ocean of mercy, he escaped from the
        crocodile. How much can I describe the Glorious Praises of the
        Naam? Whoever chants the Lord's Name, his bonds are broken.
        || 2 ||   Ajaamal, known throughout the world as a sinner, was
        redeemed in an instant. Says Nanak, remember the Chintaamani,
        the jewel which fulfills all desires, and you too shall be carried
        across and saved.  || 3 || 4 ||   SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL: 
        What efforts should the mortal make, to attain devotional worship
        of the Lord, and eradicate the fear of death?  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Which actions, what sort of knowledge, and what religion
        -  what Dharma should one practice? What Name of the Guru
        should one remember in meditation, to cross over the terrifying
        world-ocean?  || 1 ||   In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Name
        of the One Lord is the treasure of mercy; chanting it, one obtains
        salvation. No other religion is comparable to this; so speak the
        Vedas.  || 2 ||   He is beyond pain and pleasure, forever unattached;
        He is called the Lord of the world. He dwells deep within your
        inner self, O Nanak, like the image in a mirror.  || 3 || 5 ||
        SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL:  O mother, how can I see the Lord
        of the world? In the utter darkness of emotional attachment and
        spiritual ignorance, my mind remains entangled.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Deluded by doubt, I have wasted my whole life; I have not
        obtained a stable intellect. I remain under the influence of corrupting
        sins, night and day, and I have not renounced wickedness.  ||
        1 ||   I never joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        and I did not sing the Kirtan of God's Praises. O servant
        Nanak, I have no virtues at all; keep me in Your Sanctuary, Lord.
        || 2 || 6 ||   SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL:  O mother, my mind
        is out of control. Night and day, it runs after sin and corruption.
        How can I restrain it?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He listens to the
        teachings of the Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees, but he
        does not enshrine them in his heart, even for an instant. Engrossed
        in the wealth and women of others, his life passes away uselessly.
        || 1 ||   He has gone insane with the wine of Maya, and does
        not understand even a bit of spiritual wisdom. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Deep within his heart, the Immaculate Lord dwells, but he does
        not know this secret.  || 2 ||   When I came to the Sanctuary
        of the Holy Saints, all my evil-mindedness was dispelled. Then,
        O Nanak, I remembered the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills
        all desires, and the noose of Death was snapped.  || 3 || 7 ||
        SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL:  O man, grasp this Truth firmly in
        your soul. The whole world is just like a dream; it will pass
        away in an instant.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Like a wall of sand,
        built up and plastered with great care, which does not last even
        a few days, just so are the pleasures of Maya. Why are you entangled
        in them, you ignorant fool?  || 1 ||   Understand this today  - 
        it is not yet too late! Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord.
        Says Nanak, this is the subtle wisdom of the Holy Saints, which
        I proclaim out loud to you.  || 2 || 8 ||   SORAT'H,  NINTH
        MEHL:  In this world, I have not found any true friend. The whole
        world is attached to its own pleasures, and when trouble comes,
        no one is with you.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Wives, friends, children
        and relatives  -  all are attached to wealth. When they see
        a poor man, they all forsake his company and run away.  || 1 ||
        So what should I say to this crazy mind, which is affectionately
        attached to them? The Lord is the Master of the meek, the Destroyer
        of all fears, and I have forgotten to praise Him.  || 2 ||   Like
        a dog's tail, which will never straighten out, the mind will
        not change, no matter how many things are tried. Says Nanak, please,
        Lord, uphold the honor of Your innate nature; I chant Your Name.
        || 3 || 9 ||   SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL:  O mind, you have not
        accepted the Guru's Teachings. What is the use of shaving
        your head, and wearing saffron robes?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Abandoning
        Truth, you cling to falsehood; your life is uselessly wasting
        away. Practicing hypocrisy, you fill your belly, and then sleep
        like an animal.  || 1 ||   You do not know the Way of the Lord's
        meditation; you have sold yourself into Maya's hands. The
        madman remains entangled in vice and corruption; he has forgotten
        the jewel of the Naam.  || 2 ||   He remains thoughtless, not
        thinking of the Lord of the Universe; his life is uselessly passing
        away. Says Nanak, O Lord, please, confirm your innate nature;
        this mortal is continually making mistakes.  || 3 || 10 ||   SORAT'H,
        NINTH MEHL:  That man, who in the midst of pain, does not feel
        pain, who is not affected by pleasure, affection or fear, and
        who looks alike upon gold and dust; || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Who is
        not swayed by either slander or praise, nor affected by greed,
        attachment or pride; who remains unaffected by joy and sorrow,
        honor and dishonor;  || 1 ||   who renounces all hopes and desires
        and remains desireless in the world; who is not touched by sexual
        desire or anger  -  within his heart, God dwells.  || 2 ||
        That man, blessed by Guru's Grace, understands this way. </p>

        water.  || 3 || 11 ||   SORAT'H,  NINTH MEHL:  O dear friend,
        know this in your mind. The world is entangled in its own pleasures;
        no one is for anyone else.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In good times,
        many come and sit together, surrounding you on all four sides.
        But when hard times come, they all leave, and no one comes near
        you.  || 1 ||   Your wife, whom you love so much, and who has
        remained ever attached to you, runs away crying, &quot;Ghost!
        Ghost!&quot;, as soon as the swan-soul leaves this body.  || 2
        ||   This is the way they act  -  those whom we love so much.
        At the very last moment, O Nanak, no one is any use at all, except
        the Dear Lord.  || 3 || 12 || 139 || </p>

        SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  ASHTAPADEES,  CHAU-TUKAS:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> I am not torn by duality, because I do not worship any other than
        the Lord; I do not visit tombs or crematoriums. I do not enter
        the houses of strangers, engrossed in desire. The Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, has satisfied my desires. Deep within my heart, the
        Guru has shown me the home of my being, and my mind is imbued
        with peace and poise, O Siblings of Destiny. You Yourself are
        all-knowing, and You Yourself are all-seeing; You alone bestow
        intelligence, O Lord.  || 1 ||   My mind is detached, imbued with
        detachment; the Word of the Shabad has pierced my mind, O my mother.
        God's Light shines continually within the nucleus of my deepest
        self; I am lovingly attached to the Bani, the Word of the True
        Lord Master.  ||  Pause  ||   Countless detached renunciates talk
        of detachment and renunciation, but he alone is a true renunciate,
        who is pleasing to the Lord Master. The Word of the Shabad is
        ever in his heart; he is absorbed in the Fear of God, and he works
        to serve the Guru. He remembers the One Lord, his mind does not
        waver, and he restrains its wanderings. He is intoxicated with
        celestial bliss, and is ever imbued with the Lord's Love;
        he sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.  || 2 ||   The
        mind is like the wind, but if it comes to rest in peace, even
        for an instant, then he shall abide in the peace of the Name,
        O Siblings of Destiny. His tongue, eyes and ears are imbued with
        Truth; O Lord, You quench the fires of desire. In hope, the renunciate
        remains free of hopes; in the home of his own inner self, he is
        absorbed in the trance of deep meditation. He remains content,
        satisfied with the charity of the Naam; he drinks in the Ambrosial
        Amrit with ease.  || 3 ||   There is no renunciation in duality,
        as long as there is even a particle of duality. The whole world
        is Yours, Lord; You alone are the Giver. There is not any other,
        O Siblings of Destiny. The self-willed manmukh dwells in misery
        forever, while the Lord bestows greatness upon the Gurmukh. God
        is infinite, endless, inaccessible and unfathomable; His worth
        cannot be described.  || 4 ||   The consciousness in deep Samaadhi,
        the Supreme Being, the Lord of the three worlds  -  these are
        Your Names, Lord. The creatures born into this world have their
        destiny inscribed upon their foreheads; they experience according
        to their destinies. The Lord Himself causes them to do good and
        bad deeds; He Himself makes them steadfast in devotional worship.
        The filth of their mind and mouth is washed off when they live
        in the Fear of God; the inaccessible Lord Himself blesses them
        with spiritual wisdom.  || 5 || </p>

      <p> Only those who taste it know its sweet taste, like the mute, who
        eats the candy, and only smiles. How can I describe the indescribable,
        O Siblings of Destiny? I shall follow His Will forever. If one
        meets with the Guru, the Generous Giver, then he understands;
        those who have no Guru cannot understand this. As the Lord causes
        us to act, so do we act, O Siblings of Destiny. What other clever
        tricks can anyone try?  || 6 ||   Some are deluded by doubt, while
        others are imbued with devotional worship; Your play is infinite
        and endless. As You engage them, they receive the fruits of their
        rewards; You alone are the One who issues Your Commands. I would
        serve You, if anything were my own; my soul and body are Yours.
        One who meets with the True Guru, by His Grace, takes the Support
        of the Ambrosial Naam.  || 7 ||   He dwells in the heavenly realms,
        and his virtues radiantly shine forth; meditation and spiritual
        wisdom are found in virtue. The Naam is pleasing to his mind;
        he speaks it, and causes others to speak it as well. He speaks
        the essential essence of wisdom. The Word of the Shabad is his
        Guru and spiritual teacher, profound and unfathomable; without
        the Shabad, the world is insane. He is a perfect renunciate, naturally
        at ease, O Nanak, whose mind is pleased with the True Lord.  ||
        8 || 1 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL,  TI-TUKAS:  Hope and desire
        are entrapments, O Siblings of Destiny. Religious rituals and
        ceremonies are traps. Because of good and bad deeds, one is born
        into the world, O Siblings of Destiny; forgetting the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, he is ruined. This Maya is the enticer of the
        world, O Siblings of Destiny; all such actions are corrupt.  ||
        1 ||   Listen, O ritualistic Pandit: that religious ritual which
        produces happiness, O Siblings of Destiny, is contemplation of
        the essence of the soul.  ||  Pause  ||   You may stand and recite
        the Shaastras and the Vedas, O Siblings of Destiny, but these
        are just worldly actions. Filth cannot be washed away by hypocrisy,
        O Siblings of Destiny; the filth of corruption and sin is within
        you. This is how the spider is destroyed, O Siblings of Destiny,
        by falling head-long in its own web.  || 2 ||   So many are destroyed
        by their own evil-mindedness, O Siblings of Destiny; in the love
        of duality, they are ruined. Without the True Guru, the Name is
        not obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Name, doubt does
        not depart. If one serves the True Guru, then he obtains peace,
        O Siblings of Destiny; his comings and goings are ended.  || 3
        ||   True celestial peace comes from the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny;
        the immaculate mind is absorbed into the True Lord. One who serves
        the Guru, understands, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Guru,
        the way is not found. What can anyone do, with greed within? O
        Siblings of Destiny, by telling lies, they eat poison.  || 4 ||
        O Pandit, by churning cream, butter is produced. By churning
        water, you shall only see water, O Siblings of Destiny; this world
        is like that. Without the Guru, he is ruined by doubt, O Siblings
        of Destiny; the unseen Divine Lord is in each and every heart.
        || 5 ||   This world is like a thread of cotton, O Siblings of
        Destiny, which Maya has tied on all ten sides. Without the Guru,
        the knots cannot be untied, O Siblings of Destiny; I am so tired
        of religious rituals. This world is deluded by doubt, O Siblings
        of Destiny; no one can say anything about it.  || 6 ||   Meeting
        with the Guru, the Fear of God comes to abide in the mind; to
        die in the Fear of God is one's true destiny. In the Court
        of the Lord, the Naam is far superior to ritualistic cleansing
        baths, charity and good deeds, O Siblings of Destiny. </p>

      <p> One who implants the Naam within himself, through the Guru's
        halter  -  O Siblings of Destiny, the Lord dwells in his mind,
        and he is free of hypocrisy.  || 7 ||   This body is the jeweller's
        shop, O Siblings of Destiny; the incomparable Naam is the merchandise.
        The merchant secures this merchandise, O Siblings of Destiny,
        by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Blessed is
        the merchant, O Nanak, who meets the Guru, and engages in this
        trade.  || 8 || 2 ||   SORAT'H,  FIRST MEHL:  Those who serve
        the True Guru, O Beloved, their companions are saved as well.
        No one blocks their way, O Beloved, and the Lord's Ambrosial
        Nectar is on their tongue. Without the Fear of God, they are so
        heavy that they sink and drown, O Beloved; but the Lord, casting
        His Glance of Grace, carries them across.  || 1 ||   I ever praise
        You, O Beloved, I ever sing Your Praises. Without the boat, one
        is drowned in the sea of fear, O Beloved; how can I reach the
        distant shore?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I praise the Praiseworthy
        Lord, O Beloved; there is no other one to praise. Those who praise
        my God are good, O Beloved; they are imbued with the Word of the
        Shabad, and His Love. If I join them, O Beloved, I can churn the
        essence and so find joy.  || 2 ||   The gateway to honor is Truth,
        O Beloved; it bears the Insignia of the True Name of the Lord.
        We come into the world, and we depart, with our destiny written
        and pre-ordained, O Beloved; realize the Command of the Commander.
        Without the Guru, this Command is not understood, O Beloved; True
        is the Power of the True Lord.  || 3 ||   By His Command, we are
        conceived, O Beloved, and by His Command, we grow in the womb.
        By His Command, we are born, O Beloved, head-first, and upside-down.
        The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the Lord, O Beloved; he
        departs after resolving his affairs.  || 4 ||   By His Command,
        one comes into the world, O Beloved, and by His Will, he goes.
        By His Will, some are bound and gagged and driven away, O Beloved;
        the self-willed manmukhs suffer their punishment. By His Command,
        the Word of the Shabad, is realized, O Beloved, and one goes to
        the Court of the Lord robed in honor.  || 5 ||   By His Command,
        some accounts are accounted for, O Beloved; by His Command, some
        suffer in egotism and duality. By His Command, one wanders in
        reincarnation, O Beloved; deceived by sins and demerits, he cries
        out in his suffering. If he comes to realize the Command of the
        Lord's Will, O Beloved, then he is blessed with Truth and
        Honor.  || 6 ||   It is so difficult to speak it, O Beloved; how
        can we speak, and hear, the True Name? I am a sacrifice to those
        who praise the Lord, O Beloved. I have obtained the Name, and
        I am satisfied, O Beloved; by His Grace, I am united in His Union.
        || 7 ||   If my body were to become the paper, O Beloved, and
        my mind the inkpot; and if my tongue became the pen, O Beloved,
        I would write, and contemplate, the Glorious Praises of the True
        Lord. Blessed is that scribe, O Nanak, who writes the True Name,
        and enshrines it within his heart.  || 8 || 3 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIRST MEHL,  DU-TUKAS:  You are the Giver of virtue, O Immaculate
        Lord, but my mind is not immaculate, O Siblings of Destiny. I
        am a worthless sinner, O Siblings of Destiny; virtue is obtained
        from You alone, Lord.  || 1 ||   O my Beloved Creator Lord, You
        create, and You behold. I am a hypocritical sinner, O Siblings
        of Destiny. </p>

        The poisonous Maya has enticed the consciousness, O Siblings
        of Destiny; through clever tricks, one loses his honor. The True
        Lord and Master abides in the consciousness, O Siblings of Destiny,
        if the Guru's spiritual wisdom permeates it.  || 2 ||   Beautiful,
        beautiful, the Lord is called, O Siblings of Destiny; beautiful,
        like the deep crimson color of the poppy. If man loves the Lord
        with detachment, O Siblings of Destiny, he is judged to be true
        and infallible in the Lord's court and home.  || 3 ||   You
        are pervading the realms of the underworld and the heavenly skies;
        Your wisdom and glories are in each and every heart. Meeting with
        the Guru, one finds peace, O Siblings of Destiny, and pride is
        dispelled from the mind.  || 4 ||   Scrubbing with water, the
        body can be cleaned, O Siblings of Destiny, but the body becomes
        dirty again. Bathing in the supreme essence of spiritual wisdom,
        O Siblings of Destiny, the mind and body become pure.  || 5 ||
        Why worship gods and goddesses, O Siblings of Destiny? What
        can we ask of them? What can they give us? The stone gods are
        washed with water, O Siblings of Destiny, but they just sink in
        the water.  || 6 ||   Without the Guru, the unseen Lord cannot
        be seen, O Siblings of Destiny; the world is drowning, having
        lost its honor. Greatness is in the hands of my Lord and Master,
        O Siblings of Destiny; as He is pleased, He gives.  || 7 ||  
        That soul-bride, who talks sweetly and speaks the Truth, O Siblings
        of Destiny, becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord. Pierced by His
        Love, she abides in Truth, O Siblings of Destiny, deeply imbued
        with the Lord's Name.  || 8 ||   Everyone calls God his own,
        O Siblings of Destiny, but the all-knowing Lord is known only
        through the Guru. Those who are pierced by His Love are saved,
        O Siblings of Destiny; they bear the Insignia of the True Word
        of the Shabad.  || 9 ||   A large pile of firewood, O Siblings
        of Destiny, will burn if a small fire is applied. In the same
        way, if the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells in the heart for
        a moment, even for an instant, O Siblings of Destiny, then one
        meets the Lord with ease, O Nanak.  || 10 || 4 || </p>

      <p> You always preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Dear Lord; You

        Your servant Prahlaad, O Dear Lord, and annihilated Harnaakhash.
        The Gurmukhs place their faith in the Dear Lord, but the self-willed
        manmukhs are deluded by doubt.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, this is
        Your Glory. You preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Lord Master;
        Your devotees seek Your Sanctuary.  ||  Pause  ||   The Messenger
        of Death cannot touch Your devotees; death cannot even approach
        them. The Name of the Lord alone abides in their minds; through
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they find liberation. Wealth and
        all the spiritual powers of the Siddhis fall at the feet of the
        Lord's devotees; they obtain peace and poise from the Guru.
        || 2 ||   The self-willed manmukhs have no faith; they are filled
        with greed and self-interest. They are not Gurmukh  -  they
        do not understand the Word of the Shabad in their hearts; they
        do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Their masks of falsehood
        and hypocrisy shall fall off; the self-willed manmukhs speak with
        insipid words.  || 3 ||   You are pervading through Your devotees,

        You alone are the Architect of Destiny. Overcoming my egotism

        the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 4 ||   God automatically
        does the work of those who love the Name of the Lord. By Guru's
        Grace, he ever dwells in their minds, and He resolves all their
        affairs. Whoever challenges them is destroyed; they have the Lord
        God as their Savior.  || 5 ||   Without serving the True Guru,
        no one finds the Lord; the self-willed manmukhs die crying out
        in pain. They come and go, and find no place of rest; in pain
        and suffering, they perish. But one who becomes Gurmukh drinks
        in the Ambrosial Nectar, and is easily absorbed in the True Name.
        || 6 ||   Without serving the True Guru, one cannot escape reincarnation,
        even by performing numerous rituals. Those who read the Vedas,
        and argue and debate without the Lord, lose their honor. True
        is the True Guru, and True is the Word of His Bani; in the Guru's
        Sanctuary, one is saved.  || 7 ||   Those whose minds are filled
        with the Lord are judged as true in the Court of the Lord; they
        are hailed as true in the True Court. Their praises echo throughout
        the ages, and no one can erase them. Nanak is forever a sacrifice

        by contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. They got on board
        the boat of the True Guru, who carried them across the terrifying
        world-ocean, O Siblings of Destiny.  || 2 ||   I have been transformed
        from rusty iron into gold, O Siblings of Destiny, united in Union
        with the Guru, the Philosopher's Stone. Eliminating my self-conceit,
        the Name has come to dwell within my mind, O Siblings of Destiny;
        my light has merged in the Light.  || 3 ||   I am a sacrifice,
        I am a sacrifice, O Siblings of Destiny, I am forever a sacrifice
        to my True Guru. He has given me the treasure of the Naam; O Siblings
        of Destiny, through the Guru's Teachings, I am absorbed in
        celestial bliss.  || 4 ||   Without the Guru, celestial peace
        is not produced, O Siblings of Destiny; go and ask the spiritual
        teachers about this. Serve the True Guru forever, O Siblings of
        Destiny, and eradicate self-conceit from within.  || 5 ||   Under
        Guru's Instruction, the Fear of God is produced, O Siblings
        of Destiny; true and excellent are the deeds done in the Fear
        of God. Then, one is blessed with the treasure of the Lord's
        Love, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Support of the True Name.
        || 6 ||   I fall at the feet of those who serve their True Guru,
        O Siblings of Destiny. I have fulfilled my life, O Siblings of
        Destiny, and my family has been saved as well.  || 7 ||   The
        True Word of the Guru's Bani, and the True Word of the Shabad,
        O Siblings of Destiny, are obtained only by Guru's Grace. <br>
