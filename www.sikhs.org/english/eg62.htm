        DHANAASAREE,  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  CHAU-PADAS:
        <p> <b>ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD. </b> </p>
        <p> <b>TRUTH IS THE NAME. </b> </p>
        <p> CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED.  NO FEAR.  NO HATRED. </p>
        <p> IMAGE OF THE UNDYING.  BEYOND BIRTH.  SELF-EXISTENT. </p>
        <p> BY GURU'S GRACE:</p>
      </center>
      <p> My soul is afraid; to whom should I complain? I serve Him, who
        makes me forget my pains; He is the Giver, forever and ever. 
        || 1 ||   My Lord and Master is forever new; He is the Giver,
        forever and ever.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Night and day, I serve
        my Lord and Master; He shall save me in the end. Hearing and listening,
        O my dear sister, I have crossed over.  || 2 ||   O Merciful Lord,
        Your Name carries me across. I am forever a sacrifice to You.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In all the world, there is only the One
        True Lord; there is no other at all. He alone serves the Lord,
        upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace.  || 3 ||   Without
        You, O Beloved, how could I even live? Bless me with such greatness,
        that I may remain attached to Your Name. There is no other, O
        Beloved, to whom I can go and speak.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I serve
        my Lord and Master; I ask for no other. Nanak is His slave; moment
        by moment, bit by bit, he is a sacrifice to Him.  || 4 ||   O
        Lord Master, I am a sacrifice to Your Name, moment by moment,
        bit by bit.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 4 || 1 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIRST
        MEHL:  We are human beings of the briefest moment; we do not know
        the appointed time of our departure. Prays Nanak, serve the One,
        to whom our soul and breath of life belong.  || 1 ||   You are
        blind  -  see and consider, how many days your life shall last.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My breath, my flesh and my soul are all
        Yours, Lord; You are so very dear to me. Nanak, the poet, says
        this, O True Lord Cherisher.  || 2 ||   If you gave nothing, O
        my Lord and Master, what could anyone pledge to You? Nanak prays,
        we receive that which we are pre-destined to receive.  || 3 ||
        The deceitful person does not remember the Lord's Name;
        he practices only deceit. </p>

      <p> When he is marched in chains to Death's door, then, he regrets
        his actions.  || 4 ||   As long as we are in this world, O Nanak,
        we should listen, and speak of the Lord. I have searched, but
        I have found no way to remain here; so, remain dead while yet
        alive.  || 5 || 2 || </p>

      <center>
        DHANAASAREE,  FIRST MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> How can I remember the Lord in meditation? I cannot meditate on
        Him in remembrance. My heart is burning, and my soul is crying
        out in pain. The True Lord creates and adorns. Forgetting Him,
        how can one be good?  || 1 ||   By clever tricks and commands,
        He cannot be found. How am I to meet my True Lord, O my mother?
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   How rare is the one who goes out, and searches
        for the merchandise of the Naam. No one tastes it, and no one
        eats it. Honor is not obtained by trying to please other people.
        One's honor is preserved, only if the Lord preserves it.
        || 2 ||   Wherever I look, there I see Him, pervading and permeating.
        Without You, I have no other place of rest. He may try, but what
        can anyone do by his own doing? He alone is blessed, whom the
        True Lord forgives.  || 3 ||   Now, I shall have to get up and
        depart, in an instant, in the clapping of hands. What face will
        I show the Lord? I have no virtue at all. As is the Lord's
        Glance of Grace, so it is. Without His Glance of Grace, O Nanak,
        no one is blessed.  || 4 || 1 || 3 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIRST MEHL:
        If the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, then one remembers Him
        in meditation. The soul is softened, and he remains absorbed in
        the Lord's Love. His soul and the Supreme Soul become one.
        The duality of the inner mind is overcome.  || 1 ||   By Guru's
        Grace, God is found. One's consciousness is attached to the
        Lord, and so Death does not devour him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||  
        Remembering the True Lord in meditation, one is enlightened. Then,
        in the midst of Maya, he remains detached. Such is the Glory of
        the True Guru; in the midst of children and spouses, they attain
        emancipation.  || 2 ||   Such is the service which the Lord's
        servant performs, that he dedicates his soul to the Lord, to whom
        it belongs. One who is pleasing to the Lord and Master is acceptable.
        Such a servant obtains honor in the Court of the Lord.  || 3 ||
        He enshrines the image of the True Guru in his heart. He obtains
        the rewards which he desires. The True Lord and Master grants
        His Grace; how can such a servant be afraid of death?  || 4 ||
        Prays Nanak, practice contemplation, and enshrine love for the
        True Word of His Bani. Then, you shall find the Gate of Salvation.
        This Shabad is the most excellent of all chanting and austere
        meditations.  || 5 || 2 || 4 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIRST MEHL:  My
        soul burns, over and over again. Burning and burning, it is ruined,
        and it falls into evil. That body, which forgets the Word of the
        Guru's Bani, cries out in pain, like a chronic patient. 
        || 1 ||   To speak too much and babble is useless. Even without
        our speaking, He knows everything.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He created
        our ears, eyes and nose. </p>
      <p>
        <center>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> He gave us our tongue to speak so fluently. He preserved the mind
        in the fire of the womb; at His Command, the wind blows everywhere.
        || 2 ||   These worldly attachments, loves and pleasurable tastes,
        all are just black stains. One who departs, with these black stains
        of sin on his face shall find no place to sit in the Court of
        the Lord.  || 3 ||   By Your Grace, we chant Your Name. Becoming
        attached to it, one is saved; there is no other way. Even if one
        is drowning, still, he may be saved. O Nanak, the True Lord is
        the Giver of all.  || 4 || 3 || 5 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIRST MEHL:
        If a thief praises someone, his mind is not pleased. If a thief
        curses him, no damage is done. No one will take responsibility
        for a thief. How can a thief's actions be good?  || 1 ||
        Listen, O mind, you blind, false dog! Even without your speaking,
        the Lord knows and understands.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   A thief
        may be handsome, and a thief may be wise, but he is still just
        a counterfeit coin, worth only a shell. If it is kept and mixed
        with other coins, it will be found to be false, when the coins
        are inspected.  || 2 ||   As one acts, so does he receive. As
        he plants, so does he eat. He may praise himself gloriously, but
        still, according to his understanding, so is the path he must
        follow.  || 3 ||   He may tell hundreds of lies to conceal his
        falsehood, and all the world may call him good. If it pleases
        You, Lord, even the foolish are approved. O Nanak, the Lord is
        wise, knowing, all-knowing.  || 4 || 4 || 6 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        FIRST MEHL:  The body is the paper, and the mind is the inscription
        written upon it. The ignorant fool does not read what is written
        on his forehead. In the Court of the Lord, three inscriptions
        are recorded. Behold, the counterfeit coin is worthless there.
        || 1 ||   O Nanak, if there is silver in it, then everyone proclaims,
  &quot;It is genuine, it is genuine.&quot;  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        The Qazi tells lies and eats filth; the Brahmin kills and then
        takes cleansing baths. The Yogi is blind, and does not know the
        Way. The three of them devise their own destruction.  || 2 ||
        He alone is a Yogi, who understands the Way. By Guru's
        Grace, he knows the One Lord. He alone is a Qazi, who turns away
        from the world, and who, by Guru's Grace, remains dead while
        yet alive. He alone is a Brahmin, who contemplates God. He saves
        himself, and saves all his generations as well.  || 3 ||   One
        who cleanses his own mind is wise. One who cleanses himself of
        impurity is a Muslim. One who reads and understands is acceptable.
        Upon his forehead is the Insignia of the Court of the Lord.  ||

      </center>
      <p> No, no, this is not the time, when people know the way to Yoga
        and Truth. The holy places of worship in the world are polluted,
        and so the world is drowning.  || 1 ||   In this Dark Age of Kali
        Yuga, the Lord's Name is the most sublime. Some people try
        to deceive the world by closing their eyes and holding their nostrils
        closed.  || 1 ||  Pause  || </p>

      <p> They close off their nostrils with their fingers, and claim to
        see the three worlds. But they cannot even see what is behind
        them. What a strange lotus pose this is!  || 2 ||   The K'shatriyas
        have abandoned their religion, and have adopted a foreign language.
        The whole world has been reduced to the same social status; the
        state of righteousness and Dharma has been lost.  || 3 ||   They
        study and analyze the Puraanas and the Vedas, but without the
        Lord's Name, no one is liberated; so says Nanak, the Lord's
        slave.  || 4 || 1 || 6 || 8 || </p>

      <p> In the bowl of the sky, the sun and moon are the lamps; the stars
        in the constellations are the pearls. The fragrance of sandalwood
        is the incense, the wind is the fan, and all the vegetation are
        flowers in offering to You, O Luminous Lord.  || 1 ||   What a
        beautiful lamp-lit worship service this is! O Destroyer of fear,
        this is Your Aartee, Your worship service. The sound current of
        the Shabad is the sounding of the temple drums.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Thousands are Your eyes, and yet You have no eyes. Thousands
        are Your forms, and yet You have not even one form. Thousands
        are Your lotus feet, and yet You have no feet. Without a nose,
        thousands are Your noses. I am enchanted with Your play!  || 2
        ||   The Divine Light is within everyone; You are that Light.
        Yours is that Light which shines within everyone. By the Guru's
        Teachings, this Divine Light is revealed. That which pleases the
        Lord is the true worship service.  || 3 ||   My soul is enticed
        by the honey-sweet lotus feet of the Lord; night and day, I thirst
        for them. Bless Nanak, the thirsty song-bird, with the water of
        Your Mercy, that he may come to dwell in Your Name.  || 4 || 1

      </center>
      <p> This wealth is inexhaustible. It shall never be exhausted, and
        it shall never be lost. The Perfect True Guru has revealed it
        to me. I am forever a sacrifice to my True Guru. By Guru's
        Grace, I have enshrined the Lord within my mind.  || 1 ||   They
        alone are wealthy, who lovingly attune themselves to the Lord's
        Name. The Perfect Guru has revealed to me the Lord's treasure;
        by the Lord's Grace, it has come to abide in my mind.  ||
        Pause  ||   He is rid of his demerits, and his heart is permeated
        with merit and virtue. By Guru's Grace, he naturally dwells
        in celestial peace. True is the Word of the Perfect Guru's
        Bani. They bring peace to the mind, and celestial peace is absorbed
        within.  || 2 ||   O my humble Siblings of Destiny, behold this
        strange and wonderful thing: duality is overcome, and the Lord
        dwells within his mind. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is priceless;
        it cannot be taken. By Guru's Grace, it comes to abide in
        the mind.  || 3 ||   He is the One God, abiding within all. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, He is revealed in the heart. </p>

      <p> One who intuitively knows and realizes God, O Nanak, obtains the
        Naam; his mind is pleased and appeased.  || 4 || 1 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        THIRD MEHL:  The wealth of the Lord's Name is immaculate,
        and absolutely infinite. The Word of the Guru's Shabad is
        over-flowing with treasure. Know that, except for the wealth of
        the Name, all other wealth is poison. The egotistical people are
        burning in their attachment to Maya.  || 1 ||   How rare is that
        Gurmukh who tastes the sublime essence of the Lord. He is always
        in bliss, day and night; through perfect good destiny, he obtains
        the Name.  ||  Pause  ||   The Word of the Shabad is a lamp, illuminating
        the three worlds. One who tastes it, becomes immaculate. The immaculate
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, washes off the filth of ego. True
        devotional worship brings lasting peace.  || 2 ||   One who tastes
        the sublime essence of the Lord is the Lord's humble servant.
        He is forever happy; he is never sad. He himself is liberated,
        and he liberates others as well. He chants the Lord's Name,
        and through the Lord, he finds peace.  || 3 ||   Without the True
        Guru, everyone dies, crying out in pain. Night and day, they burn,
        and find no peace. But meeting the True Guru, all thirst is quenched.
        O Nanak, through the Naam, one finds peace and tranquility.  ||
        4 || 2 ||   DHANAASAREE,  THIRD MEHL:  Gather in and cherish forever
        the wealth of the Lord's Name, deep within; He cherishes
        and nurtures all beings and creatures. They alone obtain the treasure
        of Liberation, who are lovingly imbued with, and focused on the
        Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   Serving the Guru, one obtains the
        wealth of the Lord's Name. He is illumined and enlightened
        within, and he meditates on the Lord's Name.  ||  Pause 
        ||   This love for the Lord is like the love of the bride for
        her husband. God ravishes and enjoys the soul-bride who is adorned
        with peace and tranquility. No one finds God through egotism.
        Wandering away from the Primal Lord, the root of all, one wastes
        his life in vain.  || 2 ||   Tranquility, celestial peace, pleasure
        and the Word of His Bani come from the Guru. True is that service,
        which leads one to merge in the Naam. Blessed with the Word of
        the Shabad, he meditates forever on the Lord, the Beloved. Through
        the True Name, glorious greatness is obtained.  || 3 ||   The
        Creator Himself abides throughout the ages. If He casts His Glance
        of Grace, then we meet Him. Through the Word of Gurbani, the Lord
        comes to dwell in the mind. O Nanak, God unites with Himself those
        who are imbued with Truth.  || 4 || 3 ||   DHANAASAREE,  THIRD
        MEHL:  The world is polluted, and those in the world become polluted
        as well. In attachment to duality, it comes and goes. This love
        of duality has ruined the entire world. The self-willed manmukh
        suffers punishment, and forfeits his honor.  || 1 ||   Serving
        the Guru, one becomes immaculate. He enshrines the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, within, and his state becomes exalted.  ||  Pause
        ||   The Gurmukhs are saved, taking to the Lord's Sanctuary.
        Attuned to the Lord's Name, they commit themselves to devotional
        worship. The Lord's humble servant performs devotional worship,
        and is blessed with greatness. Attuned to Truth, he is absorbed
        in celestial peace.  || 2 ||   Know that one who purchases the
        True Name is very rare. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        he comes to understand himself. True is his capital, and true
        is his trade. Blessed is that person, who loves the Naam.  ||
        3 ||   God, the True Lord, has attached some to His True Name. </p>

      <p> They listen to the most sublime Word of His Bani, and the Word
        of His Shabad. True is service to the True Lord God. O Nanak,
        the Naam is the Embellisher.  || 4 || 4 ||   DHANAASAREE,  THIRD
        MEHL:  I am a sacrifice to those who serve the Lord. The Truth
        is in their hearts, and the True Name is on their lips. Dwelling
        upon the Truest of the True, their pains are dispelled. Through
        the True Word of the Shabad, the Lord comes to dwell in their
        minds.  || 1 ||   Listening to the Word of Gurbani, filth is washed
        off, and they naturally enshrine the Lord's Name in their
        minds.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   One who conquers fraud, deceit and
        the fire of desire finds tranquility, peace and pleasure within.
        If one walks in harmony with the Guru's Will, he eliminates
        his self-conceit. He finds the True Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 2 || 
        The blind, self-willed manmukh does not understand the Shabad;
        he does not know the Word of the Guru's Bani, and so he passes
        his life in misery. But if he meets the True Guru, then he finds
        peace, and the ego within is silenced.  || 3 ||   Who else should
        I speak to? The One Lord is the Giver of all. When He grants His
        Grace, then we obtain the Word of the Shabad. Meeting with my
        Beloved, I sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. O Nanak,
        becoming truthful, I have become pleasing to the True Lord.  ||
        4 || 5 ||   DHANAASAREE,  THIRD MEHL:  When the mind is conquered,
        its turbulent wanderings are stopped. Without conquering the mind,
        how can the Lord be found? Rare is the one who knows the medicine
        to conquer the mind. The mind is conquered through the Word of
        the Shabad; this is known to the Lord's humble servant. 
        || 1 ||   The Lord forgives him, and blesses him with glory. By
        Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind.  ||  Pause
        ||   The Gurmukh does good deeds, and so, he comes to understand
        this mind. The mind is intoxicated, like the elephant with wine.
        The Guru places the harness upon it, and rejuvenates it.  || 2
        ||   The mind is undisciplined; only a rare few can discipline
        it. If someone eats the uneatable, then he becomes immaculate.
        As Gurmukh, his mind is embellished. Egotism and corruption are
        eradicated from within.  || 3 ||   Those whom the Primal Lord
        keeps united in His Union, shall never be separated from Him;
        they are merged in the Word of the Shabad. Only God Himself knows
        His own power. O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord.  || 4 || 6 ||    DHANAASAREE,  THIRD MEHL:  The ignorant
        fools amass false wealth. The blind, foolish, self-willed manmukhs
        have gone astray. Poisonous wealth brings constant pain. It will
        not go with you, and it will not yield any profit.  || 1 ||  
        True wealth is obtained through the Guru's Teachings. False
        wealth continues coming and going.  ||  Pause  ||   The foolish
        self-willed manmukhs all go astray and die. They drown in the
        terrifying world-ocean, and they cannot reach either this shore,
        or the one beyond. But by perfect destiny, they meet the True
        Guru; imbued with the True Name, day and night, they remain detached
        from the world.  || 2 ||   Throughout the four ages, the True
        Bani of His Word is Ambrosial Nectar. By perfect destiny, one
        is absorbed in the True Name. The Siddhas, the seekers and all
        men long for the Name. It is obtained only by perfect destiny.
        || 3 ||   The True Lord is everything; He is True. Only a few
        realize the exalted Lord God. He is the Truest of the True; He
        Himself implants the True Name within. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, the Lord Himself sees all; He Himself links us to the
        Truth.  || 4 || 7 ||    DHANAASAREE,  THIRD MEHL:  The value and
        worth of the Lord's Name cannot be described. Blessed are
        those humble beings, who lovingly focus their minds on the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord. True are the Guru's Teachings, and
        True is contemplative meditation. God Himself forgives, and bestows
        contemplative meditation.  || 1 ||   The Lord's Name is wonderful!
        God Himself imparts it. In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Gurmukhs
        obtain it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   We are ignorant; ignorance fills
        our minds. We do all our deeds in ego. By Guru's Grace, egotism
        is eradicated. Forgiving us, the Lord blends us with Himself.
        || 2 ||   Poisonous wealth gives rise to great arrogance. Drowning
        in egotism, no one is honored. Forsaking self-conceit, one finds
        lasting peace. Under Guru's Instruction, he praises the True
        Lord.  || 3 ||   The Creator Lord Himself fashions all. Without
        Him, there is no other at all. He alone is attached to Truth,
        whom the Lord Himself so attaches. O Nanak, through the Naam,
        lasting peace is attained in the hereafter.  || 4 || 8 || </p>

        with Your Name, so that I may forever remain imbued with Your
        Love.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice to Your Name, O True Lord. The
        One Lord is the Cause of causes; there is no other at all.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   I was wretched; I wandered through so many cycles
        of reincarnation. Now, Lord, please bless me with Your Grace.
        Be merciful, and grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan;
        please grant me such a gift.  || 2 ||   Prays Nanak, the shutters
        of doubt have been opened wide; by Guru's Grace, I have come

      <p> Those Saints and devotees who serve the Lord have all their sins

        in the Sangat, the Congregation that You love.  || 1 ||   I cannot
        even speak the Praises of the Lord, the Gardener of the world.
        We are sinners, sinking like stones in water; grant Your Grace,
        and carry us stones across.  ||  Pause  ||   The rust of poison
        and corruption from countless incarnations sticks to us; joining
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, it is cleaned away.
        It is just like gold, which is heated in the fire, to remove the
        impurities from it.  || 2 ||   I chant the chant of the Name of
        the Lord, day and night; I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
        Har, and enshrine it within my heart. The Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, Har, is the most perfect medicine in this world; chanting
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have conquered my ego.  || 3

        servant, O Life of the world, and save the honor of servant Nanak.
        || 4 || 1 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The humble Saints
        of the Lord meditate on the Lord; their pain, doubt and fear have
        run away. The Lord Himself inspires them to serve Him; they are
        awakened within to the Guru's Teachings.  || 1 ||   Imbued
        with the Lord's Name, they are unattached to the world. Listening
        to the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, their minds are pleased;
        through Guru's Instruction, they enshrine love for the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God, the Lord and Master, is the caste and
        social status of His humble Saints. You are the Lord and Master;
        I am just Your puppet. As is the understanding You bless us with,
        so are the words we speak.  || 2 ||   What are we? Tiny worms,
        and microscopic germs. You are our great and glorious Lord and
        Master. I cannot describe Your state and extent. O God, how can
        we unfortunate ones meet with You?  || 3 ||   O God, my Lord and
        Master, shower me with Your Mercy, and commit me to Your service.
        Make Nanak the slave of Your slaves, God; I speak the speech of
        the Lord's sermon.  || 4 || 2 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:
        The True Guru is the Lord's Saint, the True Being, who chants
        the Bani of the Lord, Har, Har. Whoever chants it, and listens
        to it, is liberated; I am forever a sacrifice to him.  || 1 ||
        O Saints of the Lord, listen to the Lord's Praises with
        your ears. Listen to the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, for a moment,
        for even an instant, and all your sins and mistakes shall be erased.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who find such humble, Holy Saints,
        are the greatest of the great persons. I beg for the dust of their
        feet; I long for the longing for God, my Lord and Master.  ||
        2 ||   The Name of God, the Lord and Master, Har, Har, is the
        fruit-bearing tree; those who meditate on it are satisfied. Drinking
        in the ambrosia of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am satisfied;
        all my hunger and thirst is quenched.  || 3 ||   Those who are
        blessed with the highest, loftiest destiny, chant and meditate
        on the Lord. Let me join their congregation, O God, my Lord and
        Master; Nanak is the slave of their slaves.  || 4 || 3 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        FOURTH MEHL:  I am blind, totally blind, entangled in corruption
        and poison. How can I walk on the Guru's Path? If the True
        Guru, the Giver of peace, shows His kindness, He attaches us to
        the hem of His robe.  || 1 ||   O Sikhs of the Guru, O friends,
        walk on the Guru's Path. Whatever the Guru says, accept that
        as good; the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is unique and wonderful.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Saints of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny,
        listen: serve the Guru, quickly now! Let your service to the True
        Guru be your supplies on the Lord's Path; pack them up, and
        don't think of today or tomorrow.  || 2 ||   O Saints of
        the Lord, chant the chant of the Lord's Name; the Lord's
        Saints walk with the Lord. Those who meditate on the Lord, become
        the Lord; the playful, wondrous Lord meets them.  || 3 ||   To
        chant the chant of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, is the longing

        God, please bless me with Your Mercy, and pour Your Name into
        my mouth, even if for only an instant.  || 1 ||   Without the
        Lord, I cannot live for even a second. Like the addict who dies
        without his drug, I die without the Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   You,
        Lord, are the deepest, most unfathomable ocean; I cannot find
        even a trace of Your limits. You are the most remote of the remote,
        limitless and transcendent; O Lord Master, You alone know Your
        state and extent.  || 2 ||   The Lord's humble Saints meditate
        on the Lord; they are imbued with the deep crimson color of the
        Guru's Love. Meditating on the Lord, they attain great glory,
        and the most sublime honor.  || 3 ||   He Himself is the Lord
        and Master, and He Himself is the servant; He Himself creates
        His environments. Servant Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary, O
        Lord; protect and preserve the honor of Your devotee.  || 4 ||
        5 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  Tell me, O Siblings of Destiny,
        the religion for this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. I seek emancipation
        -  how can I be emancipated? Meditation on the Lord, Har,
        Har, is the boat, the raft; meditating on the Lord, the swimmer
        swims across.  || 1 ||   O Dear Lord, protect and preserve the
        honor of Your humble servant. O Lord, Har, Har, please make me
        chant the chant of Your Name; I beg only for Your devotional worship.
        ||  Pause  ||   The Lord's servants are very dear to the
        Lord; they chant the Word of the Lord's Bani. The account
        of the recording angels, Chitr and Gupt, and the account with
        the Messenger of Death is totally erased.  || 2 ||   The Saints
        of the Lord meditate on the Lord in their minds; they join the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. The piercing sun of desires
        has set, and the cool moon has risen.  || 3 ||   You are the Greatest
        Being, absolutely unapproachable and unfathomable; You created
        the Universe from Your Own Being. O God, take pity on servant
        Nanak, and make him the slave of the slave of Your slaves.  ||

        I have come to be in love with the Lord. I have forgotten my cares

        O Nanak, the Lord has become my friend and companion.  || 2 ||

        of the Lord.  || 1 ||   O mind, meditate on the Lord, the Lord

        O friend. You shall be happy forever, day and night; sing the
        Praises of the Lord, the Lord of the world-forest.  ||  Pause
        ||   When the Lord, Har, Har, casts His Glance of Grace, then
        I made the effort in my mind; meditating on the Name of the Lord,

        Nanak, O my Lord and Master; I have come seeking Your Sanctuary.
        || 2 || 3 || 9 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The eighty-four
        Siddhas, the spiritual masters, the Buddhas, the thirty-three
        million gods and the silent sages, all long for Your Name, O Dear
        Lord. By Guru's Grace, a rare few obtain it; upon their foreheads,
        the pre-ordained destiny of loving devotion is written.  || 1
        ||   O mind, chant the Name of the Lord; singing the Lord's
        Praises is the most exalted activity. I am forever a sacrifice

        they sing the sublime Bani of the Lord, Har, Har. Their singing
        and listening is approved by the Lord; they accept the Order of
        the True Guru as True, totally True.  || 1 ||   Chant the Lord's
        Praises, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is the sacred shrine
        of pilgrimage in the terrifying world-ocean. They alone are praised
        in the Court of the Lord, O Saints, who know and understand the
        Lord's sermon.  ||  Pause  ||   He Himself is the Guru, and
        He Himself is the disciple; the Lord God Himself plays His wondrous
        games. O servant Nanak, he alone merges with the Lord, whom the
        Lord Himself merges; all the others are forsaken, but the Lord
        loves him.  || 2 || 5 || 11 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  The
        Lord is the Fulfiller of desires, the Giver of total peace; the
        Kaamadhaynaa, the wish-fulfilling cow, is in His power. So meditate
        on such a Lord, O my soul. </p>
