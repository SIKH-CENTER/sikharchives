      <p> Through the Word of the True Guru's Shabad, I know Him. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Lured by sexual desire, the elephant is trapped;
        the poor beast falls into the power of another. Lured by the sound
        of the hunter's bell, the deer offers its head; because of
        this enticement, it is killed.  || 2 ||   Gazing upon his family,
        the mortal is enticed by greed; he clings in attachment to Maya.
        Totally engrossed in worldly things, he considers them to be his
        own; but in the end, he shall surely have to leave them behind.
        || 3 ||   Know it well, that anyone who loves any other than
        God, shall be miserable forever. Says Nanak, the Guru has explained
        this to me, that love for God brings lasting bliss.  || 4 || 2
        ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Granting His Grace, God has blessed
        me with His Name, and released me of my bonds. I have forgotten
        all worldly entanglements, and I am attached to the Guru's
        feet.  || 1 ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        I have renounced my other cares and anxieties. I dug a deep pit,
        and buried my egotistical pride, emotional attachment and the
        desires of my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   No one is my enemy,
        and I am no one's enemy. God, who expanded His expanse, is
        within all; I learned this from the True Guru.  || 2 ||   I am
        a friend to all; I am everyone's friend. When the sense of
        separation was removed from my mind, then I was united with the
        Lord, my King.  || 3 ||   My stubbornness is gone, Ambrosial Nectar
        rains down, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad seems so sweet
        to me. He is pervading everywhere, in the water, on the land and
        in the sky; Nanak beholds the all-pervading Lord.  || 4 || 3 ||
        DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Ever since I obtained the Blessed
        Vision of the Darshan of the Holy, my days have been blessed and
        prosperous. I have found lasting bliss, singing the Kirtan of
        the Praises of the Primal Lord, the Architect of destiny.  ||
        1 ||   Now, I sing the Praises of the Lord within my mind. My
        mind has been illumined and enlightened, and it is always at peace;
        I have found the Perfect True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        Lord, the treasure of virtue, abides deep within the heart, and
        so pain, doubt and fear have been dispelled. I have obtained the
        most incomprehensible thing, enshrining love for the Name of the
        Lord.  || 2 ||   I was anxious, and now I am free of anxiety;
        I was worried, and now I am free of worry; my grief, greed and
        emotional attachments are gone. By His Grace, I am cured of the
        disease of egotism, and the Messenger of Death no longer terrifies
        me.  || 3 ||   Working for the Guru, serving the Guru and the
        Guru's Command, all are pleasing to me. Says Nanak, He has
        released me from the clutches of Death; I am a sacrifice to that
        Guru.  || 4 || 4 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Body, mind, wealth
        and everything belong to Him; He alone is all-wise and all-knowing.
        He listens to my pains and pleasures, and then my condition improves.
        || 1 ||   My soul is satisfied with the One Lord alone. People
        make all sorts of other efforts, but they have no value at all.
        ||  Pause  ||   The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is
        a priceless jewel. The Guru has given me this advice. It cannot
        be lost, and it cannot be shaken off; it remains steady, and I
        am perfectly satisfied with it.  || 2 ||   Those things which
        tore me away from You, Lord, are now gone. </p>

      <p> When golden ornaments are melted down into a lump, they are still
        said to be gold.  || 3 ||   The Divine Light has illuminated me,
        and I am filled with celestial peace and glory; the unstruck melody
        of the Lord's Bani resounds within me. Says Nanak, I have
        built my eternal home; the Guru has constructed it for me.  ||
        4 || 5 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The desires of the greatest
        of the great kings and landlords cannot be satisfied. They remain
        engrossed in Maya, intoxicated with the pleasures of their wealth;
        their eyes see nothing else at all.  || 1 ||   No one has ever
        found satisfaction in sin and corruption. The flame is not satisfied
        by more fuel; how can one be satisfied without the Lord?  || 
        Pause  ||   Day after day, he eats his meals with many different
        foods, but his hunger is not eradicated. He runs around like a
        dog, searching in the four directions.  || 2 ||   The lustful,
        lecherous man desires many women, and he never stops peeking into
        the homes of others. Day after day, he commits adultery again
        and again, and then he regrets his actions; he wastes away in
        misery and greed.  || 3 ||   The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is
        incomparable and priceless; it is the treasure of Ambrosial Nectar.
        The Saints abide in peace, poise and bliss; O Nanak, through the
        Guru, this is known.  || 4 || 6 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Nothing which this mortal being runs after, can compare to it.
        He alone comes to have it, whom the Guru blesses with this Ambrosial
        Nectar.  || 1 ||   The desire to eat, to wear new clothes, and
        all other desires, do not abide in the mind of one who comes to
        know the subtle essence of the One Lord.  ||  Pause  ||   The
        mind and body blossom forth in abundance, when one receives even
        a drop of this Nectar. I cannot express His glory; I cannot describe
        His worth.  || 2 ||   We cannot meet the Lord by our own efforts,
        nor can we meet Him through service; He comes and meets us spontaneously.
        One who is blessed by my Lord Master's Grace, practices the
        Teachings of the Guru's Mantra.  || 3 ||   He is merciful
        to the meek, always kind and compassionate; He cherishes and nurtures
        all beings. The Lord is mingled with Nanak, through and through;
        He cherishes him, like the mother her child.  || 4 || 7 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has implanted the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within me. In the utter darkness of
        the wilderness, He showed me the straight path.  || 1 ||   The
        Lord of the universe, the Cherisher of the world, He is my breath
        of life. Here and hereafter, he takes care of everything for me.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Meditating on Him in remembrance, I have
        found all treasures, respect, greatness and perfect honor. Remembering
        His Name, millions of sins are erased; all His devotees long for
        the dust of His feet.  || 2 ||   If someone wishes for the fulfillment
        of all his hopes and desires, he should serve the one supreme
        treasure. He is the Supreme Lord God, infinite Lord and Master;
        meditating on Him in remembrance, one is carried across. || 3
        ||   I have found total peace and tranquility in the Society of
        the Saints; my honor has been preserved. To gather in the Lord's
        wealth, and to taste the food of the Lord's Name  - </p>

      <p> Nanak has made this his feast.  || 4 || 8 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  You have made it your habit to practice those deeds which
        will bring you shame. You slander the Saints, and you worship
        the faithless cynics; such are the corrupt ways you have adopted.
        || 1 ||   Deluded by your emotional attachment to Maya, you love
        other things, like the enchanted city of Hari-chandauree, or the
        green leaves of the forest  -  such is your way of life.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Its body may be anointed with sandalwood oil,
        but the donkey still loves to roll in the mud. He is not fond
        of the Ambrosial Nectar; instead, he loves the poisonous drug
        of corruption.  || 2 ||   The Saints are noble and sublime; they
        are blessed with good fortune. They alone are pure and holy in
        this world. The jewel of this human life is passing away uselessly,
        lost in exchange for mere glass.  || 3 ||   The sins and sorrows
        of uncounted incarnations run away, when the Guru applies the
        healing ointment of spiritual wisdom to the eyes. In the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have escaped from these troubles;
        Nanak loves the One Lord.  || 4 || 9 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  I carry the water, wave the fan, and grind the corn for
        the Saints; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
        With each and every breath, my mind remembers the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord; in this way, it finds the treasure of peace.  ||
        1 ||   Have pity on me, O my Lord and Master. Bless me with such
        understanding, O my Lord and Master, that I may forever and ever
        meditate on You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By Your Grace, emotional
        attachment and egotism are eradicated, and doubt is dispelled.
        The Lord, the embodiment of bliss, is pervading and permeating
        in all; wherever I go, there I see Him.  || 2 ||   You are kind
        and compassionate, the treasure of mercy, the Purifier of sinners,
        Lord of the world. I obtain millions of joys, comforts and kingdoms,
        if You inspire me to chant Your Name with my mouth, even for an
        instant.  || 3 ||   That alone is perfect chanting, meditation,
        penance and devotional worship service, which is pleasing to God's
        Mind. Chanting the Naam, all thirst and desire is satisfied; Nanak
        is satisfied and fulfilled.  || 4 || 10 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  She controls the three qualities and the four directions
        of the world. She destroys sacrificial feasts, cleansing baths,
        penances and sacred places of pilgrimage; what is this poor person
        to do?  || 1 ||   I grasped God's Support and Protection,
        and then I was emancipated. By the Grace of the Holy Saints, I
        sang the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, and my sins and afflictions
        were taken away.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   She is not heard  - 
        she does not speak with a mouth; she is not seen enticing mortals.
        She administers her intoxicating drug, and so confuses them; thus
        she seems sweet to everyone's mind.  || 2 ||   In each and
        every home, she has implanted the sense of duality in mother,
        father, children, friends and siblings. Some have more, and some
        have less; they fight and fight, to the death.  || 3 ||   I am
        a sacrifice to my True Guru, who has shown me this wondrous play.
        The world is being consumed by this hidden fire, but Maya does
        not cling to the Lord's devotees.  || 4 ||   By the Grace
        of the Saints, I have obtained supreme bliss, and all my bonds
        have been broken. Nanak has obtained the wealth of the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har; having earned his profits, he has now returned
        home.  || 5 || 11 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You are the
        Giver, O Lord, O Cherisher, my Master, my Husband Lord. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Each and every moment, You cherish and nurture me; I am Your child,
        and I rely upon You alone.  || 1 ||   I have only one tongue  - 
        which of Your Glorious Virtues can I describe? Unlimited, infinite
        Lord and Master  -  no one knows Your limits.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   You destroy millions of my sins, and teach me in so many
        ways. I am so ignorant  -  I understand nothing at all. Please
        honor Your innate nature, and save me!  || 2 ||   I seek Your
        Sanctuary  -  You are my only hope. You are my companion, and
        my best friend. Save me, O Merciful Saviour Lord; Nanak is the
        slave of Your home.  || 3 || 12 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        Worship, fasting, ceremonial marks on one's forehead, cleansing
        baths, generous donations to charities and self-mortification
        -  the Lord Master is not pleased with any of these rituals,
        no matter how sweetly one may speak.  || 1 ||   Chanting the Name
        of God, the mind is soothed and pacified. Everyone searches for
        Him in different ways, but the search is so difficult, and He
        cannot be found.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Chanting, deep meditation
        and penance, wandering over the face of the earth, the performance
        of austerities with the arms stretched up to the sky  -  the
        Lord is not pleased by any of these means, though one may follow
        the path of Yogis and Jains.  || 2 ||   The Ambrosial Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, and the Praises of the Lord are priceless; he
        alone obtains them, whom the Lord blesses with His Mercy. Joining
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak lives in the
        Love of God; his life-night passes in peace.  || 3 || 13 ||  
        DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Is there anyone who can release me
        from my bondage, unite me with God, recite the Name of the Lord,
        Har, Har, and make this mind steady and stable, so that it no
        longer wanders around?  || 1 ||   Do I have any such friend? I
        would give him all my property, my soul and my heart; I would
        devote my consciousness to him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Others'
        wealth, others' bodies, and the slander of others  - 
        do not attach your love to them. Associate with the Saints, speak
        with the Saints, and keep your mind awake to the Kirtan of the
        Lord's Praises.  || 2 ||   God is the treasure of virtue,
        kind and compassionate, the source of all comfort. Nanak begs
        for the gift of Your Name; O Lord of the world, love him, like
        the mother loves her child.  || 3 || 14 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The Lord saves His Saints. One who wishes misfortune upon
        the Lord's slaves, shall be destroyed by the Lord eventually.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He Himself is the help and support of His
        humble servants; He defeats the slanderers, and chases them away.
        Wandering around aimlessly, they die out there; they never return
        to their homes again.  || 1 ||   Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of
        the Destroyer of pain; he sings the Glorious Praises of the infinite
        Lord forever. The faces of the slanderers are blackened in the
        courts of this world, and the world beyond.  || 2 || 15 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Now, I contemplate and meditate on the Lord, the
        Saviour Lord. He purifies sinners in an instant, and cures all
        diseases.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Talking with the Holy Saints,
        my sexual desire, anger and greed have been eradicated. </p>

      <p> Remembering, remembering the Perfect Lord in meditation, I have
        saved all my companions.  || 1 ||   The Mul Mantra, the Root Mantra,
        is the only cure for the mind; I have installed faith in God in
        my mind. Nanak ever longs for the dust of the Lord's feet;
        again and again, he is a sacrifice to the Lord.  || 2 || 16 ||
        DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have fallen in love with the Lord.
        My True Guru is always my help and support; He has torn down the
        banner of pain.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Giving me His hand, He has
        protected me as His own, and removed all my troubles. He has blackened
        the faces of the slanderers, and He Himself has become the help
        and support of His humble servant.  || 1 ||   The True Lord and
        Master has become my Saviour; hugging me close in His embrace,
        He has saved me. Nanak has become fearless, and he enjoys eternal
        peace, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 2 || 17 ||
        DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Your Name is the medicine, O Merciful
        Lord. I am so miserable, I do not know Your state; You Yourself
        cherish me, Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Take pity on me, O my
        Lord and Master, and remove the love of duality from within me.
        Break my bonds, and take me as Your own, so that I may never come
        to lose.  || 1 ||   Seeking Your Sanctuary, I live, almighty and
        merciful Lord and Master. Twenty-four hours a day, I worship God;
        Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him.  || 2 || 18 || </p>

      <p> O God, please save me! By myself, I cannot do anything, O my Lord
        and Master; by Your Grace, please bless me with Your Name.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Family and worldly affairs are an ocean of fire.
        Through doubt, emotional attachment and ignorance, we are enveloped
        in darkness.  || 1 ||   High and low, pleasure and pain. Hunger
        and thirst are not satisfied.  || 2 ||   The mind is engrossed
        in passion, and the disease of corruption. The five thieves, the
        companions, are totally incorrigible.  || 3 ||   The beings and
        souls and wealth of the world are all Yours. O Nanak, know that
        the Lord is always near at hand.  || 4 || 1 || 19 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord and Master destroys the pain of the poor;
        He preserves and protects the honor of His servants. The Lord
        is the ship to carry us across; He is the treasure of virtue  - 
        pain cannot touch Him.  || 1 ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord of the world. I cannot
        think of any other way; make this effort, and make it in this
        Dark Age of Kali Yuga.  ||  Pause  ||   In the beginning, and
        in the end, there is none other than the perfect, merciful Lord.
        The cycle of birth and death is ended, chanting the Lord's
        Name, and remembering the Lord Master in meditation.  || 2 ||
        The Vedas, the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Lord's
        devotees contemplate Him; liberation is attained in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and the darkness of ignorance
        is dispelled.  || 3 ||   The lotus feet of the Lord are the support

        around, I met the Holy Perfect Guru, who has taught me. All other
        devices did not work, so I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har.  || 1 ||   For this reason, I sought the Protection and Support
        of my Lord, the Cherisher of the Universe. I sought the Sanctuary

        dissolved.  ||  Pause  ||   Paradise, the earth, the nether regions
        of the underworld, and the globe of the world  -  all are engrossed
        in Maya. To save your soul, and liberate all your ancestors, meditate
        on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 2 ||   O Nanak, singing
        the Naam, the Name of the Immaculate Lord, all treasures are obtained.

        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> You shall have to abandon the straw which you have collected.
        These entanglements shall be of no use to you. You are in love
        with those things that will not go with you. You think that your
        enemies are friends.  || 1 ||   In such confusion, the world has
        gone astray. The foolish mortal wastes this precious human life.
        ||  Pause  ||   He does not like to see Truth and righteousness.
        He is attached to falsehood and deception; they seem sweet to
        him. He loves gifts, but he forgets the Giver. The wretched creature
        does not even think of death.  || 2 ||   He cries for the possessions
        of others. He forfeits all the merits of his good deeds and religion.
        He does not understand the Hukam of the Lord's Command, and
        so he continues coming and going in reincarnation. He sins, and
        then regrets and repents.  || 3 ||   Whatever pleases You, Lord,
        that alone is acceptable. I am a sacrifice to Your Will. Poor
        Nanak is Your slave, Your humble servant. Save me, O my Lord God
        Master!  || 4 || 1 || 22 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I am
        meek and poor; the Name of God is my only Support. The Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, is my occupation and earnings. I gather only
        the Lord's Name. It is useful in both this world and the
        next.  || 1 ||   Imbued with the Love of the Lord God's Infinite
        Name, the Holy Saints sing the Glorious Praises of the One Lord,
        the Formless Lord.  || Pause  ||   The Glory of the Holy Saints
        comes from their total humility. The Saints realize that their
        greatness rests in the Praises of the Lord. Meditating on the
        Lord of the Universe, the Saints are in bliss. The Saints find
        peace, and their anxieties are dispelled.  || 2 ||   Wherever
        the Holy Saints gather, there they sing the Praises of the Lord,
        in music and poetry. In the Society of the Saints, there is bliss
        and peace. They alone obtain this Society, upon whose foreheads
        such destiny is written.  || 3 ||   With my palms pressed together,
        I offer my prayer. I wash their feet, and chant the Praises of
        the Lord, the treasure of virtue. O God, merciful and compassionate,
        let me remain in Your Presence. Nanak lives, in the dust of the
        Saints.  || </p>

        self-willed manmukhs are ruined through fear and dread.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The Divine Guru, my mother and father, is over
        my head. His image brings prosperity; serving Him, we become pure.
        The One Lord, the Immaculate Lord, is our capital. Joining the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, we are illumined and enlightened.
        || 1 ||   The Giver of all beings is totally pervading everywhere.
        Millions of pains are removed by the Lord's Name. All the
        pains of birth and death are taken away from the Gurmukh, within
        whose mind and body the Lord dwells.  || 2 ||   He alone, whom
        the Lord has attached to the hem of His robe, obtains a place
        in the Court of the Lord. They alone are devotees, who are pleasing
        to the True Lord. They are freed from the Messenger of Death.
        || 3 ||   True is the Lord, and True is His Court. Who can contemplate
        and describe His value? He is within each and every heart, the
        Support of all. Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints.  || 4 ||

        is the strength of His humble servants. Whatever You do, or cause
        to be done, O Lord and Master, that outcome is acceptable to me.
        ||  Pause  ||   The Transcendent Lord is my honor; the Lord is
        my emancipation; the glorious sermon of the Lord is my wealth.
        Slave Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's feet; from

        it impassible.  || 1 ||   Those who have true faith in their minds,
        continually behold the Glory of the Lord; they are forever happy
        and blissful.  ||  Pause  ||   I seek the Sanctuary of the feet

        Him ever-present. In His wisdom, the Lord has made Nanak His own;
        He has preserved the roots of His devotees.  || 2 || 2 || 26 ||

        your companion, who will not be separated from you, here or hereafter.
        That pleasure, which passes away in an instant, is trivial.  ||
        Pause  ||   He cherishes us, and gives us sustenance; He does
        not lack anything. With each and every breath, my God takes care
        of His creatures.  || 2 ||   God is undeceiveable, impenetrable
        and infinite; His form is lofty and exalted. Chanting and meditating
        on the embodiment of wonder and beauty, His humble servants are
        in bliss.  || 3 || </p>

        Glorious Praises; by this celestial tune, you shall acquire your
        everlasting kingdom.  || 1 ||   Come back to your home, O my friend.
        The Lord Himself has eliminated your enemies, and your misfortunes
        are past.  ||  Pause  ||   God, the Creator Lord, has glorified
        you, and your running and rushing around has ended. In your home,
        there is rejoicing; the musical instruments continually play,
        and your Husband Lord has exalted you.  || 2 ||   Remain firm
        and steady, and do not ever waver; take the Guru's Word as
        your Support. You shall be applauded and congratulated all over

      <p> Listen, O Dear Beloved Saints, to my prayer. Without the Lord,
        no one is liberated.  ||  Pause  ||   O mind, do only deeds of
        purity; the Lord is the only boat to carry you across. Other entanglements
        shall be of no use to you. True living is serving the Divine,
        Supreme Lord God; the Guru has imparted this teaching to me. 
        || 1 ||   Do not fall in love with trivial things; in the end,
        they shall not go along with you. Worship and adore the Lord with
        your mind and body, O Beloved Saint of the Lord; in the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall be released from bondage.
        || 2 ||   In your heart, hold fast to the Sanctuary of the lotus
        feet of the Supreme Lord God; do not place your hopes in any other
        support. He alone is a devotee, spiritually wise, a meditator,
        and a penitent, O Nanak, who is blessed by the Lord's Mercy.
        || 3 || 1 || 29 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  O my dear beloved,
        it is good, it is better, it is best, to ask for the Lord's
        Name. Behold, with your eyes wide-open, and listen to the Words
        of the Holy Saints; enshrine in your consciousness the Lord of
        Life  -  remember that all must die.  ||  Pause  ||   The application
        of sandalwood oil, the enjoyment of pleasures and the practice
        of many corrupt sins  -  look upon all of these as insipid
        and worthless. The Name of the Lord of the Universe alone is sublime;
        so say the Holy Saints. You claim that your body and wealth are
        your own; you do not chant the Lord's Name even for an instant.
        Look and see, that none of your possessions or riches shall go
        along with you.  || 1 ||   One who has good karma, grasps the
        Protection of the hem of the Saint's robe; in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, the Messenger of Death cannot threaten
        him. I have obtained the supreme treasure, and my egotism has
        been eradicated; Nanak's mind is attached to the One Formless

        wherever I go, He protects me.  || 1 ||   The Guru's Word
        abides with my soul. It does not sink in water; thieves cannot
        steal it, and fire cannot burn it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   It is
        like wealth to the poor, a cane for the blind, and mother's
        milk for the infant. In the ocean of the world, I have found the
        boat of the Lord; the Merciful Lord has bestowed His Mercy upon
        Nanak.  || 2 || 1 || 32 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord
        of the Universe has become kind and merciful; His Ambrosial Nectar
        permeates my heart. The nine treasures, riches and the miraculous
        spiritual powers of the Siddhas cling to the feet of the Lord's
        humble servant.  || 1 ||   The Saints are in ecstasy everywhere.
        Within the home, and outside as well, the Lord and Master of His
        devotees is totally pervading and permeating everywhere.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   No one can equal one who has the Lord of the Universe
        on his side. The fear of the Messenger of Death is eradicated,
        remembering Him in meditation; Nanak meditates on the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord.  || 2 || 2 || 33 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:
        The rich man gazes upon his riches, and is proud of himself;
        the landlord takes pride in his lands. The king believes that
        the whole kingdom belongs to him; in the same way, the humble
        servant of the Lord looks upon the support of his Lord and Master.
        || 1 ||   When one considers the Lord to be his only support,
        then the Lord uses His power to help him; this power cannot be
        defeated.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Renouncing all others, I have
        sought the Support of the One Lord; I have come to Him, pleading,
  &quot;Save me, save me!&quot; By the kindness and the Grace of
        the Saints, my mind has been purified; Nanak sings the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord.  || 2 || 3 || 34 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH

        my heart; with them, my body is made pure. O treasure of mercy,

        this alone brings peace.  || 2 || 4 || 35 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  People try to deceive others, but the Inner-knower, the
        Searcher of hearts, knows everything. They commit sins, and then
        deny them, while they pretend to be in Nirvaanaa.  || 1 ||   They
        believe that You are far away, but You, O God, are near at hand.
        Looking around, this way and that, the greedy people come and
        go.  ||  Pause  ||   As long as the doubts of the mind are not
        removed, liberation is not found. Says Nanak, he alone is a Saint,
        a devotee, and a humble servant of the Lord, to whom the Lord
        and Master is merciful.  || 2 || 5 || 36 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  My Guru gives the Naam, the Name of the Lord, to those
        who have such karma written on their foreheads. He implants the
        Naam, and inspires us to chant the Naam; this is Dharma, true
        religion, in this world.  || 1 ||   The Naam is the glory and
        greatness of the Lord's humble servant. The Naam is his salvation,
        and the Naam is his honor; he accepts whatever comes to pass.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That humble servant, who has the Naam as
        his wealth, is the perfect banker. The Naam is his occupation,
        O Nanak, and his only support; the Naam is the profit he earns.
        || 2 || 6 || 37 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  My eyes have
        been purified, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's
        Darshan, and touching my forehead to the dust of His feet. With
        joy and happiness, I sing the Glorious Praises of my Lord and
        Master; the Lord of the World abides within my heart.  || 1 ||
        You are my Merciful Protector, Lord. O beautiful, wise, infinite
        Father God, be Merciful to me, God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Lord
        of supreme ecstasy and blissful form, Your Word is so beautiful,
        so drenched with Nectar. With the Lord's lotus feet enshrined
        in his heart, Nanak has tied the Shabad, the Word of the True
        Guru, to the hem of his robe.  || 2 || 7 || 38 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  In His own way, He provides us with our food; in
        His own way, He plays with us. He blesses us with all comforts,
        enjoyments and delicacies, and he permeates our minds.  || 1 ||
        Our Father is the Lord of the World, the Merciful Lord. Just
        as the mother protects her children, God nurtures and cares for
        us.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are my friend and companion, the
        Master of all excellences, O eternal and permanent Divine Lord.
        Here, there and everywhere, You are pervading; please, bless Nanak
        to serve the Saints.  || 2 || 8 || 39 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The Saints are kind and compassionate; they burn away their
        sexual desire, anger and corruption. My power, wealth, youth,
        body and soul are a sacrifice to them.  || 1 ||   With my mind
        and body, I love the Lord's Name. With peace, poise, pleasure
        and joy, He has carried me across the terrifying world-ocean.

        that he may bow in reverence to Your devotees.  || 2 || 9 || 40
        ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  He has saved me from the awful
        power of Maya, by attaching me to His feet. He gave my mind the
        Mantra of the Naam, the Name of the One Lord, which shall never
        perish or leave me.  || 1 ||   The Perfect True Guru has given
        this gift. He has blessed me with the Kirtan of the Praises of
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and I am emancipated.  ||  Pause
        ||   My God has made me His own, and saved the honor of His devotee.
        Nanak has grasped the feet of his God, and has found peace, day
        and night.  || 2 || 10 || 41 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Stealing
        the property of others, acting in greed, lying and slandering
        -  in these ways, he passes his life. He places his hopes
        in false mirages, believing them to be sweet; this is the support
        he installs in his mind.  || 1 ||   The faithless cynic passes
        his life uselessly. He is like the mouse, gnawing away at the
        pile of paper, making it useless to the poor wretch.  ||  Pause
        ||   Have mercy on me, O Supreme Lord God, and release me from
        these bonds. The blind are sinking, O Nanak; God saves them, uniting
        them with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 2 ||
        11 || 42 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Remembering, remembering
        God, the Lord Master in meditation, my body, mind and heart are
        cooled and soothed. The Supreme Lord God is my beauty, pleasure,
        peace, wealth, soul and social status.  || 1 ||   My tongue is
        intoxicated with the Lord, the source of nectar. I am in love,
        in love with the Lord's lotus feet, the treasure of riches.
        ||  Pause  ||   I am His  -  He has saved me; this is God's
        perfect way. The Giver of peace has blended Nanak with Himself;
        the Lord has preserved his honor.  || 2 || 12 || 43 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  All demons and enemies are eradicated by You, Lord;
        Your glory is manifest and radiant. Whoever harms Your devotees,
        You destroy in an instant.  || 1 ||   I look to You continually,
        Lord. O Lord, Destroyer of ego, please, be the helper and companion
        of Your slaves; take my hand, and save me, O my Friend!  ||  Pause
        ||   My Lord and Master has heard my prayer, and given me His
        protection. Nanak is in ecstasy, and his pains are gone; he meditates
        on the Lord, forever and ever.  || 2 || 13 || 44 ||   DHANAASAREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  He has extended His power in all four directions,
        and placed His hand upon my head. Gazing upon me with his Eye
        of Mercy, He has dispelled the pains of His slave.  || 1 ||  
        The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, has saved the Lord's
        humble servant. Hugging me close in His embrace, the merciful,
        forgiving Lord has erased all my sins.  ||  Pause  ||   Whatever
        I ask for from my Lord and Master, he gives that to me. Whatever
        the Lord's slave Nanak utters with his mouth, proves to be
        true, here and hereafter.  || 2 || 14 || 45 || <br>
