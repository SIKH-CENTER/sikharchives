      <p> RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  What supports you in this world? You
        ignorant fool, who is your companion? The Lord is your only companion;
        no one knows His condition. You look upon the five thieves as
        your friends.  || 1 ||   Serve that home, which will save you,
        my friend. Chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe,
        day and night; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, love
        Him in your mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   This human life is passing
        away in egotism and conflict. You are not satisfied; such is the
        flavor of sin. Wandering and roaming around, you suffer terrible
        pain. You cannot cross over the impassable sea of Maya.  || 2
        ||   You do the deeds which do not help you at all. As you plant,
        so shall you harvest. There is none other than the Lord to save
        you. You will be saved, only if God grants His Grace.  || 3 ||
        Your Name, God, is the Purifier of sinners. Please bless Your
        slave with that gift. Please grant Your Grace, God, and emancipate
        me. Nanak has grasped Your Sanctuary, God.  || 4 || 37 || 48 ||
        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have found peace in this world. I
        will not have to appear before the Righteous Judge of Dharma to
        give my account. I will be respected in the Court of the Lord,
        and I will not have to enter the womb of reincarnation ever again.
        || 1 ||   Now, I know the value of friendship with the Saints.
        In His Mercy, the Lord has blessed me with His Name. My pre-ordained
        destiny has been fulfilled.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My consciousness
        is attached to the Guru's feet. Blessed, blessed is this
        fortunate time of union. I have applied the dust of the Saints'
        feet to my forehead, and all my sinful residues and pains have
        been eradicated.  || 2 ||   Performing true service to the Holy,
        the mortal's mind is purified. I have seen the fruitful
        vision of the Lord's humble slave. God's Name dwells
        within each and every heart.  || 3 ||   All my troubles and sufferings
        have been taken away; I have merged into the One, from whom I
        originated. The Lord of the Universe, incomparably beautiful,
        has become merciful. O Nanak, God is perfect and forgiving.  ||
        4 || 38 || 49 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The tiger leads the
        cow to the pasture, the shell is worth thousands of dollars, and
        the elephant nurses the goat, when God bestows His Glance of Grace.
        || 1 ||   You are the treasure of mercy, O my Beloved Lord God.
        I cannot even describe Your many Glorious Virtues.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The cat sees the meat, but does not eat it, and the great
        butcher throws away his knife; the Creator Lord God abides in
        the heart; the net holding the fish breaks apart.  || 2 ||   The
        dry wood blossoms forth in greenery and red flowers; in the high
        desert, the beautiful lotus flower blooms. The Divine True Guru
        puts out the fire. He links His servant to His service.  || 3
        ||   He saves even the ungrateful; my God is forever merciful.
        He is forever the helper and support of the humble Saints. Nanak
        has found the Sanctuary of His lotus feet.  || 4 || 39 || 50 ||

      <p> God killed the five tigers. He has driven out the ten wolves.
        The three whirl-pools have stopped spinning. In the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, the fear of reincarnation is gone.  ||
        1 ||   Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord of the
        Universe, I live. In His Mercy, He protects His slave; the True
        Lord is forever and ever the forgiver.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The
        mountain of sin is burnt down, like straw, by chanting and meditating
        on the Name, and worshipping God's feet. God, the embodiment
        of bliss, becomes manifest everywhere. Linked to His loving devotional
        worship, I enjoy peace.  || 2 ||   I have crossed over the world-ocean,
        as if it were no bigger than a calf's footprint on the
        ground. I shall never again have to endure suffering or grief.
        The ocean is contained in the pitcher. This is not such an amazing
        thing for the Creator to do.  || 3 ||   When I am separated from
        Him, then I am consigned to the nether regions. When He lifts
        me up and pulls me out, then I am enraptured by His Glance of
        Grace. Vice and virtue are not under my control. With love and
        affection, Nanak sings His Glorious Praises.  || 4 || 40 || 51
        ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Neither your body nor your mind
        belong to you. Attached to Maya, you are entangled in fraud. You
        play like a baby lamb. But suddenly, Death will catch you in its
        noose.  || 1 ||   Seek the Sanctuary of the Lord's lotus
        feet, O my mind. Chant the Name of the Lord, which will be your
        help and support. As Gurmukh, you shall obtain the true wealth.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your unfinished worldly affairs will never
        be resolved. You shall always regret your sexual desire, anger
        and pride. You act in corruption in order to survive, but not
        even an iota will go along with you, you ignorant fool!  || 2
        ||   You practice deception, and you know many tricks; for the
        sake of mere shells, you throw dust upon your head. You never
        even think of the One who gave you life. The pain of false greed
        never leaves you.  || 3 ||   When the Supreme Lord God becomes
        merciful, this mind becomes the dust of the feet of the Holy.
        With His lotus hands, He has attached us to the hem of His robe.
        Nanak merges in the Truest of the True.  || 4 || 41 || 52 || 
        RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I seek the Sanctuary of the Sovereign
        Lord. I have become fearless, singing the Glorious Praises of
        the Lord of the Universe. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, my pains have been taken away.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        That person, within whose mind the Lord abides, does not see
        the impassible world-ocean. All one's affairs are resolved,
        by chanting continually the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1
        ||   Why should His slave feel any anxiety? The Guru places His
        hand upon my forehead. The fear of birth and death is dispelled;
        I am a sacrifice to the Perfect Guru.  || 2 ||   I am enraptured,
        meeting with the Guru, the Transcendent Lord. He alone obtains
        the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, who is blessed
        by His Mercy. One who is blessed by the Grace of the Supreme Lord
        God, crosses over the terrifying world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy.  || 3 ||   Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar,
        O Beloved Holy people. Your face shall be radiant and bright in
        the Court of the Lord. Celebrate and be blissful, and abandon
        all corruption. O Nanak, meditate on the Lord and cross over.

      <p> RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The fire runs away from the fuel. The
        water runs away from the dust in all directions. The feet are
        above, and the sky is beneath. The ocean appears in the cup. 
        || 1 ||   Such is our all-powerful dear Lord. His devotees do
        not forget Him, even for an instant. Twenty-four hours a day,
        O mind, meditate on Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   First comes the
        butter, and then the milk. The dirt cleans the soap. The fearless
        are afraid of fear. The living are killed by the dead.  || 2 ||
        The visible body is hidden, and the etheric body is seen. The
        Lord of the world does all these things. The one who is cheated,
        is not cheated by the cheat. With no merchandise, the trader trades
        again and again.  || 3 ||   So join the Society of the Saints,
        and chant the Lord's Name. So say the Simritees, Shaastras,
        Vedas and Puraanas. Rare are those who contemplate and meditate
        on God. O Nanak, they attain the supreme status.  || 4 || 43 ||
        54 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Whatever pleases Him happens.
        Forever and ever, I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord. There is none
        other than God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You look upon your children,
        spouse and wealth; none of these will go along with you. Eating
        the poisonous potion, you have gone astray. You will have to go,
        and leave Maya and your mansions.  || 1 ||   Slandering others,
        you are totally ruined; because of your past actions, you shall
        be consigned to the womb of reincarnation. Your past actions will
        not just go away; the most horrible Messenger of Death shall seize
        you.  || 2 ||   You tell lies, and do not practice what you preach.
        Your desires are not satisfied - what a shame. You have
        contracted an incurable disease; slandering the Saints, your body
        is wasting away; you are utterly ruined.  || 3 ||   He embellishes
        those whom He has fashioned. He Himself gave life to the Saints.
        O Nanak, He hugs His slaves close in His Embrace. Please grant
        Your Grace, O Supreme Lord God, and be kind to me as well.  ||
        4 || 44 || 55 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Such is the Perfect
        Divine Guru, my help and support. Meditation on Him is not wasted.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan,
        I am enraptured. The dust of His feet snaps the noose of Death.
        His lotus feet dwell within my mind, and so all the affairs of
        my body are arranged and resolved.  || 1 ||   One upon whom He
        places His Hand, is protected. My God is the Master of the masterless.
        He is the Savior of sinners, the treasure of mercy. Forever and
        ever, I am a sacrifice to Him.  || 2 ||   One whom He blesses
        with His Immaculate Mantra, renounces corruption; his egotistical
        pride is dispelled. Meditate on the One Lord in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. Sins are erased, through the love of
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 3 ||   The Guru, the Transcendent
        Lord, dwells among all. The treasure of virtue pervades and permeates
        each and every heart. Please grant me the Blessed Vision of Your
        Darshan; O God, I place my hopes in You. Nanak continually offers
        this true prayer.  || 4 || 45 || 56 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">The same moon rises, and the same stars; the
        same sun shines in the sky. The earth is the same, and the same
        wind blows. The age in which we dwell affects living beings, but
        not these places.  || 1 ||   Give up your attachment to life.
        Those who act like tyrants are accepted and approved -
        recognize that this is the sign of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Kali Yuga has not been heard to have come
        to any country, or to be sitting at any sacred shrine. It is not
        where the generous person gives to charities, nor seated in the
        mansion he has built.  || 2 ||   If someone practices Truth, he
        is frustrated; prosperity does not come to the home of the sincere.
        If someone chants the Lord's Name, he is scorned. These
        are the signs of Kali Yuga.  || 3 ||   Whoever is in charge, is
        humiliated. Why should the servant be afraid, when the master
        is put in chains? He dies at the hands of his servant. <br>

      <p> || 4 ||   Chant the Praises of the Lord; Kali Yuga has come. The
        justice of the previous three ages is gone. One obtains virtue,
        only if the Lord bestows it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In this turbulent
        age of Kali Yuga, Muslim law decides the cases, and the blue-robed
        Qazi is the judge. The Guru's Bani has taken the place
        of Brahma's Veda, and the singing of the Lord's
        Praises are good deeds.  || 5 ||   Worship without faith; self-discipline
        without truthfulness; the ritual of the sacred thread without
        chastity - what good are these? You may bathe and wash,
        and apply a ritualistic tilak mark to your forehead, but without
        inner purity, there is no understanding.  || 6 ||   In Kali Yuga,
        the Koran and the Bible have become famous. The Pandit's
        scriptures and the Puraanas are not respected. O Nanak, the Lord's
        Name now is Rehmaan, the Merciful. Know that there is only One
        Creator of the creation.  || 7 ||   Nanak has obtained the glorious
        greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. There is no action
        higher than this. If someone goes out to beg for what is already
        in his own home, then he should be chastised.  || 8 || 1 ||  
        RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:  You preach to the world, and set up your
        house. Abandoning your Yogic postures, how will you find the True
        Lord? You are attached to possessiveness and the love of sexual
        pleasure. You are not a renunciate, nor a man of the world.  ||
        1 ||   Yogi, remain seated, and the pain of duality will run away
        from you. You beg from door to door, and you don't feel
        ashamed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You sing the songs, but you do
        not understand your own self. How will the burning pain within
        be relieved? Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, let
        your mind be absorbed in the Lord's Love, and you will
        intuitively experience the charity of contemplation.  || 2 ||
        You apply ashes to your body, while acting in hypocrisy. Attached
        to Maya, you will be beaten by Death's heavy club. Your
        begging bowl is broken; it will not hold the charity of the Lord's
        Love. Bound in bondage, you come and go.  || 3 ||   You do not
        control your seed and semen, and yet you claim to practice abstinence.
        You beg from Maya, lured by the three qualities. You have no compassion;
        the Lord's Light does not shine in you. You are drowned,
        drowned in worldly entanglements.  || 4 ||   You wear religious
        robes, and your patched coat assumes many disguises. You play
        all sorts of false tricks, like a juggler. The fire of anxiety
        burns brightly within you. Without the karma of good actions,
        how can you cross over?  || 5 ||   You make ear-rings of glass
        to wear in your ears. But liberation does not come from learning
        without understanding. You are lured by the tastes of the tongue
        and sex organs. You have become a beast; this sign cannot be erased.
        || 6 ||   The people of the world are entangled in the three
        modes; the Yogis are entangled in the three modes. Contemplating
        the Word of the Shabad, sorrows are dispelled. Through the Shabad,
        one becomes radiant, pure and truthful. One who contemplates the
        true lifestyle is a Yogi.  || 7 ||   The nine treasures are with
        You, Lord; You are potent, the Cause of causes. You establish
        and disestablish; whatever You do, happens. One who practices
        celibacy, chastity, self-control, truth and pure consciousness
        - O Nanak, that Yogi is the friend of the three worlds.
        || 8 || 2 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Above the six chakras
        of the body dwells the detached mind. Awareness of the vibration
        of the Word of the Shabad has been awakened deep within. The unstruck
        melody of the sound current resonates and resounds within; my
        mind is attuned to it. Through the Guru's Teachings, my
        faith is confirmed in the True Name.  || 1 ||   O mortal, through
        devotion to the Lord, peace is obtained. <br>

      <p> The Lord, Har, Har, seems sweet to the Gurmukh, who merges in
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Eradicating
        attachment to Maya, one merges into the Lord. Meeting with the
        True Guru, we unite in His Union. The Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        is a priceless jewel, a diamond. Attuned to it, the mind is comforted
        and encouraged.  || 2 ||   The diseases of egotism and possessiveness
        do not afflict one who worships the Lord. Fear of the Messenger
        of Death runs away. The Messenger of Death, the enemy of the soul,
        does not touch me at all. The Immaculate Name of the Lord illuminates
        my heart.  || 3 ||   Contemplating the Shabad, we become Nirankaari
        - we come to belong to the Formless Lord God. Awakening
        to the Guru's Teachings, evil-mindedness is taken away.
        Remaining awake and aware night and day, lovingly focused on the
        Lord, one becomes Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive.
        He finds this state deep within himself.  || 4 ||   In the secluded
        cave, I remain unattached. With the Word of the Shabad, I have
        killed the five thieves. My mind does not waver or go to the home
        of any other. I remain intuitively absorbed deep within.  || 5
        ||   As Gurmukh, I remain awake and aware, unattached. Forever
        detached, I am woven into the essence of reality. The world is
        asleep; it dies, and comes and goes in reincarnation. Without
        the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it does not understand.
        || 6 ||   The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates day
        and night. The Gurmukh knows the state of the eternal, unchanging
        Lord God. When someone realizes the Shabad, then he truly knows.
        The One Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere in Nirvaanaa.
        || 7 ||   My mind is intuitively absorbed in the state of deepest
        Samaadhi; renouncing egotism and greed, I have come to know the
        One Lord. When the disciple's mind accepts the Guru, O
        Nanak, duality is eradicated, and he merges in the Lord.  || 8
        || 3 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:  You calculate the auspicious
        days, but  you do not understand that the One Creator Lord is
        above these auspicious days. He alone knows the way, who meets
        the Guru. When one follows the Guru's Teachings, then he
        realizes the Hukam of God's Command.  || 1 ||   Do not
        tell lies, O Pandit; O religious scholar, speak the Truth. When
        egotism is eradicated through the Word of the Shabad, then one
        finds His home.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Calculating and counting,
        the astrologer draws the horoscope. He studies it and announces
        it, but he does not understand reality. Understand, that the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad is above all. Do not speak of anything
        else; it is all just ashes.  || 2 ||   You bathe, wash, and worship
        stones. But without being imbued with the Lord, you are the filthiest
        of the filthy. Subduing your pride, you shall receive the supreme
        wealth of God. The mortal is liberated and emancipated, meditating
        on the Lord.  || 3 ||   You study the arguments, but do not contemplate
        the Vedas. You drown yourself - how will you save your
        ancestors? How rare is that person who realizes that God is in
        each and every heart. When one meets the True Guru, then he understands.
        || 4 ||   Making his calculations, cynicism and suffering afflict
        his soul. Seeking the Sanctuary of the Guru, peace is found. I
        sinned and made mistakes, but now I seek Your Sanctuary. The Guru
        led me to meet the Lord, according to my past actions.  || 5 ||
        If one does not enter the Guru's Sanctuary, God cannot
        be found. Deluded by doubt, one is born, only to die, and come
        back again. Dying in corruption, he is bound and gagged at Death's
        door. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is not in his heart, and
        he does not act according to the Shabad.  || 6 ||   Some call
        themselves Pandits, religious scholars and spiritual teachers. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Tinged with double-mindedness, they do not find the Mansion of
        the Lord's Presence. One who takes the Support of the Naam,
        by Guru's Grace, is a rare person, one among millions,
        incomparable.  || 7 ||   One is bad, and another good, but the
        One True Lord is contained in all. Understand this, O spiritual
        teacher, through the support of the True Guru: rare indeed is
        that Gurmukh, who realizes the One Lord. His comings and goings
        cease, and he merges in the Lord.  || 8 ||   Those who have the
        One Universal Creator Lord within their hearts, possess all virtues;
        they contemplate the True Lord. One who acts in harmony with the
        Guru's Will, O Nanak, is absorbed in the Truest of the
        True.  || 9 || 4 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:  Practicing restraint
        by Hatha Yoga, the body wears away. The mind is not softened by
        fasting or austerities. Nothing else is equal to worship of the
        Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   Serve the Guru, O mind, and associate
        with the humble servants of the Lord. The tyrannical Messenger
        of Death cannot touch you, and the serpent of Maya cannot sting
        you, when you drink in the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   The world reads the arguments, and is softened
        only by music. In the three modes and corruption, they are born
        and die. Without the Lord's Name, they endure suffering
        and pain.  || 2 ||   The Yogi draws the breath upwards, and opens
        the Tenth Gate. He practices inner cleansing and the six rituals
        of purification. But without the Lord's Name, the breath
        he draws is useless.  || 3 ||   The fire of the five passions
        burns within him; how can he be calm? The thief is within him;
        how can he taste the taste? One who becomes Gurmukh conquers the
        body-fortress.  || 4 ||   With filth within, he wanders around
        at places of pilgrimage. His mind is not pure, so what is the
        use of performing ritual cleansings? He carries the karma of his
        own past actions; who else can he blame?  || 5 ||   He does not
        eat food; he tortures his body. Without the Guru's wisdom,
        he is not satisfied. The self-willed manmukh is born only to die,
        and be born again.  || 6 ||   Go, and ask the True Guru, and associate
        with the Lord's humble servants. Your mind shall merge
        into the Lord, and you shall not be reincarnated to die again.
        Without the Lord's Name, what can anyone do?  || 7 || 
        Silence the mouse scurrying around within you. Serve the Primal
        Lord, by chanting the Lord's Name. O Nanak, God blesses
        us with His Name, when He grants His Grace.  || 8 || 5 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIRST MEHL:  The created Universe emanated from within You; there
        is no other at all. Whatever is said to be, is from You, O God.
        He is the True Lord and Master, throughout the ages. Creation
        and destruction do not come from anyone else.  || 1 ||   Such
        is my Lord and Master, profound and unfathomable. Whoever meditates
        on Him, finds peace. The arrow of the Messenger of Death does
        not strike one who has the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause 
        ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a priceless jewel, a diamond.
        The True Lord Master is immortal and immeasurable. That tongue
        which chants the True Name is pure. The True Lord is in the home
        of the self; there is no doubt about it.  || 2 ||   Some sit in
        the forests, and some make their home in the mountains. Forgetting
        the Naam, they rot away in egotistical pride. Without the Naam,
        what is the use of spiritual wisdom and meditation? The Gurmukhs
        are honored in the Court of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Acting stubbornly
        in egotism, one does not find the Lord. <br>

      <p> Studying the scriptures, reading them to other people, and wandering
        around at places of pilgrimage, the disease is not taken away.
        Without the Naam, how can one find peace?  || 4 ||   No matter
        how much he tries, he cannot control his semen and seed. His mind
        wavers, and he falls into hell. Bound and gagged in the City of
        Death, he is tortured. Without the Name, his soul cries out in
        agony.  || 5 ||   The many Siddhas and seekers, silent sages and
        demi-gods cannot satisfy themselves by practicing restraint through
        Hatha Yoga. One who contemplates the Word of the Shabad, and serves
        the Guru - his mind and body become immaculate, and his
        egotistical pride is obliterated.  || 6 ||   Blessed with Your
        Grace, I obtain the True Name. I remain in Your Sanctuary, in
        loving devotion. Love for Your devotional worship has welled up
        within me. As Gurmukh, I chant and meditate on the Lord's
        Name.  || 7 ||   When one is rid of egotism and pride, his mind
        is drenched in the Lord's Love. Practicing fraud and hypocrisy,
        he does not find God. Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        he cannot find the Lord's Door. O Nanak, the Gurmukh contemplates
        the essence of reality.  || 8 || 6 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIRST MEHL:
        As you come, so will you leave, you fool; as you were born, so
        will you die. As you enjoy pleasures, so will you suffer pain.
        Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you will fall into
        the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||   Gazing upon your body and
        wealth, you are so proud. Your love for gold and sexual pleasures
        increases; why have you forgotten the Naam, and why do you wander
        in doubt?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You do not practice truth, abstinence,
        self-discipline or humility; the ghost within your skeleton has
        turned to dry wood. You have not practiced charity, donations,
        cleansing baths or austerities. Without the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, your life has gone in vain.  || 2 ||   Attached
        to greed, you have forgotten the Naam. Coming and going, your
        life has been ruined. When the Messenger of Death grabs you by
        your hair, you will be punished. You are unconscious, and have
        fallen into Death's mouth.  || 3 ||   Day and night, you
        jealously slander others; in your heart, you have neither the
        Naam, nor compassion for all. Without the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, you will not find salvation or honor. Without the Lord's
        Name, you shall go to hell.  || 4 ||   In an instant, you change
        into various costumes, like a juggler; you are entangled in emotional
        attachment and sin. You gaze here and there upon the expanse of
        Maya; you are intoxicated with attachment to Maya.  || 5 ||  
        You act in corruption, and put on ostentatious shows, but without
        awareness of the Shabad, you have fallen into confusion. You suffer
        great pain from the disease of egotism. Following the Guru's
        Teachings, you shall be rid of this disease.  || 6 ||   Seeing
        peace and wealth come to him, the faithless cynic become proud
        in his mind. But He who owns this body and wealth, takes them
        back again, and then the mortal feels anxiety and pain deep within.
        || 7 ||   At the very last instant, nothing goes along with you;
        all is visible only by His Mercy. God is our Primal and Infinite
        Lord; enshrining the Lord's Name in the heart, one crosses
        over.  || 8 ||   You weep for the dead, but who hears you weeping?
        The dead have fallen to the serpent in the terrifying world-ocean. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Gazing upon his family, wealth, household and mansions, the faithless
        cynic is entangled in worthless worldly affairs.  || 9 ||   He
        comes when the Lord sends him; when the Lord calls him back, he
        goes. Whatever he does, the Lord is doing. The Forgiving Lord
        forgives him.  || 10 ||   I seek to be with those who have tasted
        this sublime essence of the Lord. Wealth, miraculous spiritual
        powers, wisdom and spiritual knowledge, are obtained from the
        Guru. The treasure of liberation is obtained in His Sanctuary.
        || 11 ||   The Gurmukh looks upon pain and pleasure as one and
        the same; he remains untouched by joy and sorrow. Conquering his
        self-conceit, the Gurmukh finds the Lord; O Nanak, he intuitively
        merges into the Lord.  || 12 || 7 ||   RAAMKALEE,  DAKHANEE, 
        FIRST MEHL:  Abstinence, chastity, self-control and truthfulness
        have been implanted within me; I am imbued with the sublime essence
        of the True Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||   My Merciful Guru remains
        forever imbued with the Lord's Love. Day and night, He
        remains lovingly focused on the One Lord; gazing upon the True
        Lord, He is pleased.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He abides in the Tenth
        Gate, and looks equally upon all; He is imbued with the unstruck
        sound current of the Shabad.  || 2 ||   Wearing the loin-cloth
        of chastity, He remains absorbed in the all-pervading Lord; His
        tongue enjoys the taste of God's Love.  || 3 ||   The One
        who created the creation has met the True Guru; contemplating
        the Guru's lifestyle, He is pleased.  || 4 ||   All are
        in the One, and the One is in all. This is what the True Guru
        has shown me.  || 5 ||   He who created the worlds, solar systems
        and galaxies - that God cannot be known.  || 6 ||   From
        the lamp of God, the lamp within is lit; the Divine Light illuminates
        the three worlds.  || 7 ||   The Guru sits on the true throne
        in the true mansion; He is attuned, absorbed in the Fearless Lord.
        || 8 ||   The Guru, the detached Yogi, has enticed the hearts
        of all; He plays His harp in each and every heart.  || 9 ||  
        O Nanak, in God's Sanctuary, one is emancipated; the True
        Guru becomes our true help and support.  || 10 || 8 ||   RAAMKALEE,
        FIRST MEHL:  He has made His home in the monastery of the heart;
        He has infused His power into the earth and the sky.  || 1 ||
        Through the Word of the Shabad, the Gurmukhs have saved so very
        many, O Saints.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He conquers attachment,
        and eradicates egotism, and sees Your Divine Light pervading the
        three worlds, Lord.  || 2 ||   He conquers desire, and enshrines
        the Lord within his mind; he contemplates the Word of the True
        Guru's Shabad.  || 3 ||   The horn of consciousness vibrates
        the unstruck sound current; Your Light illuminates each and every
        heart, Lord.  || 4 ||   He plays the flute of the universe in
        his mind, and lights the fire of God.  || 5 ||   Bringing together
        the five elements, day and night, the Lord's lamp shines
        with the Immaculate Light of the Infinite.  || 6 ||   The right
        and left nostrils, the sun and the moon channels, are the strings
        of the body-harp; they vibrate the wondrous melody of the Shabad.
        || 7 ||   The true hermit obtains a seat in the City of God,
        the invisible, inaccessible, infinite.  || 8 ||   The mind is
        the king of the city of the body; the five sources of knowledge
        dwell within it.  || 9 ||   Seated in his home, this king chants
        the Shabad; he administers justice and virtue.  || 10 ||   What
        can poor death or birth say to him? Conquering his mind, he remains
        dead while yet alive. <br>

      <p> || 11 ||   Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are manifestations of the
        One God. He Himself is the Doer of deeds.  || 12 ||   One who
        purifies his body, crosses over the terrifying world-ocean; he
        contemplates the essence of his own soul.  || 13 ||   Serving
        the Guru, he finds everlasting peace; deep within, the Shabad
        permeates him, coloring him with virtue.  || 14 ||   The Giver
        of virtue unites with Himself, one who conquers egotism and desire.
        || 15 ||   Eradicating the three qualities, dwell in the fourth
        state. This is the unparalleled devotional worship.  || 16 ||
        This is the Yoga of the Gurmukh: Through the Shabad, he understands
        his own soul, and he enshrines within his heart the One Lord.
        || 17 ||   Imbued with the Shabad, his mind becomes steady and
        stable; this is the most excellent action.  || 18 ||   This true
        hermit does not enter into religious debates or hypocrisy; the
        Gurmukh contemplates the Shabad.  || 19 ||   The Gurmukh practices
        Yoga - he is the true hermit; he practices abstinence and
        truth, and contemplates the Shabad.  || 20 ||   One who dies in
        the Shabad and conquers his mind is the true hermit; he understands
        the Way of Yoga.  || 21 ||   Attachment to Maya is the terrifying
        world-ocean; through the Shabad, the true hermit saves himself,
        and his ancestors as well.  || 22 ||   Contemplating the Shabad,
        you shall be a hero throughout the four ages, O hermit; contemplate
        the Word of the Guru's Bani in devotion.  || 23 ||   This
        mind is enticed by Maya, O hermit; contemplating the Shabad, you
        shall find release.  || 24 ||   He Himself forgives, and unites
        in His Union; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord.  || 25 || 9 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Make humility your ear-rings, Yogi, and compassion
        your patched coat. Let coming and going be the ashes you apply
        to your body, Yogi, and then you shall conquer the three worlds.
        || 1 ||   Play that harp, Yogi, which vibrates the unstruck sound
        current, and remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   Make truth and contentment your plate and pouch, Yogi; take
        the Ambrosial Naam as your food. Make meditation your walking
        stick, Yogi, and make higher consciousness the horn you blow.
        || 2 ||   Make your stable mind the Yogic posture you sit in,
        Yogi, and then you shall be rid of your tormenting desires. Go
        begging in the village of the body, Yogi, and then, you shall
        obtain the Naam in your lap.  || 3 ||   This harp does not center
        you in meditation, Yogi, nor does it bring the True Name into
        your lap. This harp does not bring you peace, Yogi, nor eliminate
        egotism from within you.  || 4 ||   Make the Fear of God, and
        the Love of God, the two gourds of your lute, Yogi, and make this
        body its neck. Become Gurmukh, and then vibrate the strings; in
        this way, your desires shall depart.  || 5 ||   One who understands
        the Hukam of the Lord's Command is called a Yogi; he links
        his consciousness to the One Lord. His cynicism is dispelled,
        and he becomes immaculately pure; this is how he finds the Way
        of Yoga.  || 6 ||   Everything that comes into view shall be destroyed;
        focus your consciousness on the Lord. </font><br>
