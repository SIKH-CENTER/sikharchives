      <p> When the True Lord and Master abides in one's mind, O Nanak,
        all sins are dispelled.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Millions of sins are
        totally erased, by meditating on the Lord's Name. The fruits
        of one's heart's desires are obtained, by singing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. The fear of birth and death
        is eradicated, and one's eternal, unchanging true home
        is obtained. If it is so pre-ordained, one is absorbed in the
        Lord's lotus feet. Bless me with Your mercy, God -
        please preserve and save me! Nanak is a sacrifice to You.  ||
        5 ||   SHALOK:  They are involved in their beautiful houses, and
        the pleasures of the mind's desires. They never remember
        the Lord in meditation; O Nanak, they are like maggots in manure.
        || 1 ||   They are engrossed in ostentatious displays, lovingly
        attached to all their possessions. That body which forgets the
        Lord, O Nanak, shall be reduced to ashes.  || 2 ||   PAUREE: 
        He may enjoy a beautiful bed, countless pleasures and all sorts
        of enjoyments. He may possess mansions of gold, studded with pearls
        and rubies, plastered with fragrant sandalwood oil. He may relish
        in the pleasures of his mind's desires, and have no anxiety
        at all. But if he does not remember God, he is like a maggot in
        manure. Without the Lord's Name, there is no peace at all.
        How can the mind be comforted?  || 6 ||   SHALOK:  One who loves
        the Lord's lotus feet searches for Him in the ten directions.
        He renounces the deceptive illusion of Maya, and joins the blissful
        form of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 1 ||  
        The Lord is in my mind, and with my mouth I chant His Name; I
        seek Him in all the lands of the world. O Nanak, all ostentatious
        displays are false; hearing the Praises of the True Lord, I live.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He dwells in a broken-down shack, in tattered
        clothes, with no social status, no honor and no respect; he wanders
        in the wilderness, with no friend or lover, without wealth, beauty,
        relatives or relations. Even so, he is the king of the whole world,
        if his mind is imbued with the Lord's Name. With the dust
        of his feet, men are redeemed, because God is very pleased with
        him.  || 7 ||   SHALOK:  The various sorts of pleasures, powers,
        joys, beauty, canopies, cooling fans and thrones to sit on -
        the foolish, ignorant and blind are engrossed in these things.
        O Nanak, desire for Maya is just a dream.  || 1 ||   In a dream,
        he enjoys all sorts of pleasures, and emotional attachment seems
        so sweet. O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the
        beauty of Maya's illusion is fake.  || 2 ||   PAUREE: 
        The fool attaches his consciousness to the dream. When he awakes,
        he forgets the power, pleasures and enjoyments, and he is sad.
        He passes his life chasing after worldly affairs. His works are
        not completed, because he is enticed by Maya. What can the poor
        helpless creature do? The Lord Himself has deluded him.  || 8
        ||   SHALOK:  They may live in heavenly realms, and conquer the
        nine regions of the world, but if they forget the Lord of the
        world, O Nanak, they are just wanderers in the wilderness.  ||
        1 ||   In the midst of millions of games and entertainments, the
        Lord's Name does not come to their minds. O Nanak, their
        home is like a wilderness, in the depths of hell.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        He sees the terrible, awful wilderness as a city. <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p> Gazing upon the false objects, he believes them to be real. Engrossed
        in sexual desire, anger and egotism, he wanders around insane.
        When the Messenger of Death hits him on the head with his club,
        then he regrets and repents. Without the Perfect, Divine Guru,
        he roams around like Satan.  || 9 ||   SHALOK:  Power is fraudulent,
        beauty is fraudulent, and wealth is fraudulent, as is pride of
        ancestry. One may gather poison through deception and fraud, O
        Nanak, but without the Lord, nothing shall go along with him in
        the end.  || 1 ||   Beholding the bitter melon, he is deceived,
        since it appears so pretty. But it is not worth even a shell,
        O Nanak; the riches of Maya will not go along with anyone.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  It shall not go along with you when you depart
        - why do you bother to collect it? Tell me, why do you
        try so hard to acquire that which you must leave behind in the
        end? Forgetting the Lord, how can you be satisfied? Your mind
        cannot be pleased. One who forsakes God, and attaches himself
        to another, shall be immersed in hell. Be kind and compassionate
        to Nanak, O Lord, and dispel his fear.  || 10 ||   SHALOK:  Princely
        pleasures are not sweet; sensual enjoyments are not sweet; the
        pleasures of Maya are not sweet. The Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, is sweet, O slave Nanak; the Blessed Vision of God's
        Darshan is sweet.  || 1 ||   I have enshrined that love which
        drenches my soul. I have been pierced by the Truth, O Nanak; the
        Master seems so sweet to me.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Nothing seems
        sweet to His devotees, except the Lord. All other tastes are bland
        and insipid; I have tested them and seen them. Ignorance, doubt
        and suffering are dispelled, when the Guru becomes one's
        advocate. The Lord's lotus feet have pierced my mind, and
        I am dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love. My soul, breath
        of life, body and mind belong to God; all falsehood has left me.
        || 11 ||   SHALOK:  Leaving the water, the fish cannot live;
        the sparrow-hawk cannot live without the raindrops from the clouds.
        The deer is enticed by the sound of the hunter's bell,
        and shot through with the arrow; the bumble bee is entangled in
        the fragrance of the flowers. The Saints are entranced by the
        Lord's lotus feet; O Nanak, they desire nothing else. 
        || 1 ||   Show me Your face, for even an instant, Lord, and I
        will not give my consciousness to any other. My life is with the
        Lord Master, O Nanak, the Friend of the Saints.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        How can the fish live without water? Without the raindrops, how
        can the sparrow-hawk be satisfied? The deer, entranced by the
        sound of the hunter's bell, runs straight to him; the bumble
        bee is greedy for the flower's fragrance; finding it, he
        traps himself in it. Just so, the humble Saints love the Lord;
        beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, they are satisfied
        and satiated.  || 12 ||   SHALOK:  They contemplate the Lord's
        lotus feet; they worship and adore Him with each and every breath.
        They do not forget the Name of the imperishable Lord; O Nanak,
        the Transcendent Lord fulfills their hopes.  || 1 ||   He is woven
        into the fabric of my mind; He is not outside of it, even for
        an instant. O Nanak, the True Lord and Master fulfills my hopes,
        and always watches over me.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  My hopes rest
        in You, O Lord of the universe; please, fulfill them. Meeting
        with the Lord of the world, the Lord of the universe, I shall
        never grieve. Grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, the
        desire of my mind, and my worries shall be over. <br>

      </p>
      <p> By body is sanctified, by the dust of Your feet. O Supreme Lord
        God, Divine Guru, You are always with me, ever-present.  || 13
        ||   SHALOK:  With my tongue, I chant the Lord's Name;
        with my ears, I listen to the Ambrosial Word of His Shabad. Nanak
        is forever a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Supreme Lord
        God.  || 1 ||   All concerns are false, except those of the One
        Lord. O Nanak, blessed are those, who are in love with their True
        Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  I am forever a sacrifice to those who
        listen to the sermon of the Lord. Those who bow their heads before
        God are perfect and distinguished. Those hands, which write the
        Praises of the infinite Lord are beautiful. Those feet which walk
        on God's Path are pure and holy. In the Society of the
        Saints, they are emancipated; all their sorrows depart.  || 14
        ||   SHALOK:  One's destiny is activated, when one chants
        the Lord's Name, through perfect good fortune. Fruitful
        is that moment, O Nanak, when one obtains the Blessed Vision of
        the Darshan of the Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||   Its value
        cannot be estimated; it brings peace beyond measure. O Nanak,
        that time alone is approved, when my Beloved meets with me.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  Tell me, what is that time, when I shall find
        God? Blessed and auspicious is that moment, and that destiny,
        when I shall find the Lord of the Universe. Meditating on the
        Lord, twenty-four hours a day, my mind's desires are fulfilled.
        By great good fortune, I have found the Society of the Saints;
        I bow and touch their feet. My mind thirsts for the Blessed Vision
        of the Lord's Darshan; Nanak is a sacrifice to Him.  ||
        15 ||   SHALOK:  The Lord of the Universe is the Purifier of sinners;
        He is the Dispeller of all distress. The Lord God is Mighty, giving
        His Protective Sanctuary; Nanak chants the Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har.  || 1 ||   Renouncing all self-conceit, I hold tight to the
        Lord's Feet. My sorrows and troubles have departed, O Nanak,
        beholding God.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Unite with me, O Merciful Lord;
        I have fallen at Your Door. It is Your very nature to love Your
        devotees, and save sinners. Without You, there is no other at
        all; I offer this prayer to You. Take me by the hand, O Merciful
        Lord, and carry me across the world-ocean.  || 16 ||   SHALOK:
        The Merciful Lord is the Savior of the Saints; their only support
        is to sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. One becomes
        immaculate and pure, by associating with the Saints, O Nanak,
        and taking the Protection of the Transcendent Lord.  || 1 || 
        The burning of the heart is not dispelled at all, by sandalwood
        paste, the moon, or the cold season. It only becomes cool, O Nanak,
        by chanting the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Through
        the Protection and Support of the Lord's lotus feet, all
        beings are saved. Hearing of the Glory of the Lord of the Universe,
        the mind becomes fearless. Nothing at all is lacking, when one
        gathers the wealth of the Naam. The Society of the Saints is obtained,
        by very good deeds. Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on the Lord,
        and listen continually to the Lord's Praises.  || 17 ||
        SHALOK:  The Lord grants His Grace, and dispels the pains of
        those who sing the Kirtan of the Praises of His Name. <br>

      </p>
      <p> When the Lord God shows His Kindness, O Nanak, one is no longer
        engrossed in Maya.  || 1 ||   The burning fire has been put out;
        God Himself has saved me. Meditate on that God, O Nanak, who created
        the universe.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  When God becomes merciful, Maya
        does not cling. Millions of sins are eliminated, by meditating
        on the Naam, the Name of the One Lord. The body is made immaculate
        and pure, bathing in the dust of the feet of the Lord's
        humble servants. The mind and body become contented, finding the
        Perfect Lord God. One is saved, along with his family, and all
        his ancestors.  || 18 ||   SHALOK:  The Guru is the Lord of the
        Universe; the Guru is the Lord of the world; the Guru is the Perfect
        Pervading Lord God. The Guru is compassionate; the Guru is all-powerful;
        the Guru, O Nanak, is the Saving Grace of sinners.  || 1 ||  
        The Guru is the boat, to cross over the dangerous, treacherous,
        unfathomable world-ocean. O Nanak, by perfect good karma, one
        is attached to the feet of the True Guru.  || 2 ||   PAUREE: 
        Blessed, blessed is the Divine Guru; associating with Him, one
        meditates on the Lord. When the Guru becomes merciful, then all
        one's demerits are dispelled. The Supreme Lord God, the
        Divine Guru, uplifts and exalts the lowly. Cutting away the painful
        noose of Maya, He makes us His own slaves. With my tongue, I sing
        the Glorious Praises of the infinite Lord God.  || 19 ||   SHALOK:
        I see only the One Lord; I hear only the One Lord; the One Lord
        is all-pervading. Nanak begs for the gift of the Naam; O Merciful
        Lord God, please grant Your Grace.  || 1 ||   I serve the One
        Lord, I contemplate the One Lord, and to the One Lord, I offer
        my prayer. Nanak has gathered in the wealth, the merchandise of
        the Naam; this is the true capital.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  God is
        merciful and infinite. The One and Only is all-pervading. He Himself
        is all-in-all. Who else can we speak of? God Himself grants His
        gifts, and He Himself receives them. Coming and going are all
        by the Hukam of Your Will; Your place is steady and unchanging.
        Nanak begs for this gift; by Your Grace, Lord, please grant me
        Your Name.  || 20 || 1 || <br>

        ||   You are called the Lord and Master, the Guru of the World.
        I am called a lustful being of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga.  ||
        1 ||   The five vices have corrupted my mind. Moment by moment,
        they lead me further away from the Lord.  || 2 ||   Wherever I
        look, I see loads of pain and suffering. I do not have faith,
        even though the Vedas bear witness to the Lord.  || 3 ||   Shiva
        cut off Brahma's head, and Gautam's wife and the
        Lord Indra mated; Brahma's head got stuck to Shiva's
        hand, and Indra came to bear the marks of a thousand female organs.
        || 4 ||   These demons have fooled, bound and destroyed me. I
        am very shameless - even now, I am not tired of them. 
        || 5 ||   Says Ravi Daas, what am I to do now? Without the Sanctuary
        of the Lord's Protection, who else's should I seek?
