      <p> The Beloved Himself instills the Fear of God; He binds the tiger
        and the goat together.  || 2 ||   The Beloved Lord Himself is
        the firewood, and He Himself keeps the fire within the wood. The
        Beloved Lord Himself, all by Himself, permeates them, and because
        of the Fear of God, the fire cannot burn the wood. The Beloved
        Himself kills and revives; all draw the breath of life, given
        by Him.  || 3 ||   The Beloved Himself is power and presence;
        He Himself engages us in our work. As the Beloved makes me walk,
        I walk, as it pleases my Lord God. The Beloved Himself is the
        musician, and the musical instrument; servant Nanak vibrates His
        vibration.  || 4 || 4 ||   SORAT'H,  FOURTH MEHL:  The Beloved
        Himself created the Universe; He made the light of the sun and
        the moon. The Beloved Himself is the power of the powerless; He
        Himself is the honor of the dishonored. The Beloved Himself grants
        His Grace and protects us; He Himself is wise and all-knowing.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and receive
        His Insignia. Join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and
        meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; you shall not have to come and
        go in reincarnation again.  ||  Pause  ||   The Beloved Himself
        pervades His Glorious Praises, and He Himself approves them. The
        Beloved Himself grants His forgiveness, and He Himself bestows
        the Insignia of Truth. The Beloved Himself obeys His Will, and
        He Himself issues His Command.  || 2 ||   The Beloved Himself
        is the treasure of devotion; He Himself gives His gifts. The Beloved
        Himself commits some to His service, and He Himself blesses them
        with honor. The Beloved Himself is absorbed in Samaadhi; He Himself
        is the treasure of excellence.  || 3 ||   The Beloved Himself
        is the greatest; He Himself is supreme. The Beloved Himself appraises
        the value; He Himself is the scale, and the weights. The Beloved
        Himself is unweighable  -  He weighs Himself; servant Nanak
        is forever a sacrifice to Him.  || 4 || 5 ||   SORAT'H, 
        FOURTH MEHL:  The Beloved Himself commits some to His service;
        He Himself blesses them with the joy of devotional worship. The
        Beloved Himself causes us to sing His Glorious Praises; He Himself
        is absorbed in the Word of His Shabad. He Himself is the pen,
        and He Himself is the scribe; He Himself inscribes His inscription.
        || 1 ||   O my mind, joyfully chant the Name of the Lord. Those
        very fortunate ones are in ecstasy night and day; through the
        Perfect Guru, they obtain the profit of the Lord's Name.
        ||  Pause  ||   The Beloved Himself is the milk-maid and Krishna;
        He Himself herds the cows in the woods. The Beloved Himself is
        the blue-skinned, handsome one; He Himself plays on His flute.
        The Beloved Himself took the form of a child, and destroyed Kuwalia-peer,
        the mad elephant.  || 2 ||   The Beloved Himself sets the stage;
        He performs the plays, and He Himself watches them. The Beloved
        Himself assumed the form of the child, and killed the demons Chandoor,
        Kansa and Kaysee. The Beloved Himself, by Himself, is the embodiment
        of power; He shatters the power of the fools and idiots.  || 3
        ||   The Beloved Himself created the whole world. </p>

      <p> In His hands He holds the power of the ages. The Beloved Himself
        puts the chains around their necks; as God pulls them, must they
        go. Whoever harbors pride shall be destroyed, O Beloved; meditating
        on the Lord, Nanak is absorbed in devotional worship.  || 4 ||
        6 ||   SORAT'H,  FOURTH MEHL,  DU-TUKAS:  Separated from
        the Lord for countless lifetimes, the self-willed manmukh suffers
        in pain, engaged in acts of egotism. Beholding the Holy Saint,
        I found God; O Lord of the Universe, I seek Your Sanctuary.  ||
        1 ||   The Love of God is very dear to me. When I joined the Sat
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy People, the Lord, the embodiment
        of peace, came into my heart.  ||  Pause  ||   You dwell, hidden,
        within my heart day and night, Lord; but the poor fools do not
        understand Your Love. Meeting with the Almighty True Guru, God
        was revealed to me; I sing His Glorious Praises, and reflect upon
        His Glories.  || 2 ||   As Gurmukh, I have become enlightened;
        peace has come, and evil-mindedness has been dispelled from my
        mind. Understanding the relationship of the individual soul with
        God, I have found peace, in Your Sat Sangat, Your True Congregation,
        O Lord.  || 3 ||   Those who are blessed by Your Kind Mercy, meet
        the Almighty Lord, and find the Guru. Nanak has found the immeasurable,
        celestial peace; night and day, he remains awake to the Lord,
        the Master of the Forest of the Universe.  || 4 || 7 ||   SORAT'H,
        FOURTH MEHL:  The inner depths of my mind are pierced by love
        for the Lord; I cannot live without the Lord. Just as the fish
        dies without water, I die without the Lord's Name.  || 1
        ||   O my God, please bless me with the water of Your Name. I
        beg for Your Name, deep within myself, day and night; through
        the Name, I find peace.  ||  Pause  ||   The song-bird cries out
        for lack of water  -  without water, its thirst cannot be quenched.
        The Gurmukh obtains the water of celestial bliss, and is rejuvenated,
        blossoming forth through the blessed Love of the Lord.  || 2 ||
        The self-willed manmukhs are hungry, wandering around in the
        ten directions; without the Name, they suffer in pain. They are
        born, only to die, and enter into reincarnation again; in the
        Court of the Lord, they are punished.  || 3 ||   But if the Lord
        shows His Mercy, then one comes to sing His Glorious Praises;
        deep within the nucleus of his own self, he finds the sublime
        essence of the Lord's elixir. The Lord has become Merciful
        to meek Nanak, and through the Word of the Shabad, his desires
        are quenched.  || 4 || 8 ||   SORAT'H,  FOURTH MEHL,  PANCH-PADAS:
        If one eats the uneatable, then he becomes a Siddha, a being
        of perfect spirituality; through this perfection, he obtains wisdom.
        When the arrow of the Lord's Love pierces his body, then
        his doubt is eradicated.  || 1 ||   O my Lord of the Universe,
        please bless Your humble servant with glory. Under Guru's
        Instructions, enlighten me with the Lord's Name, that I may
        dwell forever in Your Sanctuary.  ||  Pause  ||   This whole world
        is engrossed in coming and going; O my foolish and ignorant mind,
        be mindful of the Lord. O Dear Lord, please, take pity upon me,
        and unite me with the Guru, that I may merge in the Lord's
        Name.  || 2 ||   Only one who has it knows God; he alone has it,
        to whom God has given it  -  so very beautiful, unapproachable
        and unfathomable. Through the Perfect Guru, the unknowable is
        known.  || 3 ||   Only one who tastes it knows it, like the mute,
        who tastes the sweet candy, but cannot speak of it. </p>

      <p> The jewel is concealed, but it is not concealed, even though one
        may try to conceal it.  || 4 ||   Everything is Yours, O Inner-knower,
        Searcher of hearts; You are the Lord God of all. He alone receives
        the gift, unto whom You give it; O servant Nanak, there is no
        one else.  || 5 || 9 || </p>

        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  TI-TUKAS:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> Who should I ask? Who should I worship? All were created by Him.
        Whoever appears to be the greatest of the great, shall ultimately
        be mixed with the dust. The Fearless, Formless Lord, the Destroyer
        of Fear bestows all comforts, and the nine treasures.  || 1 ||
        O Dear Lord, Your gifts alone satisfy me. Why should I praise
        the poor helpless man? Why should I feel subservient to him? 
        ||  Pause  ||   All things come to one who meditates on the Lord;
        the Lord satisfies his hunger. The Lord, the Giver of peace, bestows
        such wealth, that it can never be exhausted. I am in ecstasy,
        absorbed in celestial peace; the True Guru has united me in His
        Union.  || 2 ||   O mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord;
        worship the Naam, night and day, and recite the Naam. Listen to
        the Teachings of the Holy Saints, and all fear of death will be
        dispelled. Those blessed by God's Grace are attached to the
        Word of the Guru's Bani.  || 3 ||   Who can estimate Your
        worth, God? You are kind and compassionate to all beings. Everything
        which You do, prevails; I am just a poor child  -  what can
        I do? Protect and preserve Your servant Nanak; be kind to him,
        like a father to his son.  || 4 || 1 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH
        MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  CHAU-TUKAS:  Praise the Guru, and the Lord
        of the Universe, O Siblings of Destiny; enshrine Him in your mind,
        body and heart. Let the True Lord and Master abide in your mind,
        O Siblings of Destiny; this is the most excellent way of life.
        Those bodies, in which the Name of the Lord does not well up,
        O Siblings of Destiny  -  those bodies are reduced to ashes.
        I am a sacrifice to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        O Siblings of Destiny; they take the Support of the One and Only
        Lord.  || 1 ||   So worship and adore that True Lord, O Siblings
        of Destiny; He alone does everything. The Perfect Guru has taught
        me, O Siblings of Destiny, that without Him, there is no other
        at all.  ||  Pause  ||   Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        they putrefy and die, O Siblings of Destiny; their numbers cannot
        be counted. Without Truth, purity cannot be achieved, O Siblings
        of Destiny; the Lord is true and unfathomable. Coming and going
        do not end, O Siblings of Destiny; pride in worldly valuables
        is false. The Gurmukh saves millions of people, O Siblings of
        Destiny, blessing them with even a particle of the Name.  || 2
        ||   I have searched through the Simritees and the Shaastras,
        O Siblings of Destiny  -  without the True Guru, doubt does
        not depart. They are so tired of performing their many deeds,
        O Siblings of Destiny, but they fall into bondage again and again.
        I have searched in the four directions, O Siblings of Destiny,
        but without the True Guru, there is no place at all. </p>

      </p>
      <p> By great good fortune, I found the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny,
        and I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 ||   The
        Truth is forever pure, O Siblings of Destiny; those who are true
        are pure. When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, O Siblings
        of Destiny, then one obtains Him. Among millions, O Siblings of
        Destiny, hardly one humble servant of the Lord is found. Nanak
        is imbued with the True Name, O Siblings of Destiny; hearing it,
        the mind and body become immaculately pure.  || 4 || 2 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL,  DU-TUKAS:  As long as this person believes in love
        and hate, it is difficult for him to meet the Lord. As long as
        he discriminates between himself and others, he will distance
        himself from the Lord.  || 1 ||   O Lord, grant me such understanding,
        that I might serve the Holy Saints, and seek the protection of
        their feet, and not forget them, for a moment, even an instant.
        ||  Pause  ||   O foolish, thoughtless and fickle mind, such
        understanding did not come into your heart. Renouncing the Lord
        of Life, you have become engrossed in other things, and you are
        involved with your enemies.  || 2 ||   Sorrow does not afflict
        one who does not harbor self-conceit; in the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, I have attained this understanding. Know
        that the babbling of the faithless cynic is like wind passing
        by.  || 3 ||   This mind is inundated by millions of sins  - 
        what can I say? Nanak, Your humble servant has come to Your Sanctuary,
        God; please, erase all his accounts.  || 4 || 3 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Children, spouses, men and women in one's household,
        are all bound by Maya. At the very last moment, none of them shall
        stand by you; their love is totally false.  || 1 ||   O man, why
        do you pamper your body so? It shall disperse like a cloud of
        smoke; vibrate upon the One, the Beloved Lord.  ||  Pause  ||
        There are three ways in which the body can be consumed  - 
        it can be thrown into water, given to the dogs, or cremated to
        ashes. He considers himself to be immortal; he sits in his home,
        and forgets the Lord, the Cause of causes.  || 2 ||   In various
        ways, the Lord has fashioned the beads, and strung them on a slender
        thread. The thread shall break, O wretched man, and then, you
        shall repent and regret.  || 3 ||   He created you, and after
        creating you, He adorned you  -  meditate on Him day and night.
        God has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; I hold tight to
        the Support of the True Guru.  || 4 || 4 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  I met the True Guru, by great good fortune, and my mind
        has been enlightened. No one else can equal me, because I have
        the loving support of my Lord and Master.  || 1 ||   I am a sacrifice
        to my True Guru. I am at peace in this world, and I shall be in
        celestial peace in the next; my home is filled with bliss.  ||
        Pause  ||   He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the
        Creator, my Lord and Master. I have become fearless, attached
        to the Guru's feet; I take the Support of the Name of the
        One Lord.  || 2 ||   Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of His Darshan;
        the Form of God is deathless; He is and shall always be. He hugs
        His humble servants close, and protects and preserves them; their
        love for Him is sweet to Him.  || 3 ||   Great is His glorious
        greatness, and wondrous is His magnificence; through Him, all
        affairs are resolved. </p>

      <p> Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru; all his sorrows have been
        dispelled.  || 4 || 5 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  To the
        happy person, everyone seems happy; to the sick person, everyone
        seems sick. The Lord and Master acts, and causes us to act; union
        is in His Hands.  || 1 ||   O my mind, no one appears to be mistaken,
        to one who has dispelled his own doubts; he realizes that everyone
        is God.  ||  Pause  ||   One whose mind is comforted in the Society
        of the Saints, believes that all are joyful. One whose mind is
        afflicted by the disease of egotism, cries out in birth and death.
        || 2 ||   Everything is clear to one whose eyes are blessed with
        the ointment of spiritual wisdom. In the darkness of spiritual
        ignorance, he sees nothing at all; he wanders around in reincarnation,
        over and over again.  || 3 ||   Hear my prayer, O Lord and Master;
        Nanak begs for this happiness: whereever Your Holy Saints sing
        the Kirtan of Your Praises, let my mind be attached to that place.
        || 4 || 6 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  My body belongs to
        the Saints, my wealth belongs to the Saints, and my mind belongs
        to the Saints. By the Grace of the Saints, I meditate on the Lord's
        Name, and then, all comforts come to me.  || 1 ||   Without the
        Saints, there are no other givers. Whoever takes to the Sanctuary
        of the Holy Saints, is carried across.  ||  Pause  ||   Millions
        of sins are erased by serving the humble Saints, and singing the
        Glorious Praises of the Lord with love. One finds peace in this
        world, and one's face is radiant in the next world, by associating
        with the humble Saints, through great good fortune.  || 2 || 
        I have only one tongue, and the Lord's humble servant is
        filled with countless virtues; how can I sing his praises? The
        inaccessible, unapproachable and eternally unchanging Lord is
        obtained in the Sanctuary of the Saints.  || 3 ||   I am worthless,
        lowly, without friends or support, and full of sins; I long for
        the Shelter of the Saints. I am drowning in the deep, dark pit
        of household attachments  -  please save me, Lord!  || 4 ||
        7 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:  O Creator Lord,
        You fulfill the desires of those, within whose heart You abide.
        Your slaves do not forget You; the dust of Your feet is pleasing
        to their minds.  || 1 ||   Your Unspoken Speech cannot be spoken.
        O treasure of excellence, Giver of peace, Lord and Master, Your
        greatness is the highest of all.  ||  Pause  ||   The mortal does
        those deeds, and those alone, which You ordained by destiny. Your
        servant, whom You bless with Your service, is satisfied and fulfilled,
        beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.  || 2 ||   You are
        contained in all, but he alone realizes this, whom You bless with
        understanding. By Guru's Grace, his spiritual ignorance is
        dispelled, and he is respected everywhere.  || 3 ||   He alone
        is spiritually enlightened, he alone is a meditator, and he alone
        is a man of good nature. Says Nanak, one unto whom the Lord becomes
        Merciful, does not forget the Lord from his mind.  || 4 || 8 ||
        SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The whole creation is engrossed
        in emotional attachment; sometimes, one is high, and at other
        times, low. </p>

      <p> No one can be purified by any rituals or devices; they cannot
        reach their goal.  || 1 ||   O my mind, emancipation is attained
        in the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints. Without the Perfect Guru,
        births and deaths do not cease, and one comes and goes, over and
        over again.  ||  Pause  ||   The whole world is entangled in what
        is called the delusion of doubt. The perfect devotee of the Primal
        Lord God remains detached from everything.  || 2 ||   Don't
        indulge in slander for any reason, for everything is the creation
        of the Lord and Master. One who is blessed with the Mercy of my
        God, dwells on the Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy.  || 3 ||   The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord,
        the True Guru, saves all. Says Nanak, without the Guru, no one
        crosses over; this is the perfect essence of all contemplation.
        || 4 || 9 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have searched and
        searched and searched, and found that the Lord's Name is
        the most sublime reality. Contemplating it for even an instant,
        sins are erased; the Gurmukh is carried across and saved.  ||
        1 ||   Drink in the sublime essence of the Lord's Name, O
        man of spiritual wisdom. Listening to the Ambrosial Words of the
        Holy Saints, the mind finds absolute fulfillment and satisfaction.
        ||  Pause  ||   Liberation, pleasures, and the true way of life
        are obtained from the Lord, the Giver of all peace. The Perfect
        Lord, the Architect of Destiny, blesses His slave with the gift
        of devotional worship.  || 2 ||   Hear with your ears, and sing
        with your tongue, and meditate within your heart on Him. The Lord
        and Master is all-powerful, the Cause of causes; without Him,
        there is nothing at all.  || 3 ||   By great good fortune, I have
        obtained the jewel of human life; have mercy on me, O Merciful
        Lord. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak sings
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and contemplates Him forever
        in meditation.  || 4 || 10 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  After
        taking your cleansing bath, remember your God in meditation, and
        your mind and body shall be free of disease. Millions of obstacles
        are removed, in the Sanctuary of God, and good fortune dawns.
        || 1 ||   The Word of God's Bani, and His Shabad, are the
        best utterances. So constantly sing them, listen to them, and
        read them, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Perfect Guru shall save
        you.  ||  Pause  ||   The glorious greatness of the True Lord
        is immeasurable; the Merciful Lord is the Lover of His devotees.
        He has preserved the honor of His Saints; from the very beginning
        of time, His Nature is to cherish them.  || 2 ||   So eat the
        Ambrosial Name of the Lord as your food; put it into your mouth
        at all times. The pains of old age and death shall all depart,
        when you constantly sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
        Universe.  || 3 ||   My Lord and Master has heard my prayer, and
        all my affairs have been resolved. The glorious greatness of Guru
        Nanak is manifest, throughout all the ages.  || 4 || 11 || </p>

      <p> Listen, friends: my soul is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You; O
        Lord, reveal to me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.  || 1 ||
        Listen, friends: I am a sacrifice to the dust of Your feet.
        This mind is yours, O Siblings of Destiny.  ||  Pause  ||   I
        wash your feet, I massage and clean them; I give this mind to
        you. Listen, friends: I have come to Your Sanctuary; teach me,
        that I might unite with God.  || 2 ||   Do not be proud; seek
        His Sanctuary, and accept as good all that He does. Listen, friends:
        dedicate your soul, body and your whole being to Him; thus you
        shall receive the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.  || 3 ||   He
        has shown mercy to me, by the Grace of the Saints; the Lord's
        Name is sweet to me. The Guru has shown mercy to servant Nanak;
        I see the casteless, immaculate Lord everywhere.  || 4 || 1 ||
        12 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  God is the Lord and Master
        of millions of universes; He is the Giver of all beings. He ever
        cherishes and cares for all beings, but the fool does not appreciate
        any of His virtues.  || 1 ||   I do not know how to worship the
        Lord in adoration. I can only repeat,  &quot;Lord, Lord, Guru,
        Guru.&quot;  O Dear Lord, I go by the name of the Lord's
        slave.  ||  Pause  ||   The Compassionate Lord is Merciful to
        the meek, the ocean of peace; He fills all hearts. He sees, hears,
        and is always with me; but I am a fool, and I think that He is
        far away.  || 2 ||   The Lord is limitless, but I can only describe
        Him within my limitations; what do I know, about what He is like?
        I offer my prayer to my True Guru; I am so foolish  -  please,
        teach me!  || 3 ||   I am just a fool, but millions of sinners
        just like me have been saved. Those who have heard, and seen Guru
        Nanak, do not descend into the womb of reincarnation again.  ||
        4 || 2 || 13 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those things, which
        caused me such anxiety, have all vanished. Now, I sleep in peace
        and tranquility, and my mind is in a state of deep and profound
        peace; the inverted lotus of my heart has blossomed forth.  ||
        1 ||   Behold, a wondrous miracle has happened! That Lord and
        Master, whose wisdom is said to be unfathomable, has been enshrined
        within my heart, by the Guru.  ||  Pause  ||   The demons which
        tormented me so much, have themselves become terrified. They pray:
        please, save us from your Lord Master; we seek your protection.
        || 2 ||   When the treasure of the Lord of the Universe is opened,
        those who are pre-destined, receive it. The Guru has given me
        the one jewel, and my mind and body have become peaceful and tranquil.
        || 3 ||   The Guru has blessed me with the one drop of Ambrosial
        Nectar, and so I have become stable, unmoving and immortal  - 
        I shall not die. The Lord blessed Guru Nanak with the treasure
        of devotional worship, and did not call him to account again.
        || 4 || 3 || 14 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those whose
        minds are attached to the lotus feet of the Lord  -  those
        humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled. But those, within whose
        hearts the priceless virtue does not abide  -  those men remain
        thirsty and unsatisfied.  || 1 ||   Worshipping the Lord in adoration,
        one becomes happy, and free of disease. But one who forgets my
        Dear Lord  -  know him to be afflicted with tens of thousands
        of illnesses. </p>

        happy in Your Sanctuary. But those humble beings who forget the
        Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, are counted among the most
        miserable beings.  || 2 ||   One who has faith in the Guru, and
        who is lovingly attached to God, enjoys the delights of supreme
        ecstasy. One who forgets God and forsakes the Guru, falls into
        the most horrible hell.  || 3 ||   As the Lord engages someone,
        so he is engaged, and so does he perform. Nanak has taken to the
        Shelter of the Saints; his heart is absorbed in the Lord's
        feet.  || 4 || 4 || 15 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  As the
        king is entangled in kingly affairs, and the egotist in his own
        egotism, and the greedy man is enticed by greed, so is the spiritually
        enlightened being absorbed in the Love of the Lord.  || 1 || 
        This is what befits the Lord's servant. Beholding the Lord
        near at hand, he serves the True Guru, and he is satisfied through
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.  ||  Pause  ||   The addict
        is addicted to his drug, and the landlord is in love with his
        land. As the baby is attached to his milk, so the Saint is in
        love with God.  || 2 ||   The scholar is absorbed in scholarship,
        and the eyes are happy to see. As the tongue savors the tastes,
        so does the humble servant of the Lord sing the Glorious Praises
        of the Lord.  || 3 ||   As is the hunger, so is the fulfiller;
        He is the Lord and Master of all hearts. Nanak thirsts for the
        Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; he has met God, the
        Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.  || 4 || 5 || 16 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  We are filthy, and You are immaculate, O Creator
        Lord; we are worthless, and You are the Great Giver. We are fools,
        and You are wise and all-knowing. You are the knower of all things.
        || 1 ||   O Lord, this is what we are, and this is what You are.
        We are sinners, and You are the Destroyer of sins. Your abode
        is so beautiful, O Lord and Master.  ||  Pause  ||   You fashion
        all, and having fashioned them, You bless them. You bestow upon
        them soul, body and the breath of life. We are worthless  - 
        we have no virtue at all; please, bless us with Your gift, O Merciful
        Lordand Master.  || 2 ||   You do good for us, but we do not see
        it as good; You are kind and compassionate, forever and ever.
        You are the Giver of peace, the Primal Lord, the Architect of
        Destiny; please, save us, Your children!  || 3 ||   You are the
        treasure, eternal Lord King; all beings and creatures beg of You.
        Says Nanak, such is our condition; please, Lord, keep us on the
        Path of the Saints.  || 4 || 6 || 17 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH
        MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:  In our mother's womb, You blessed us
        with Your meditative remembrance, and You preserved us there.
        Through the countless waves of the ocean of fire, please, carry
        us across and save us, O Savior Lord!  || 1 ||   O Lord, You are
        the Master above my head. Here and hereafter, You alone are my
        Support.  ||  Pause  ||   He looks upon the creation like a mountain
        of gold, and sees the Creator as a blade of grass. You are the
        Great Giver, and we are all mere beggars; O God, You give gifts
        according to Your Will.  || 2 ||   In an instant, You are one
        thing, and in another instant, You are another. Wondrous are Your

        inaccessible and infinite.  || 3 ||   When You brought me to the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, then I heard the Bani of
        Your Word. Nanak is in ecstasy, beholding the Glory of the Primal
        Lord of Nirvaanaa.  || 4 || 7 || 18 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  I am the dust of the feet of the Beloved Saints; I seek
        the Protection of their Sanctuary. The Saints are my all-powerful
        Support; the Saints are my ornament and decoration.  || 1 || 
        I am hand and glove with the Saints. I have realized my pre-ordained
        destiny. This mind is yours, O Siblings of Destiny.  ||  Pause
        ||   My dealings are with the Saints, and my business is with
        the Saints. I have earned the profit with the Saints, and the
        treasure filled to over-flowing with devotion to the Lord.  ||
        2 ||   The Saints entrusted to me the capital, and my mind's
        delusion was dispelled. What can the Righteous Judge of Dharma
        do now? All my accounts have been torn up.  || 3 ||   I have found
        the greatest bliss, and I am at peace, by the Grace of the Saints.
        Says Nanak, my mind is reconciled with the Lord; it is imbued
        with the wondrous Love of the Lord.  || 4 || 8 || 19 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  All the things that you see, O man, you shall have
        to leave behind. Let your dealings be with the Lord's Name,
        and you shall attain the state of Nirvaanaa.  || 1 ||   O my Beloved,
        You are the Giver of peace. The Perfect Guru has given me these
        Teachings, and I am attuned to You.  ||  Pause  ||   In sexual
        desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and self-conceit, peace
        is not to be found. So be the dust of the feet of all, O my mind,
        and then you shall find bliss, joy and peace.  || 2 ||   He knows
        the condition of your inner self, and He will not let your work
        go in vain  -  serve Him, O mind. Worship Him, and dedicate
        this mind unto Him, the Image of the Undying Lord, the Divine
        Guru.  || 3 ||   He is the Lord of the Universe, the Compassionate
        Lord, the Supreme Lord God, the Formless Lord. The Naam is my
        merchandise, the Naam is my nourishment; the Naam, O Nanak, is
        the Support of my breath of life.  || 4 || 9 || 20 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  He infuses the breath into the dead bodies, and
        he reunited the separated ones. Even beasts, demons and fools
        become attentive listeners, when He sings the Praises of the Lord's
        Name.  || 1 ||   Behold the glorious greatness of the Perfect
        Guru. His worth cannot be described.  ||  Pause  ||   He has demolished
        the abode of sorrow and disease, and brought bliss, joy and happiness.
        He effortlessly awards the fruits of the mind's desire, and
        all works are brought to perfection.  || 2 ||   He finds peace
        in this world, and his face is radiant in the world hereafter;
        his comings and goings are finished. He becomes fearless, and
        his heart is filled with the Naam, the Name of the Lord; his mind
        is pleasing to the True Guru.  || 3 ||   Standing up and sitting
        down, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; his pain, sorrow
        and doubt are dispelled. Says Nanak, his karma is perfect; his
        mind is attached to the Guru's feet.  || 4 || 10 || 21 ||

        the Transcendent Lord.  || 1 ||   Meditate in remembrance on the
        Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O mortal. Your frail body shall perish,
        you ignorant fool.  ||  Pause  ||   Illusions and dream-objects
        possess nothing of greatness. Without meditating on the Lord,
        nothing succeeds, and nothing will go along with you.  || 2 ||
        Acting in egotism and pride, his life passes away, and he does
        nothing for his soul. Wandering and wandering all around, he is
        never satisfied; he does not remember the Name of the Lord.  ||
        3 ||   Intoxicated with the taste of corruption, cruel pleasures
        and countless sins, he is consigned to the cycle of reincarnation.
        Nanak offers his prayer to God, to eradicate his demerits.  ||
        4 || 11 || 22 ||   SORAT'H,  FIFTH MEHL:  Sing the Glorious
        Praises of the Perfect, Imperishable Lord, and the poison of sexual
        desire and anger shall be burnt away. You shall cross over the
        awesome, arduous ocean of fire, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy.  || 1 ||   The Perfect Guru has dispelled the darkness
        of doubt. Remember God with love and devotion; He is near at hand.
        ||  Pause  ||   Drink in the sublime essence, the treasure of
        the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and your mind and body shall remain
        satisfied. The Transcendent Lord is totally permeating and pervading
        everywhere; where would He come from, and where would He go? 
        || 2 ||   One whose mind is filled with the Lord, is a person
        of meditation, penance, self-restraint and spiritual wisdom, and
        a knower of reality. The Gurmukh obtains the jewel of the Naam;
        his efforts come to perfect fruition.  || 3 ||   All his struggles,
        sufferings and pains are dispelled, and the noose of death is
        cut away from him. Says Nanak, God has extended His Mercy, and
        so his mind and body blossom forth.  || 4 || 12 || 23 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  God is the Doer, the Cause of causes, the Great
        Giver; God is the Supreme Lord and Master. The Merciful Lord created
        all beings; God is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.

        Praises, and worshipping in adoration the Name of the Lord, I
        have reached my destination. || 2 ||   Everyone applauds and congratulates
        me; the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is dear to me.
        I am forever a sacrifice to my God, who has totally protected
        and preserved my honor.  || 3 ||   They are saved, who receive
        the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; they listen to the spiritual
        dialogue of the Naam. Nanak's God has become Merciful to
        him; he has arrived home in ecstasy.  || 4 || 13 || 24 ||   SORAT'H,
        FIFTH MEHL:  In God's Sanctuary, all fears depart, suffering
        disappears, and peace is obtained. When the Supreme Lord God and
        Master becomes merciful, we meditate on the Perfect True Guru.
        || 1 ||   O Dear God, You are my Lord Master and Great Giver.

        of emotional attachment to Maya, he does not know the Lord, the
        Great Giver. The Lord created his body and fashioned his soul,
        but he claims that his power is his own.  || 1 ||   O foolish
        mind, God, your Lord and Master is watching over you. Whatever
        you do, He knows; nothing can remain concealed from Him.  || 
        Pause  ||   You are intoxicated with the tastes of the tongue,
        with greed and pride; countless sins spring from these. You wandered
        in pain through countless incarnations, weighed down by the chains
        of egotism.  || 2 ||   Behind closed doors, hidden by many screens,
        the man takes his pleasure with another man's wife. When

        Lord God has become my helper and friend; His sermon and the Kirtan
        of His Praises have brought me peace. Chant the Word of the Perfect
        Guru's Bani, and be ever in bliss, O mortal.  || 1 ||   Remember
        the True Lord in meditation, O Siblings of Destiny. In the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, eternal peace is obtained, and
        the Lord is never forgotten.  ||  Pause  ||   Your Name, O Transcendent
        Lord, is Ambrosial Nectar; whoever meditates on it, lives. One
        who is blessed with God's Grace  -  that humble servant
        becomes immaculate and pure.  || 2 ||   Obstacles are removed,
        and all pains are eliminated; my mind is attached to the Guru's
        feet. Singing the Glorious Praises of the immovable and imperishable

        be dispelled.  || 1 ||   O Saints, show me such a way, by which
        my egotism and pride might be eliminated.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||

        of all.  || 2 ||   I see God always with me, and the wall of doubt
        has been shattered.  || 3 ||   The medicine of the Naam, and the
        Immaculate Water of Ambrosial Nectar, are obtained through the
        Guru's Gate.  || 4 ||   Says Nanak, one who has such pre-ordained
        destiny inscribed upon his forehead, meets with the Guru, and
