        has found His limits. I am a child - You cherish and sustain
        me. You are the Great Primal Being, my Mother and Father.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Names of the Lord are Countless and Unfathomable.
        My Sovereign Lord is Unfathomable and Incomprehensible. The virtuous
        and the spiritual teachers have given it great thought, but they
        have not found even an iota of His Value.  || 1 ||   They sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe forever.
        They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, but
        they do not find His limits. You are Immeasurable, Unweighable,
        and Infinite, O Lord and Master; no matter how much one may meditate
        on You, Your Depth cannot be fathomed.  || 2 ||   Lord, Your humble
        servants praise You, singing Your Glorious Praises, O Sovereign
        Lord. You are the ocean of water, and I am Your fish. No one has
        ever found Your limits. Please be Kind to Your humble servant,
        Lord; please bless me with the meditation of Your Name. I am a
        blind fool; Your Name is my only Support. Servant Nanak, as Gurmukh,
        has found it.  || 4 || 1 ||   KALYAAN,  FOURTH MEHL:  The humble
        servant of the Lord sings the Lord's Praise, and blossoms
        forth. My intellect is embellished with devotion to the Lord,
        Har, Har, through the Guru's Teachings. This is the destiny
        which God has recorded on my forehead.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I
        meditate in remembrance on the Guru's Feet, day and night.
        The Lord, Har, Har, Har, comes to dwell in my mind. The Praise
        of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, is Excellent and Sublime in this world.
        His Praise is the sandalwood paste which I rub.  || 1 ||   The
        humble servant of the Lord is lovingly attuned to the Lord, Har,
        Har, Har; all the faithless cynics pursue him. The slanderous
        person acts in accordance with the record of his past deeds; his
        foot trips over the snake, and he is stung by its bite.  || 2
        ||   O my Lord and Master, You are the Saving Grace, the Protector
        of Your humble servants. You protect them, age after age. What
        does it matter, if a demon speaks evil? By doing so, he only gets
        frustrated.  || 3 ||   All the beings and creatures created by
        God are caught in the mouth of Death. The humble servants of the
        Lord are protected by the Lord God, Har, Har, Har; servant Nanak
        seeks His Sanctuary.  || 4 || 2 ||   KALYAAN,  FOURTH MEHL: <br>

      <p> O my mind, chant and meditate on the Master of the Universe. Through
        the Guru's Teachings, meditate on the Lord's Name,
        and be rid of all the painful residues of your sinful mistakes.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have only one tongue - I cannot
        sing His Praises. Please bless me with many, many tongues. Again
        and again, each and every instant, with all of them, I would sing
        His Glorious Praises; but even then, I would not be able to sing
        all of Your Praises, God.  || 1 ||   I am so deeply in love with
        God, my Lord and Master; I long to see God's Vision. You
        are the Great Giver of all beings and creatures; only You know
        our inner pain.  || 2 ||   If only someone would show me the Way,
        the Path of God. Tell me - what could I give him? I would
        surrender, offer and dedicate all my body and mind to him; if
        only someone would unite me in God's Union!  || 3 ||  
        The Glorious Praises of the Lord are so many and numerous; I can
        describe only a tiny bit of them. My intellect is under Your control,
        God; You are the All-powerful Lord God of servant Nanak.  || 4
        || 3 ||   KALYAAN,  FOURTH MEHL:  O my mind, chant the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, which are said to be inexpressible. Rightousness
        and Dharmic faith, success and prosperity, pleasure, the fulfillment
        of desires and liberation - all follow the humble servant
        of the Lord like a shadow.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That humble servant
        of the Lord who has such good fortune written on his forehead
        meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. In that Court, where
        God calls for the accounts, there, you shall be saved only by
        meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   I am
        stained with the filth of the mistakes of countless lifetimes,
        the pain and pollution of egotism. Showering His Mercy, the Guru
        bathed me in the Water of the Lord, and all the residues of my
        sins and mistakes were taken away.  || 2 ||   God, our Lord and
        Master, is deep within the hearts of His humble servants. They
        vibrate the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. And when that
        very last moment comes, then the Naam is our Best Friend and Protector.
        || 3 ||   Your humble servants sing Your Praises, O Lord, Har,
        Har; they chant and meditate on the Lord God, the Master of the
        Universe. O God, my Saving Grace, Lord and Master of servant Nanak,
        please save me, the sinking stone.  || 4 || 4 ||   KALYAAN,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  Only the Lord God knows my innermost thoughts. If someone
        slanders the humble servant of the Lord, God does not believe
        even a tiny bit of what he says.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So give
        up everything else, and serve the Imperishable; The Lord God,
        our Lord and Master, is the Highest of all. When you serve the
        Lord, Death cannot even see you. It comes and falls at the feet
        of those who know the Lord.  || 1 ||   Those whom my Lord and
        Master protects - a balanced wisdom comes to their ears.
        No one can equal them; their devotional worship is accepted by
        my God.  || 2 ||   So behold the Wondrous and Amazing Play of
        the Lord. In an instant, He distinguishes the genuine from the
        counterfeit. And that is why His humble servant is in bliss. Those
        of pure heart meet together, while the evil ones regret and repent.
        || 3 ||   Lord, You are the Great Giver, our All-powerful Lord
        and Master; O Lord, I beg for only one gift from You. <br>

      <p> Lord, please bless servant Nanak with Your Grace, that Your Feet
        may abide forever within my heart.  || 4 || 5 ||   KALYAAN,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  O God, Treasure of Mercy, please bless me, that I may sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord. I always place my hopes in You;
        O God, when will you take me in Your Embrace?  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I am a foolish and ignorant child; Father, please teach
        me! Your child makes mistakes again and again, but still, You
        are pleased with him, O Father of the Universe.  || 1 ||   Whatever
        You give me, O my Lord and Master - that is what I receive.
        There is no other place where I can go.  || 2 ||   Those devotees
        who are pleasing to the Lord - the Lord is pleasing to
        them. Their light merges into the Light; the lights are merged
        and blended together.  || 3 ||   The Lord Himself has shown mercy;
        He lovingly attunes me to Himself. Servant Nanak seeks the Sanctuary
        of the Door of the Lord, who protects his honor.  || 4 || 6 ||

        never again suffer pain and punishment.  || 2 || 2 || 5 ||   KALYAAN,

        O Perfect Transcendent Lord; bless me with the True Eternal Insignia
        of the Shabad, the Word of God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Lord,
        other than You, no one is all-powerful. You are the Hope and the
        Strength of my mind. You are the Giver to the hearts of all beings,
        O Lord and Master. I eat and wear whatever You give me.  || 1
        ||   Intuitive understanding, wisdom and cleverness, glory and
        beauty, pleasure, wealth and honor, all comforts, bliss, happiness
        and salvation, O Nanak, come by chanting the Lord's Name.
        || 2 || 6 || 9 ||   KALYAAN,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Sanctuary of the
        Lord's Feet bring salvation. God's Name is the Purifier
        of sinners.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whoever chants and meditates
        in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, shall undoubtedly
        escape being consumed by the Messenger of Death.  || 1 ||   Liberation,
        the key to success, and all sorts of comforts do not equal loving
        devotional worship of the Lord. Slave Nanak longs for the Blessed
        Vision of God's Darshan; he shall never again wander in
        reincarnation.  || 2 ||  || 7 || 10 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">Hearing the Name of the Lord, the All-pervading
        Lord, my mind is drenched with joy. The Name of the Lord, Har,
        Har, is Ambrosial Nectar, the most Sweet and Sublime Essence;
        through the Guru's Teachings, drink it in with intuitive
        ease.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The potential energy of fire is within
        the wood; it is released if you know how to rub it and generate
        friction. In just the same way, the Lord's Name is the
        Light within all; the Essence is extracted by following the Guru's
        Teachings.  || 1 ||   There are nine doors, but the taste of these
        nine doors is bland and insipid. The Essence of Ambrosial Nectar
        trickles down through the Tenth Door. Please take pity on me -
        be kind and compassionate, O my Beloved, that I may drink in the
        Sublime Essence of the Lord, through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad.  || 2 ||   The body-village is the most sublime and exalted
        village, in which the merchandise of the Lord's Sublime
        Essence is traded. The most precious and priceless gems and jewels
        are obtained by serving the True Guru.  || 3 ||   The True Guru
        is Inaccessible; Inaccessible is our Lord and Master. He is the
        overflowing Ocean of bliss - worship Him with loving devotion.
        Please take pity on me, and be Merciful to this meek song-bird;
        please pour a drop of Your Name into my mouth.  || 4 ||   O Beloved
        Lord, please color my mind with the Deep Crimson Color of Your
        Love; I have surrendered my mind to the Guru. Those who are imbued
        with the Love of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, continually drink
        in this essence in big gulps, savoring its sweet taste.  || 5
        ||   If all the gold of the seven continents and the oceans was
        taken out and placed before them, the humble servants of my Lord
        and Master would not even want it. They beg for the Lord to bless
        them with the Lord's Sublime Essence.  || 6 ||   The faithless
        cynics and mortal beings remain hungry forever; they continually
        cry out in hunger. They hurry and run, and wander all around,
        caught in the love of Maya; they cover hundreds of thousands of
        miles in their wanderings.  || 7 ||   The humble servants of the
        Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, are sublime and exalted. What praise
        can we bestow upon them? <br>

      <p> Nothing else can equal the Glory of the Lord's Name; please
        bless servant Nanak with Your Grace.  || 8 || 1 ||   KALYAAN,
        FOURTH MEHL:  O Lord, please bless me with the Touch of the Guru,
        the Philosopher's Stone. I was unworthy, utterly useless,
        rusty slag; meeting with the True Guru, I was transformed by the
        Philosopher's Stone.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Everyone longs
        for paradise, liberation and heaven; all place their hopes in
        them. The humble long for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; they
        do not ask for liberation. Their minds are satisfied and comforted
        by His Darshan.  || 1 ||   Emotional attachment to Maya is very
        powerful; this attachment is a black stain which sticks. The humble
        servants of my Lord and Master are unattached and liberated. They
        are like ducks, whose feathers do not get wet.  || 2 ||   The
        fragrant sandalwood tree is encircled by snakes; how can anyone
        get to the sandalwood? Drawing out the Mighty Sword of the Guru's
        Spiritual Wisdom, I slaughter and kill the poisonous snakes, and
        drink in the Sweet Nectar.  || 3 ||   You may gather wood and
        stack it in a pile, but in an instant, fire reduces it to ashes.
        The faithless cynic gathers the most horrendous sins, but meeting
        with the Holy Saint, they are placed in the fire.  || 4 ||   The
        Holy, Saintly devotees are sublime and exalted. They enshrine
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, deep within. By the touch of the
        Holy and the humble servants of the Lord, the Lord God is seen.
        || 5 ||   The thread of the faithless cynic is totally knotted
        and tangled; how can anything be woven with it? This thread cannot
        be woven into yarn; do not associate with those faithless cynics.
        || 6 ||   The True Guru and the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, are exalted and sublime. Joining the Congregation, meditate
        on the Lord. The gems, jewels and precious stones are deep within;
        by Guru's Grace, they are found.  || 7 ||   My Lord and
        Master is Glorious and Great. How can I be united in His Union?
        O Nanak, the Perfect Guru unites His humble servant in His Union,
        and blesses him with perfection.  || 8 || 2 ||   KALYAAN,  FOURTH
        MEHL:  Chant the Name of the Lord, the Lord, the All-pervading
        Lord. The Holy, the humble and Holy, are noble and sublime. Meeting
        with the Holy, I joyfully love the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  || 
        The minds of all the beings and creatures of the world waver
        unsteadily. Please take pity on them, be merciful to them, and
        unite them with the Holy; establish this support to support the
        world. The earth is beneath us, and yet its dust falls down on
        all; let yourself be covered by the dust of the feet of the Holy.
        You shall be utterly exalted, the most noble and sublime of all;
        the whole world will place itself at your feet.  || 2 ||   The
        Gurmukhs are blessed with the Divine Light of the Lord; Maya comes
        to serve them. Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings,
        they bite with teeth of wax and chew iron, drinking in the Sublime
        Essence of the Lord.  || 3 ||   The Lord has shown great mercy,
        and bestowed His Name; I have met with the Holy Guru, the Primal
        Being. The Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name have spread
        out everywhere; the Lord bestows fame all over the world.  ||
        4 ||   The Beloved Lord is within the minds of the Holy, the Holy
        Saadhus; without seeing Him, they cannot survive. The fish in
        the water loves only the water. <br>

      <p> Without water, it bursts and dies in an instant.  || 5 ||   Those
        who have terrible luck and bad fortune do not drink in the water
        which washes the dust of the feet of the Holy. The burning fire
        of their desires is not extinguished; they are beaten and punished
        by the Righteous Judge of Dharma.  || 6 ||   You may visit all
        the sacred shrines, observe fasts and sacred feasts, give generously
        in charity and waste away the body, melting it in the snow. The
        weight of the Lord's Name is unweighable, according to
        the Guru's Teachings; nothing can equal its weight.  ||
        7 ||   O God, You alone know Your Glorious Virtues. Servant Nanak
        seeks Your Sanctuary. You are the Ocean of water, and I am Your
        fish. Please be kind, and keep me always with You.   || 8 || 3
        ||   KALYAAN,  FOURTH MEHL:  I worship and adore the Lord, the
        All-pervading Lord. I surrender my mind and body, and place everything
        before Him; following the Guru's Teachings, spiritual wisdom
        is implanted within me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God's Name
        is the tree, and His Glorious Virtues are the branches. Picking
        and gathering up the fruit, I worship Him. The soul is divine;
        divine is the soul. Worship Him with love.  || 1 ||   One of keen
        intellect and precise understanding is immaculate in all this
        world. In thoughtful consideration, he drinks in the sublime essence.
        By Guru's Grace, the treasure is found; dedicate this mind
        to the True Guru.  || 2 ||   Priceless and utterly sublime is
        the Diamond of the Lord. This Diamond pierces the diamond of the
        mind. The mind becomes the jeweller, through the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad; it appraises the Diamond of the Lord.  || 3 ||   Attaching
        oneself to the Society of the Saints, one is exalted and uplifted,
        as the palaas tree is absorbed by the peepal tree. That mortal
        being is supreme among all people, who is perfumed by the fragrance
        of the Lord's Name.  || 4 ||   One who continually acts
        in goodness and immaculate purity, sprouts green branches in great
        abundance. The Guru has taught me that Dharmic faith is the flower,
        and spiritual wisdom is the fruit; this fragrance permeates the
        world.  || 5 ||   The One, the Light of the One, abides within
        my mind; God, the One, is seen in all. The One Lord, the Supreme
        Soul, is spread out everywhere; all place their heads beneath
        His Feet.  || 6 ||   Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, people
        look like criminals with their noses cut off; bit by bit, their
        noses are cut off. The faithless cynics are called egotistical;
        without the Name, their lives are cursed.  || 7 ||   As long as
        the breath breathes through the mind deep within, hurry and seek
        God's Sanctuary. Please shower Your Kind Mercy and take
        pity upon Nanak, that he may wash the feet of the Holy.  || 8
        || 4 ||   KALYAAN,  FOURTH MEHL:  O Lord, I wash the feet of the
        Holy. May the residues of my sinful mistakes be burnt away in
        an instant; O my Lord and Master, please bless me with Your Mercy.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The meek and humble beggars stand begging
        at Your Door. Please be generous and give to those who are yearning.
        Save me, save me, O God - I have come to Your Sanctuary.
        Please implant the Guru's Teachings, and the Naam within
        me.  || 1 ||   Sexual desire and anger are very powerful in the
        body-village; I rise up to fight the battle against them. Please
        make me Your Own and save me; through the Perfect Guru, I drive
        them out.  || 2 || <br>

      </p>
      <p> The powerful fire of corruption is raging violently within; the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad is the ice water which cools
        and soothes. My mind and body are calm and tranquil; the disease
        has been cured, and now I sleep in peace.  || 3 ||   As the rays
        of the sun spread out everywhere, the Lord pervades each and every
        heart. Meeting the Holy Saint, one drinks in the Sublime Essence
        of the Lord; sitting in the home of your own inner being, drink
        in the essence.  || 4 ||   The humble being is in love with the
        Guru, like the chakvi bird which loves to see the sun. She watches,
        and keeps on watching all through the night; and when the sun
        shows its face, she drinks in the Amrit.  || 5 ||   The faithless
        cynic is said to be very greedy - he is a dog. He is overflowing
        with the filth and pollution of evil-mindedness. He talks excessively
        about his own interests. How can he be trusted?  || 6 ||   I have
        sought the Sanctuary of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;
        I have found the Sublime Essence of the Lord. They do good deeds
        for others, and speak of the Lord's many Glorious Virtues;
        please bless me to meet these Saints, these devotees of the Lord.
        || 7 ||   You are the Inaccessible Lord, Kind and Compassionate,
        the Great Giver; please shower us with Your Mercy, and save us.
        You are the Life of all the beings of the world; please cherish
        and sustain Nanak.  || 8 || 5 ||   KALYAAN,  FIFTH MEHL:  O Lord,
        please make me the slave of Your slaves. As long as there is breath
        deep within my mind, let me drink in the dust of the Holy.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   Shiva, Naarad, the thousand-headed cobra king
        and the silent sages long for the dust of the Holy. All the worlds
        and realms where the Holy place their feet are sanctified.  ||
        1 ||   So let go of your shame and renounce all your egotism;
        join with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and remain
        there. Give up your fear of the Righteous Judge of Dharma, and
        you shall be lifted up and saved from drowning in the sea of poison.
        || 2 ||   Some are standing, parched and shrivelled up by their
        doubts; joining the Saadh Sangat, they are rejuvenated. So do
        not delay, even for an instant - go and fall at the feet
        of the Holy.  || 3 ||   The Kirtan of the Praise of the Lord's
        Name is a priceless jewel. The Lord has given it for the Holy
        to keep. Whoever accepts and follows the Word of the Guru's
        Teachings as True - this Jewel is taken out and given to
        him.  || 4 ||   Listen, O Saints; listen, humble Siblings of Destiny:
        the Guru raises His Arms and sends out the call. If you long for
        everlasting peace and comfort for your soul, then enter the Sanctuary
        of the True Guru.  || 5 ||   If you have great good fortune and
        are very noble, then implant the Guru's Teachings and the
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, within. Emotional attachment to Maya
        is totally treacherous; drinking in the Sublime Essence of the
        Lord, you shall easily, intuitively cross over the world-ocean.
        || 6 ||   Those who are totally in love with Maya, Maya, shall
        rot away in Maya. The path of ignorance and darkness is utterly
        treacherous; they are loaded down with the crushing load of egotism.
        || 7 ||   O Nanak, chanting the Name of the Lord, the All-pervading
        Lord, one is emancipated. Meeting the True Guru, the Naam is implanted
        within; we are united and blended with the Lord's Name.
