      <p> Why feed it by telling lies? When you leave, it does not go with
        you. The body is merely blind dust; go, and ask the soul. The
        soul answers, &quot;I am enticed by Maya, and so I come and go,
        again and again.&quot;  O Nanak, I do not know my Lord and Master's
        Command, by which I would merge in the Truth.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the only permanent wealth;
        all other wealth comes and goes. Thieves cannot steal this wealth,
        nor can robbers take it away. This wealth of the Lord is embedded
        in the soul, and with the soul, it shall depart. It is obtained
        from the Perfect Guru; the self-willed manmukhs do not receive
        it. Blessed are the traders, O Nanak, who have come to earn the
        wealth of the Naam.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  My Master is so very great,
        true, profound and unfathomable. The whole world is under His
        power; everything is the projection of Him. By Guru's Grace,
        the eternal wealth is obtained, bringing peace and patience to
        the mind. By His Grace, the Lord dwells in the mind, and one meets
        the Brave Guru. The virtuous praise the ever-stable, permanent,
        perfect Lord.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Cursed is the life
        of those who forsake and throw away the peace of the Lord's
        Name, and suffer pain instead by practicing ego and sin. The ignorant
        self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in the love of Maya; they have
        no understanding at all. In this world and in the world beyond,
        they do not find peace; in the end, they depart regretting and
        repenting. By Guru's Grace, one may meditate on the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, and egotism departs from within him. O Nanak,
        one who has such pre-ordained destiny, comes and falls at the
        Guru's Feet.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The self-willed manmukh
        is like the inverted lotus; he has neither devotional worship,
        nor the Lord's Name. He remains engrossed in material wealth,
        and his efforts are false. His consciousness is not softened within,
        and the words from his mouth are insipid. He does not mingle with
        the righteous; within him are falsehood and selfishness. O Nanak,
        the Creator Lord has arranged things, so that the self-willed
        manmukhs are drowned by telling lies, while the Gurmukhs are saved
        by chanting the Lord's Name.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Without
        understanding, one must wander around the cycle of reincarnation,
        and continue coming and going. One who has not served the True
        Guru, shall depart regretting and repenting in the end. But if
        the Lord shows His Mercy, one finds the Guru, and ego is banished
        from within. Hunger and thirst depart from within, and peace comes
        to dwell in the mind. Forever and ever, praise Him with love in
        your heart.  || 8 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  One who serves his
        True Guru, is worshipped by everyone. Of all efforts, the supreme
        effort is the attainment of the Lord's Name. Peace and tranquility
        come to dwell within the mind; meditating within the heart, there
        comes a lasting peace. The Ambrosial Amrit is his food, and the
        Ambrosial Amrit is his clothes; O Nanak, through the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, greatness is obtained.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        O mind, listen to the Guru's Teachings, and you shall obtain
        the treasure of virtue. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p> The Lord, the Giver of peace, shall dwell in your mind, and your
        egotism and pride shall depart. O Nanak, when the Lord bestows
        His Glance of Grace, then, night and day, one centers his meditation
        on the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Gurmukh is totally truthful,
        content and pure. Deception and wickedness have departed from
        within him, and he easily conquers his mind. There, the Divine
        Light and the essence of bliss are manifest, and ignorance is
        eliminated. Night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord, and manifests the excellence of the Lord. The One Lord is
        the Giver of all; the Lord alone is our friend.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  One who understands God, who lovingly centers his
        mind on the Lord night and day, is called a Brahmin. Consulting
        the True Guru, he practices Truth and self-restraint, and he is
        rid of the disease of ego. He sings the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord, and gathers in His Praises; his light is blended with the
        Light. In this world, one who knows God is very rare; eradicating
        ego, he is absorbed in God. O Nanak, meeting him, peace is obtained;
        night and day, he meditates on the Lord's Name.  || 1 ||
        THIRD MEHL:  Within the ignorant self-willed manmukh is deception;
        with his tongue, he speaks lies. Practicing deception, he does
        not please the Lord God, who always sees and hears with natural
        ease. In the love of duality, he goes to instruct the world, but
        he is engrossed in the poison of Maya and attachment to pleasure.
        By doing so, he suffers in constant pain; he is born and then
        dies, and comes and goes again and again. His doubts do not leave
        him at all, and he rots away in manure. One, unto whom my Lord
        Master shows His Mercy, listens to the Guru's Teachings.
        He meditates on the Lord's Name, and sings the Lord's
        Name; in the end, the Lord's Name will deliver him.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  Those who obey the Hukam of the Lord's Command,
        are the perfect persons in the world. They serve their Lord Master,
        and reflect upon the Perfect Word of the Shabad. They serve the
        Lord, and love the True Word of the Shabad. They attain the Mansion
        of the Lord's Presence, as they eradicate egotism from within.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukhs remain united with Him, chanting the Name
        of the Lord, and enshrining it within their hearts.  || 10 ||
        SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukh meditates on the Lord; the
        celestial sound-current resounds within him, and he focuses his
        consciousness on the True Name. The Gurmukh remains imbued with
        the Lord's Love, night and day; his mind is pleased with
        the Name of the Lord. The Gurmukh beholds the Lord, the Gurmukh
        speaks of the Lord, and the Gurmukh naturally loves the Lord.
        O Nanak, the Gurmukh attains spiritual wisdom, and the pitch-black
        darkness of ignorance is dispelled. One who is blessed by the
        Perfect Lord's Grace  -  as Gurmukh, he meditates on the
        Lord's Name.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Those who do not serve
        the True Guru do not embrace love for the Word of the Shabad.
        They do not meditate on the Celestial Naam, the Name of the Lord
        -  why did they even bother to come into the world? Time and
        time again, they are reincarnated, and they rot away forever in
        manure. They are attached to false greed; they are not on this
        shore, nor on the one beyond. </p>

      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved; the Creator Lord unites them
        with Himself.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The devotees look beauteous
        in the True Court of the Lord; they abide in the True Word of
        the Shabad. The Lord's Love wells up in them; they are attracted
        by the Lord's Love. They abide in the Lord's Love, they
        remain imbued with the Lord's Love forever, and with their
        tongues, they drink in the sublime essence of the Lord. Fruitful
        are the lives of those Gurmukhs who recognize the Lord and enshrine
        Him in their hearts. Without the Guru, they wander around crying
        out in misery; in the love of duality, they are ruined.  || 11
        ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the devotees
        earn the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they obtain
        the supreme status of the Lord. Serving the True Guru, they enshrine
        the Lord's Name in their minds, and they meditate on the
        Naam, night and day. Within the home of their own selves, they
        remain unattached, through the Guru's Teachings; they burn away
        egotism and emotional attachment. They save themselves, and they
        save the whole world. Blessed are the mothers who gave birth to
        them. He alone finds such a True Guru, upon whose forehead the
        Lord inscribed such pre-ordained destiny. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice
        to his Guru; when he was wandering in doubt, He placed him on
        the Path.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Beholding Maya with her three
        dispositions, he goes astray; he is like the moth, which sees
        the flame, and is consumed. The mistaken, deluded Pandits gaze
        upon Maya, and watch to see whether anyone has offered them something.
        In the love of duality, they read continually about sin, while
        the Lord has withheld His Name from them. The Yogis, the wandering
        hermits and the Sannyaasees have gone astray; their egotism and
        arrogance have increased greatly. They do not accept the true
        donations of clothes and food, and their lives are ruined by their
        stubborn minds. Among these, he alone is a man of poise, who,
        as Gurmukh, meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Unto
        whom should servant Nanak speak and complain? All act as the Lord
        causes them to act.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Emotional attachment to
        Maya, sexual desire, anger and egotism are demons. Because of
        them, mortals are subject to death; above their heads hangs the
        heavy club of the Messenger of Death. The self-willed manmukhs,
        in love with duality, are led onto the path of Death. In the City
        of Death, they are tied up and beaten, and no one hears their
        cries. One who is blessed by the Lord's Grace meets the Guru;
        as Gurmukh, he is emancipated.  || 12 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:
        By egotism and pride, the self-willed manmukhs are enticed, and
        consumed. Those who center their consciousness on duality are
        caught in it, and remain stuck. But when it is burnt away by the
        Word of the Guru's Shabad, only then does it depart from
        within. The body and mind become radiant and bright, and the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind. O Nanak,
        the Lord's Name is the antidote to Maya; the Gurmukh obtains
        it.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  This mind has wandered through so
        many ages; it has not remained stable  -  it continues coming
        and going. When it is pleasing to the Lord's Will, then He
        causes the soul to wander; He has set the world-drama in motion. </p>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> When the Lord forgives, then one meets the Guru, and becoming
        stable, he remains absorbed in the Lord. O Nanak, through the
        mind, the mind is satisfied, and then, nothing comes or goes.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The body is the fortress of the Infinite Lord;
        it is obtained only by destiny. The Lord Himself dwells within
        the body; He Himself is the Enjoyer of pleasures. He Himself remains
        detached and unaffected; while unattached, He is still attached.
        He does whatever He pleases, and whatever He does, comes to pass.
        The Gurmukh meditates on the Lord's Name, and separation
        from the Lord is ended.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Waaho!
        Waaho! The Lord Himself causes us to praise Him, through the True
        Word of the Guru's Shabad. Waaho! Waaho! is His Eulogy and
        Praise; how rare are the Gurmukhs who understand this. Waaho!
        Waaho! is the True Word of His Bani, by which we meet our True
        Lord. O Nanak, chanting Waaho! Waaho! God is attained; by His
        Grace, He is obtained.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Chanting Waaho!
        Waaho! the tongue is adorned with the Word of the Shabad. Through
        the Perfect Shabad, one comes to meet God. How very fortunate
        are those, who with their mouths, chant Waaho! Waaho! How beautiful
        are those persons who chant Waaho! Waaho! and worship the Lord
        in adoration. Waaho! Waaho! is obtained by His Grace; O Nanak,
        honor is obtained at the Gate of the True Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Within the fortress of body, are the hard and rigid doors of
        falsehood, deception and pride. Deluded by doubt, the blind and
        ignorant self-willed manmukhs cannot see them. They cannot be
        found by any efforts; wearing their religious robes, the wearers
        have grown weary of trying. The doors are opened only by the Word
        of the Guru's Shabad, and then, one chants the Name of the
        Lord. The Dear Lord is the Tree of Ambrosial Nectar; those who
        drink in this Nectar are satisfied.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  Chanting Waaho! Waaho! the night of one's life passes
        in peace. Chanting Waaho! Waaho! I am in eternal bliss, O my mother!
        Chanting Waaho! Waaho!, I have fallen in love with the Lord. Waaho!
        Waaho! Through the karma of good deeds, I chant it, and inspire
        others to chant it as well. Chanting Waaho! Waaho!, one obtains
        honor. O Nanak, Waaho! Waaho! is the Will of the True Lord.  ||
        1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Waaho! Waaho! is the Bani of the True Word.
        Searching, the Gurmukhs have found it. Waaho! Waaho! They chant
        the Word of the Shabad. Waaho! Waaho! They enshrine it in their
        hearts. Chanting Waaho! Waaho! the Gurmukhs easily obtain the
        Lord, after searching. O Nanak, very fortunate are those who reflect
        upon the Lord, Har, Har, within their hearts.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        O my utterly greedy mind, you are constantly engrossed in greed.
        In your desire for the enticing Maya, you wander in the ten directions.
        Your name and social status shall not go with you hereafter; the
        self-willed manmukh is consumed by pain. Your tongue does not
        taste the sublime essence of the Lord; it utters only insipid
        words. Those Gurmukhs who drink in the Ambrosial Nectar are satisfied.
        || 15 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Chant Waaho! Waaho! to the Lord,
        who is True, profound and unfathomable. Chant Waaho! Waaho! to
        the Lord, who is the Giver of virtue, intelligence and patience. </p>

      <p> Chant Waaho! Waaho! to the Lord, who is permeating and pervading
        in all. Chant Waaho! Waaho! to the Lord, who is the Giver of sustenance
        to all. O Nanak, Waaho! Waaho!  -  praise the One Lord, revealed
        by the True Guru.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Waaho! Waaho! The Gurmukhs
        praise the Lord continually, while the self-willed manmukhs eat
        poison and die. They have no love for the Lord's Praises,
        and they pass their lives in misery. The Gurmukhs drink in the
        Ambrosial Nectar, and they center their consciousness on the Lord's
        Praises. O Nanak, those who chant Waaho! Waaho! are immaculate
        and pure; they obtain the knowledge of the three worlds.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  By the Lord's Will, one meets the Guru, serves
        Him, and worships the Lord. By the Lord's Will, the Lord
        comes to dwell in the mind, and one easily drinks in the sublime
        essence of the Lord. By the Lord's Will, one finds peace,
        and continually earns the Lord's Profit. He is seated on
        the Lord's throne, and he dwells continually in the home
        of his own being. He alone surrenders to the Lord's Will,
        who meets the Guru.  || 16 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Waaho! Waaho!
        Those humble beings ever praise the Lord, unto whom the Lord Himself
        grants understanding. Chanting Waaho! Waaho!, the mind is purified,
        and egotism departs from within. The Gurmukh who continually chants
        Waaho! Waaho! attains the fruits of his heart's desires.
        Beauteous are those humble beings who chant Waaho! Waaho! O Lord,
        let me join them! Within my heart, I chant Waaho! Waaho!, and
        with my mouth, Waaho! Waaho! O Nanak, those who chant Waaho! Waaho!
        -  unto them I dedicate my body and mind.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  Waaho! Waaho! is the True Lord Master; His Name is Ambrosial
        Nectar. Those who serve the Lord are blessed with the fruit; I
        am a sacrifice to them. Waaho! Waaho! is the treasure of virtue;
        he alone tastes it, who is so blessed. Waaho! Waaho! The Lord
        is pervading and permeating the oceans and the land; the Gurmukh
        attains Him. Waaho! Waaho! Let all the Gursikhs continually praise
        Him. Waaho! Waaho! The Perfect Guru is pleased with His Praises.
        O Nanak, one who chants Waaho! Waaho! with his heart and mind
        -  the Messenger of Death does not approach him.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  The Dear Lord is the Truest of the True; True is the
        Word of the Guru's Bani. Through the True Guru, the Truth
        is realized, and one is easily absorbed in the True Lord. Night
        and day, they remain awake, and do not sleep; in wakefulness,
        the night of their lives passes. Those who taste the sublime essence
        of the Lord, through the Guru's Teachings, are the most worthy
        persons. Without the Guru, no one has obtained the Lord; the ignorant
        rot away and die.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Waaho! Waaho!
        is the Bani, the Word, of the Formless Lord. There is no other
        as great as He is. Waaho! Waaho! The Lord is unfathomable and
        inaccessible. Waaho! Waaho! He is the True One. Waaho! Waaho!
        He is the self-existent Lord. Waaho! Waaho! As He wills, so it
        comes to pass. Waaho! Waaho! is the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, obtained by the Gurmukh. </p>

      <p> Waaho! Waaho! This is realized by His Grace, as He Himself grants
        His Grace. O Nanak, Waaho! Waaho! This is obtained by the Gurmukhs,
        who hold tight to the Naam, night and day.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        Without serving the True Guru, peace is not obtained, and the
        sense of duality does not depart. No matter how much one may wish,
        without the Lord's Grace, He is not found. Those who are
        filled with greed and corruption are ruined by the love of duality.
        They cannot escape birth and death, and with egotism within them,
        they suffer in misery. Those who center their consciousness on
        the True Guru, never go empty-handed. They are not summoned by
        the Messenger of Death, and they do not suffer in pain. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukhs are saved; they merge in the True Lord.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  He alone is called a minstrel, who enshrines love for
        his Lord and Master. Standing at the Lord's Door, he serves
        the Lord, and reflects upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        The minstrel attains the Lord's Gate and Mansion, and he
        keeps the True Lord clasped to his heart. The status of the minstrel
        is exalted; he loves the Name of the Lord. The service of the
        minstrel is to meditate on the Lord; he is emancipated by the
        Lord.  || 18 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The milkmaid's status
        is very low, but she attains her Husband Lord when she reflects
        upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and chants the Lord's
        Name, night and day. She who meets the True Guru, lives in the
        Fear of God; she is a woman of noble birth. She alone realizes
        the Hukam of her Husband Lord's Command, who is blessed by
        the Creator Lord's Mercy. She who is of little merit and
        ill-mannered, is discarded and forsaken by her Husband Lord. By
        the Fear of God, filth is washed off, and the body becomes immaculately
        pure. The soul is enlightened, and the intellect is exalted, meditating
        on the Lord, the ocean of excellence. One who dwells in the Fear
        of God, lives in the Fear of God, and acts in the Fear of God.
        He obtains peace and glorious greatness here, in the Lord's
        Court, and at the Gate of Salvation. Through the Fear of God,
        the Fearless Lord is obtained, and one's light merges in
        the Infinite Light. O Nanak, that bride alone is good, who is
        pleasing to her Lord and Master, and whom the Creator Lord Himself
        forgives.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Praise the Lord, forever and
        ever, and make yourself a sacrifice to the True Lord. O Nanak,
        let that tongue be burnt, which renounces the One Lord, and attaches
        itself to another.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  From a single particle
        of His greatness, He created His incarnations, but they indulged
        in the love of duality. They ruled like kings, and fought for
        pleasure and pain. Those who serve Shiva and Brahma do not find
        the limits of the Lord. The Fearless, Formless Lord is unseen
        and invisible; He is revealed only to the Gurmukh. There, one
        does not suffer sorrow or separation; he becomes stable and immortal
        in the world.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  All these things
        come and go, all these things of the world. One who knows this
        written account is acceptable and approved. O Nanak, anyone who
        takes pride in himself is foolish and unwise.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  The mind is the elephant, the Guru is the elephant-driver,
        and knowledge is the whip. Wherever the Guru drives the mind,
        it goes. O Nanak, without the whip, the elephant wanders into
        the wilderness, again and again.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  I offer my
        prayer to the One, from whom I was created. </p>

      <p> Serving my True Guru, I have obtained all the fruits. I meditate
        continually on the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. In the Society
        of the Saints, I am rid of my pain and suffering. O Nanak, I have
        become care-free; I have obtained the imperishable wealth of the
        Lord.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Raising the embankments
        of the mind's field, I gaze at the heavenly mansion. When
        devotion comes to the mind of the soul-bride, she is visited by
        the friendly guest. O clouds, if you are going to rain, then go
        ahead and rain; why rain after the season has passed? Nanak is
        a sacrifice to those Gurmukhs who obtain the Lord in their minds.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  That which is pleasing is sweet, and one
        who is sincere is a friend. O Nanak, he is known as a Gurmukh,
        whom the Lord Himself enlightens.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O God, Your
        humble servant offers his prayer to You; You are my True Master.
        You are my Protector, forever and ever; I meditate on You. All
        the beings and creatures are Yours; You are pervading and permeating
        in them. One who slanders Your slave is crushed and destroyed.
        Falling at Your Feet, Nanak has renounced his cares, and has become
        care-free.  || 21 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Building up its hopes,
        the world dies, but its hopes do not die or depart. O Nanak, hopes
        are fulfilled only by attaching one's consciousness to the
        True Lord.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Hopes and desires shall die
        only when He, who created them, takes them away. O Nanak, nothing
        is permanent, except the Name of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        He Himself created the world, with His perfect workmanship. He
        Himself is the true banker, He Himself is the merchant, and He
        Himself is the store. He Himself is the ocean, He Himself is the
        boat, and He Himself is the boatman. He Himself is the Guru, He
        Himself is the disciple, and He Himself shows the destination.
        O servant Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and
        all your sins shall be eradicated.  || 22 || 1 ||  SUDH  || </p>

        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Deep within yourself, worship the Guru in
        adoration, and with your tongue, chant the Guru's Name. Let
        your eyes behold the True Guru, and let your ears hear the Guru's
        Name. Attuned to the True Guru, you shall receive a place of honor
        in the Court of the Lord. Says Nanak, this treasure is bestowed
        on those who are blessed with His Mercy. In the midst of the world,
        they are known as the most pious  -  they are rare indeed.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  O Savior Lord, save us and take us across.
        Falling at the feet of the Guru, our works are embellished with
        perfection. You have become kind, merciful and compassionate;
        we do not forget You from our minds. In the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy, we are carried across the terrifying world-ocean.
        In an instant, You have destroyed the faithless cynics and slanderous
        enemies. That Lord and Master is my Anchor and Support; O Nanak,
        hold firm in your mind. </p>

      <p> Remembering Him in meditation, happiness comes, and all sorrows
        and pains simply vanish.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He is without relatives,
        immaculate, all-powerful, unapproachable and infinite. Truly,
        the True Lord is seen to be the Truest of the True. Nothing established
        by You appears to be false. The Great Giver gives sustenance to
        all those He has created. He has strung all on only one thread;
        He has infused His Light in them. By His Will, some drown in the
        terrifying world-ocean, and by His Will, some are carried across.
        O Dear Lord, he alone meditates on You, upon whose forehead such
        blessed destiny is inscribed. Your condition and state cannot
        be known; I am a sacrifice to You.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:
        When You are pleased, O Merciful Lord, you automatically come
        to dwell within my mind. When You are pleased, O Merciful Lord,
        I find the nine treasures within the home of my own self. When
        You are pleased, O Merciful Lord, I act according to the Guru's
        Instructions. When You are pleased, O Merciful Lord, then Nanak
        is absorbed in the True One.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Many sit
        on thrones, to the sounds of musical instruments. O Nanak, without
        the True Name, no one's honor is safe.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        The followers of the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran, standing
        at Your Door, meditate on You. Uncounted are those who fall at
        Your Door. Brahma meditates on You, as does Indra on his throne.
        Shiva and Vishnu, and their incarnations, chant the Lord's
        Praise with their mouths, as do the Pirs, the spiritual teachers,
        the prophets and the Shaykhs, the silent sages and the seers.
        Through and through, the Formless Lord is woven into each and
        every heart. One is destroyed through falsehood; through righteousness,
        one prospers. Whatever the Lord links him to, to that he is linked.
        || 2 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  He is reluctant to do good, but
        eager to practice evil. O Nanak, today or tomorrow, the feet of
        the careless fool shall fall into the trap.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        No matter how evil my ways are, still, Your Love for me is not
        concealed. Nanak: You, O Lord, conceal my short-comings and dwell
        within my mind; You are my true friend.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  I
        beg of You, O Merciful Lord: please, make me the slave of Your
        slaves. I obtain the nine treasures and royalty; chanting Your
        Name, I live. The great ambrosial treasure, the Nectar of the
        Naam, is in the home of the Lord's slaves. In their company,
        I am in ecstasy, listening to Your Praises with my ears. Serving
        them, my body is purified. I wave the fans over them, and carry
        water for them; I grind the corn for them, and washing their feet,
        I am over-joyed. By myself, I can do nothing; O God, bless me
        with Your Glance of Grace. I am worthless  -  please, bless
        me with a seat in the place of worship of the Saints.  || 3 ||
        SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  O Friend, I pray that I may remain forever
        the dust of Your Feet. Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, and beholds
        You ever-present.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Countless sinners become
        pure, by fixing their minds on the Feet of the Lord. The Name
        of God is the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, O Nanak,
        for one who has such destiny written upon his forehead.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  With every breath and morsel of food, chant the
        Name of the Lord, the Cherisher. The Lord does not forget one
        upon whom He has bestowed His Grace. He Himself is the Creator,
        and He Himself destroys. </p>

      <p> The Knower knows everything; He understands and contemplates.
        By His creative power, He assumes numerous forms in an instant.
        One whom the Lord attaches to the Truth is redeemed. One who has
        God on his side is never conquered. His Court is eternal and imperishable;
        I humbly bow to Him.  || 4 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Renounce
        sexual desire, anger and greed, and burn them in the fire. As
        long as you are alive, O Nanak, meditate continually on the True
        Name.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Meditating, meditating in remembrance
        on my God, I have obtained all the fruits. O Nanak, I worship
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Perfect Guru has united me
        with the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  One who has been instructed
        by the Guru is liberated in this world. He avoids disaster, and
        his anxiety is dispelled. Beholding the blessed vision of his
        Darshan, the world is over-joyed. In the company of the Lord's
        humble servants, the world is over-joyed, and the filth of sin
        is washed away. There, they meditate on the Ambrosial Nectar of
        the True Name.  The mind becomes content, and its hunger is satisfied.
        One whose heart is filled with the Name, has his bonds cut away.
        By Guru's Grace, some rare person earns the wealth of the
        Lord's Name.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Within my mind,
        I think thoughts of always rising early, and making the effort.
        O Lord, my Friend, please bless Nanak with the habit of singing
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        Casting His Glance of Grace, God has saved me; my mind and body
        are imbued with the Primal Being. O Nanak, those who are pleasing
        to God, have their cries of suffering taken away.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        When your soul is feeling sad, offer your prayers to the Guru.
        Renounce all your cleverness, and dedicate your mind and body
        to Him. Worship the Feet of the Guru, and your evil-mindedness
        shall be burnt away. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
        the Holy, you shall cross over the terrifying and difficult world-ocean.
        Serve the True Guru, and in the world hereafter, you shall not
        die of fear. In an instant, he shall make you happy, and the empty
        vessel shall be filled to overflowing. The mind becomes content,
        meditating forever on the Lord. He alone dedicates himself to
        the Guru's service, unto whom the Lord has granted His Grace.
        || 6 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  I am attached to the right place;
        the Uniter has united me. O Nanak, there are hundreds and thousands
        of waves, but my Husband Lord does not let me drown.  || 1 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  In the dreadful wilderness, I have found the one
        and only companion; the Name of the Lord is the Destroyer of distress.
        I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Beloved Saints, O Nanak;
        through them, my affairs have been brought to fulfillment.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  All treasures are obtained, when we are attuned
        to Your Love. One does not have to suffer regret and repentance,
        when he meditates on You. No one can equal Your humble servant,
        who has Your Support. Waaho! Waaho! How wonderful is the Perfect
        Guru! Cherishing Him in my mind, I obtain peace. The treasure
        of the Lord's Praise comes from the Guru; by His Mercy, it
        is obtained. When the True Guru bestows His Glance of Grace, one
        does not wander any more. The Merciful Lord preserves him  - 
        He makes him His own slave. </p>

        live.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  O Husband Lord, You have
        given me the silk gown of Your Love to cover and protect my honor.
        You are all-wise and all-knowing, O my Master; Nanak: I have not
        appreciated Your value, Lord.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  By Your
        meditative remembrance, I have found everything; nothing seems
        difficult to me. One whose honor the True Lord Master has preserved
        -  O Nanak, no one can dishonor him.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Meditating
        on the Lord, there comes a great peace. Multitudes of illnesses
        vanish, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Utter peace
        pervades within, when God comes to mind. One's hopes are
        fulfilled, when one's mind is filled with the Name. No obstacles
        stand in the way, when one eliminates his self-conceit. The intellect
        attains the blessing of spiritual wisdom from the Guru. He receives
        everything, unto whom the Lord Himself gives. You are the Lord
        and Master of all; all are under Your Protection.  || 8 ||   SHALOK,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Crossing the stream, my foot does not get stuck
        -  I am filled with love for You. O Lord, my heart is attached
        to Your Feet; the Lord is Nanak's raft and boat.  || 1 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  The sight of them banishes my evil-mindedness;
        they are my only true friends. I have searched the whole world;
        O servant Nanak, how rare are such persons!  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        You come to mind, O Lord and Master, when I behold Your devotees.
        The filth of my mind is removed, when I dwell in the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy. The fear of birth and death is dispelled,
        meditating on the Word of His humble servant. The Saints untie
        the bonds, and all the demons are dispelled. They inspire us to
        love Him, the One who established the entire universe. The seat
        of the inaccessible and infinite Lord is the highest of the high.
        Night and day, with your palms pressed together, with each and
        every breath, meditate on Him. When the Lord Himself becomes merciful,
        then we attain the Society of His devotees.  || 9 ||   SHALOK,
        FIFTH MEHL:  In this wondrous forest of the world, there is chaos
        and confusion; shrieks emanate from the highways. I am in love
        with You, O my Husband Lord; O Nanak, I cross the jungle joyfully.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The true society is the company of those
        who meditate on the Name of the Lord. Do not associate with those,
        O Nanak, who look out only for their own interests.  || 2 || 
        PAUREE:  Approved is that time, when one meets the True Guru.
        Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he does not
        suffer pain again. When he attains the eternal place, he does
        not have to enter the womb again. He comes to see the One God
        everywhere. He focuses his meditation on the essence of spiritual
        wisdom, and withdraws his attention from other sights. All chants
        are chanted by one who chants them with his mouth. Realizing the
        Hukam of the Lord's Command, he becomes happy, and he is
        filled with peace and tranquility. Those who are assayed, and
        placed in the Lord's treasury, are not declared counterfeit
        again.  || 10 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  The pincers of separation
        are so painful to endure. If only the Master would come to meet
        me! O Nanak, I would then obtain all the true comforts.  || 1

        in the wood. O Nanak, yearn for that Lord, who is the Support
        of all.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The works which You have done, O Lord,
        could only have been performed by You. That alone happens in the
        world, which You, O Master, have done. I am wonderstruck beholding
        the wonder of Your Almighty Creative Power. I seek Your Sanctuary
        -  I am Your slave; if it is Your Will, I shall be emancipated.
        The treasure is in Your Hands; according to Your Will, You bestow
        it. One, upon whom You have bestowed Your Mercy, is blessed with
        the Lord's Name. You are unapproachable, unfathomable and
        infinite; Your limits cannot be found. One, unto whom You have
        been compassionate, meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 11 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  The ladles cruise through the
        food, but they do not know the taste of it. I long to see the
        faces of those, O Nanak, who are imbued with the essence of the
        Lord's Love.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Through the Tracker,
        I discovered the tracks of those who ruined my crops. You, O Lord,
        have put up the fence; O Nanak, my fields shall not be plundered
        again.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Worship in adoration that True Lord;
        everything is under His Power. He Himself is the Master of both
        ends; in an instant, He adjusts our affairs. Renounce all your
        efforts, and hold fast to His Support. Run to His Sanctuary, and
        you shall obtain the comfort of all comforts. The karma of good
        deeds, the righteousness of Dharma and the essence of spiritual
        wisdom are obtained in the Society of the Saints. Chanting the
        Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, no obstacle shall block your way.
        The Lord abides in the mind of one who is blessed by His Kindness.
        All treasures are obtained, when the Lord and Master is pleased.
        || 12 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have found the object of my
        search  -  my Beloved took pity on me. There is One Creator;
        O Nanak, I do not see any other.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Take
        aim with the arrow of Truth, and shoot down sin. Cherish the Words
        of the Guru's Mantra, O Nanak, and you shall not suffer in
        pain.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Waaho! Waaho! The Creator Lord Himself
        has brought about peace and tranquility. He is Kind to all beings
        and creatures; meditate forever on Him. The all-powerful Lord
        has shown Mercy, and my cries of suffering are ended. My fevers,
        pains and diseases are gone, by the Grace of the Perfect Guru.
        The Lord has established me, and protected me; He is the Cherisher
        of the poor. He Himself has delivered me, breaking all my bonds.
        My thirst is quenched, my hopes are fulfilled, and my mind is
        contented and satisfied. The greatest of the great, the Infinite
        Lord and Master  -  He is not affected by virtue and vice.
        || 13 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  They alone meditate on the Lord
        God, Har, Har, unto whom the Lord is Merciful. O Nanak, they enshrine
        love for the Lord, meeting the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Contemplate the Lord, O very fortunate
        ones; He is pervading in the water, the land and the sky. O Nanak,
        worshipping the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mortal encounters
        no misfortune.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The speech of the devotees
        is approved; it is accepted in the Court of the Lord. Your devotees
        take to Your Support; they are imbued with the True Name. <br>
