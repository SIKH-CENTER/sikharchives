      <p> Beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, Nanak has blossomed
        forth; the Lord has united him in Union.  || 4 || 5 || 8 ||  
        SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Eternal and immovable is the City of God
        and Guru; chanting His Name, I have found peace. I have obtained
        the fruits of my mind's desires; the Creator Himself established
        it. The Creator Himself established it. I have found total peace;
        my children, siblings and Sikhs have all blossomed forth in bliss.
        Singing the Glorious Praises of the Perfect Transcendent Lord,
        my affairs have come to be resolved. God Himself is my Lord and
        Master. He Himself is my Saving Grace; He Himself is my father
        and mother. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who
        has embellished and adorned this place.  || 1 ||   Homes, mansions,
        stores and markets are beautiful, when the Lord's Name
        abides within. The Saints and devotees worship the Lord's
        Name in adoration, and the noose of Death is cut away. The noose
        of Death is cut away, meditating on the Name of the Eternal, Unchanging
        Lord, Har, Har. Everything is perfect for them, and they obtain
        the fruits of their mind's desires. The Saints and friends
        enjoy peace and pleasure; their pain, suffering and doubts are
        dispelled. The Perfect True Guru has embellished them with the
        Word of the Shabad; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to them.  ||
        2 ||   The gift of our Lord and Master is perfect; it increases
        day by day. The Supreme Lord God has made me His own; His Glorious
        Greatness is so great! From the very beginning, and throughout
        the ages, He is the Protector of His devotees; God has become
        merciful to me. All beings and creatures now dwell in peace; God
        Himself cherishes and cares for them. The Praises of the Lord
        and Master are totally pervading in the ten directions; I cannot
        express His worth. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the True Guru,
        who has laid this eternal foundation.  || 3 ||   The spiritual
        wisdom and meditation of the Perfect Transcendent Lord, and the
        Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, are continually heard there. The
        devotees of the Lord, the Destroyer of fear, play endlessly there,
        and the unstruck melody resounds and vibrates there. The unstruck
        melody resounds and resonates, and the Saints contemplate the
        essence of reality; this discourse is their daily routine. They
        worship the Lord's Name, and all their filth is washed
        away; they rid themselves of all sinful residues. There is no
        birth or death there, no coming or going, and no entering into
        the womb of reincarnation again. Nanak has found the Guru, the
        Transcendent Lord; by His Grace, desires are fulfilled.  || 4
        || 6 || 9 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord Himself has stood
        up to resolve the affairs of the Saints; He has come to complete
        their tasks. The land is beautiful, and the pool is beautiful;
        within it is contained the Ambrosial Water. The Ambrosial Water
        is filling it, and my job is perfectly complete; all my desires
        are fulfilled. Congratulations are pouring in from all over the
        world; all my sorrows are eliminated. The Vedas and the Puraanas
        sing the Praises of the Perfect, Unchanging, Imperishable Primal
        Lord.The Transcendent Lord has kept His promise, and confirmed
        His nature; Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 1 ||   The Creator has given me the nine treasures, wealth
        and spiritual powers, and I do not lack anything. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Eating, spending and enjoying, I have found peace; the gifts of
        the Creator Lord continually increase. His gifts increase and
        shall never be exhausted; I have found the Inner-knower, the Searcher
        of hearts. Millions of obstacles have all been removed, and pain
        does not even approach me. Tranquility, peace, poise and bliss
        in abundance prevail, and all my hunger is satisfied. Nanak sings
        the Glorious Praises of his Lord and Master, whose Glorious Greatness
        is wonderful and amazing.  || 2 ||   It was His job, and He has
        done it; what can the mere mortal being do? The devotees are adorned,
        singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; they proclaim His eternal
        victory. Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe,
        bliss wells up, and we are friends with the Saadh Sangat, the
        Company of the Holy. He who made the effort to construct this
        sacred pool - how can his praises be recounted? The merits
        of the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, charity, good
        deeds and immaculate lifestyle, are found in this sacred pool.
        It is the natural way of the Lord and Master to purify sinners;
        Nanak takes the Support of the Word of the Shabad.  || 3 ||  
        The treasure of virtue is my God, the Creator Lord; what Praises
        of Yours should I sing, O Lord? The prayer of the Saints is, &quot;O
        Lord and Master, please bless us with the supreme, sublime essence
        of Your Name.&quot; Please, grant us Your Name, grant us this
        blessing, and do not forget us, even for an instant. Chant the
        Glorious Praises of the World-Lord, O my tongue; sing them forever,
        night and day. One who enshrines love for the Naam, the Name of
        the Lord, his mind and body are drenched with Ambrosial Nectar.
        Prays Nanak, my desires have been fulfilled; gazing upon the Blessed
        Vision of the Lord, I live.  || 4 || 7 || 10 || <br>

      <p> <font color="#000000">My Dear Lord and Master, my Friend, speaks
        so sweetly. I have grown weary of testing Him, but still, He never
        speaks harshly to me. He does not know any bitter words; the Perfect
        Lord God does not even consider my faults and demerits. It is
        the Lord's natural way to purify sinners; He does not overlook
        even an iota of service. He dwells in each and every heart, pervading
        everywhere; He is the nearest of the near. Slave Nanak seeks His
        Sanctuary forever; the Lord is my Ambrosial Friend.  || 1 || 
        I am wonder-struck, gazing upon the incomparable Blessed Vision
        of the Lord's Darshan. My Dear Lord and Master is so beautiful;
        I am the dust of His Lotus Feet. Gazing upon God, I live, and
        I am at peace; no one else is as great as He is. Meditating on
        His Lotus Feet, I have crossed over the sea, the terrifying world-ocean.
        Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Perfect Transcendent Lord; You
        have no end or limitation, Lord.  || 2 ||   I shall not forsake,
        even for an instant, my Dear Beloved Lord, the Support of the
        breath of life. The Guru, the True Guru, has instructed me in
        the contemplation of the True, Inaccessible Lord. Meeting with
        the humble, Holy Saint, I obtained the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
        and the pains of birth and death left me. <br>

      <p> I have been blessed with peace, poise and abundant bliss, and
        the knot of egotism has been untied. He is inside all, and outside
        of all; He is untouched by love or hate. Slave Nanak has entered
        the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe; the Beloved Lord is
        the Support of the mind.  || 3 ||   I searched and searched, and
        found the immovable, unchanging home of the Lord. I have seen
        that everything is transitory and perishable, and so I have linked
        my consciousness to the Lotus Feet of the Lord. God is eternal
        and unchanging, and I am just His hand-maiden; He does not die,
        or come and go in reincarnation. He is overflowing with Dharmic
        faith, wealth and success; He fulfills the desires of the mind.
        The Vedas and the Simritees sing the Praises of the Creator, while
        the Siddhas, seekers and silent sages meditate on Him. Nanak has
        entered the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master, the treasure of
        mercy; by great good fortune, he sings the Praises of the Lord,
        Har, Har.  || 4 || 1 || 11 || <br>

          VAAR OF SOOHEE,  WITH SHALOKS OF THE THIRD MEHL:
        </center>
      </p>
      <p> <font color="#000000">SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  In her red robes, the
        discarded bride goes out, seeking enjoyment with another's
        husband. She leaves the husband of her own home, enticed by her
        love of duality. She finds it sweet, and eats it up; her excessive
        sensuality only makes her disease worse. She forsakes the Lord,
        her sublime Husband, and then later, she suffers the pain of separation
        from Him. But she who becomes Gurmukh, turns away from corruption
        and adorns herself, attuned to the Love of the Lord. She enjoys
        her celestial Husband Lord, and enshrines the Lord's Name
        within her heart. She is humble and obedient; she is His virtuous
        bride forever; the Creator unites her with Himself. O Nanak, she
        who has obtained the True Lord as her husband, is a happy soul-bride
        forever.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O meek, red-robed bride, keep
        your Husband Lord always in your thoughts. O Nanak, your life
        shall be embellished, and your generations shall be saved along
        with you.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself established His throne,
        in the Akaashic ethers and the nether worlds. By the Hukam of
        His Command, He created the earth, the true home of Dharma. He
        Himself created and destroys; He is the True Lord, merciful to
        the meek. You give sustenance to all; how wonderful and unique
        is the Hukam of Your Command! You Yourself are permeating and
        pervading; You Yourself are the Cherisher.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,
        THIRD MEHL:  The red-robed woman becomes a happy soul-bride,
        only when she accepts the True Name. Become pleasing to your True
        Guru, and you shall be totally beautified; otherwise, there is
        no place of rest. So decorate yourself with the decorations that
        will never stain, and love the Lord day and night. O Nanak, what
        is the character of the happy soul-bride? Within her, is Truth;
        her face is bright and radiant, and she is absorbed in her Lord
        and Master.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O people: I am in red, dressed
        in a red robe. But my Husband Lord is not obtained by any robes;
        I have tried and tried, and given up wearing robes. O Nanak, they
        alone obtain their Husband Lord, who listen to the Guru's
        Teachings. Whatever pleases Him, happens. In this way, the Husband
        Lord is met.  || 2 || <br>

        </center>
      </p>
      <p> PAUREE:  By His Command, He created the creation, the world with
        its many species of beings. I do not know how great Your Command
        is, O Unseen and Infinite True Lord. You join some with Yourself;
        they reflect on the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Those who
        are imbued with the True Lord are immaculate and pure; they conquer
        egotism and corruption. He alone is united with You, whom You
        unite with Yourself; he alone is true.  || 2 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD
        MEHL:  O red-robed woman, the whole world is red, engrossed in
        evil-mindedness and the love of duality. In an instant, this falsehood
        totally vanishes; like the shade of a tree, it is gone. The Gurmukh
        is the deepest crimson of crimson, dyed in the permanent color
        of the Lord's Love. She turns away from Maya, and enters
        the celestial home of the Lord; the Ambrosial Name of the Lord
        dwells within her mind. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to my Guru;
        meeting Him, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||
        THIRD MEHL:  The red color is vain and useless; it cannot help
        you obtain your Husband Lord. This color does not take long to
        fade; she who loves duality, ends up a widow. She who loves to
        wear her red dress is foolish and double-minded. So make the True
        Word of the Shabad your red dress, and let the Fear of God, and
        the Love of God, be your ornaments and decorations. O Nanak, she
        is a happy soul-bride forever, who walks in harmony with the Will
        of the True Guru.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself created Himself,
        and He Himself evaluates Himself. His limits cannot be known;
        through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is understood.
        In the darkness of attachment to Maya, the world wanders in duality.
        The self-willed manmukhs find no place of rest; they continue
        coming and going. Whatever pleases Him, that alone happens. All
        walk according to His Will.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The
        red-robed bride is vicious; she forsakes God, and cultivates love
        for another man. She has neither modesty or self-discipline; the
        self-willed manmukh constantly tells lies, and is ruined by the
        bad karma of evil deeds. She who has such pre-ordained destiny,
        obtains the True Guru has her Husband. She discards all her red
        dresses, and wears the ornaments of mercy and forgiveness around
        her neck. In this world and the next, she receives great honor,
        and the whole world worships her. She who is enjoyed by her Creator
        Lord stands out, and does not blend in with the crowd. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukh is the happy soul-bride forever; she has the Imperishable
        Lord God as her Husband.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The red color
        is like a dream in the night; it is like a necklace without a
        string. The Gurmukhs take on the permanent color, contemplating
        the Lord God. O Nanak, with the supreme sublime essence of the
        Lord's Love, all sins and evil deeds are turned to ashes.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself created this world, and staged
        this wondrous play. Into the body of the five elements, He infused
        attachment, falsehood and self-conceit. The ignorant, self-willed
        manmukh comes and goes, wandering in reincarnation. He Himself
        teaches some to become Gurmukh, through the spiritual wisdom of
        the Lord. He blesses them with the treasure of devotional worship,
        and the wealth of the Lord's Name.  || 4 ||   SHALOK, 
        THIRD MEHL: <br>

      </p>
      <p> O red-robed woman, discard your red dress, and then, you shall
        come to love your Husband Lord. By wearing her red dress, no one
        has found her Husband Lord; the self-willed manmukh is burnt to
        death. Meeting the True Guru, she discards her red dress, and
        eradicates egotism from within. Her mind and body are imbued with
        the deep red color of His Love, and her tongue is imbued, singing
        His Praises and excellences. She becomes His soul-bride forever,
        with the Word of the Shabad in her mind; she makes the Fear of
        God and the Love of God her ornaments and decorations. O Nanak,
        by His Merciful Grace, she obtains the Mansion of the Lord's
        Presence, and keeps Him enshrined in her heart.  || 1 ||   THIRD
        MEHL:  O bride, forsake your red dress, and decorate yourself
        with the crimson color of His Love. Your comings and goings shall
        be forgotten, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
        The soul-bride is adorned and beautiful; the Celestial Lord, her
        Husband, abides in her home. O Nanak, the bride ravishes and enjoys
        Him; and He, the Ravisher, ravishes and enjoys her.  || 2 || 
        PAUREE:  The foolish, self-willed manmukh is engrossed in false
        attachment to family. Practicing egotism and self-conceit, he
        dies and departs, taking nothing along with him. He does not understand
        that the Messenger of Death is hovering over his head; he is deluded
        by duality. This opportunity will not come into his hands again;
        the Messenger of Death will seize him. He acts according to his
        pre-ordained destiny.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Do not
        call them 'satee', who burn themselves along with
        their husbands' corpses. O Nanak, they alone are known
        as 'satee', who die from the shock of separation.
        || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  They are also known as 'satee',
        who abide in modesty and contentment. They serve their Lord, and
        rise in the early hours to contemplate Him.  || 2 ||   THIRD MEHL:
        The widows burn themselves in the fire, along with their husbands'
        corpses. If they truly knew their husbands, then they suffer terrible
        bodily pain. O Nanak, if they did not truly know their husbands,
        why should they burn themselves in the fire? Whether their husbands
        are alive or dead, those wives remain far away from them.  ||
        3 ||   PAUREE:  You created pain along with pleasure; O Creator,
        such is the writ You have written. There is no other gift as great
        as the Name; it has no form or sign. The Naam, the Name of the
        Lord, is an inexhaustible treasure; it abides in the mind of the
        Gurmukh. In His Mercy, He blesses us with the Naam, and then,
        the writ of pain and pleasure is not written. Those humble servants
        who serve with love, meet the Lord, chanting the Chant of the
        Lord.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  They know that they will
        have to depart, so why do they make such ostentatious displays?
        Those who do not know that they will have to depart, continue
        to arrange their affairs.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  He accumulates
        wealth during the night of his life, but in the morning, he must
        depart. O Nanak, it shall not go along with him, and so he regrets.
        || 2 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Paying a fine under pressure, does not
        bring either merit or goodness. That alone is a good deed, O Nanak,
        which is done by one's own free will.  || 3 ||   SECOND
        MEHL:  Stubborn-mindedness will not win the Lord to one's
        side, no matter how much it is tried. The Lord is won over to
        your side, by offering Him your true love, O servant Nanak, and
        contemplating the Word of the Shabad.  || 4 ||   PAUREE:  The
        Creator created the world; He alone understands it. He Himself
        created the Universe, and He  Himself shall destroy it afterwards. <br>

      <p> All have grown weary of wandering throughout the four ages, but
        none know the Lord's worth. The True Guru has shown me
        the One Lord, and my mind and body are at peace. The Gurmukh praises
        the Lord forever; that alone happens, which the Creator Lord does.
        || 7 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  Those who have the Fear of God,
        have no other fears; those who do not have the Fear of God, are
        very afraid. O Nanak, this mystery is revealed at the Court of
        the Lord.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  That which flows, mingles with
        that which flows; that which blows, mingles with that which blows.
        The living mingle with the living, and the dead mingle with the
        dead. O Nanak, praise the One who created the creation.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  Those who meditate on the True Lord are true; they
        contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. They subdue
        their ego, purify their minds, and enshrine the Lord's
        Name within their hearts. The fools are attached to their homes,
        mansions and balconies. The self-willed manmukhs are caught in
        darkness; they do not know the One who created them. He alone
        understands, whom the True Lord causes to understand; what can
        the helpless creatures do?  || 8 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O
        bride, decorate yourself, after you surrender and accept your
        Husband Lord. Otherwise, your Husband Lord will not come to your
        bed, and your ornaments will be useless. O bride, your decorations
        will adorn you, only when your Husband Lord's Mind is pleased.
        Your ornaments will be acceptable and approved, only when your
        Husband Lord loves you. So make the Fear of God your ornaments,
        joy your betel nuts to chew, and love your food. Surrender your
        body and mind to your Husband Lord, and then, O Nanak, He will
        enjoy you.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The wife takes flowers, and
        fragrance of betel, and decorates herself. But her Husband Lord
        does not come to her bed, and so these efforts are useless.  ||
        2 ||   THIRD MEHL:  They are not said to be husband and wife,
        who merely sit together. They alone are called husband and wife,
        who have one light in two bodies.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  Without
        the Fear of God, there is no devotional worship, and no love for
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Meeting with the True Guru, the
        Fear of God wells up, and one is embellished with the Fear and
        the Love of God. When the body and mind are imbued with the Lord's
        Love, egotism and desire are conquered and subdued. The mind and
        body become immaculately pure and very beautiful, when one meets
        the Lord, the Destroyer of ego. Fear and love all belong to Him;
        He is the True Lord, permeating and pervading the Universe.  ||
        9 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Waaho! Waaho! You are wonderful and
        great, O Lord and Master; You created the creation, and made us.
        You made the waters, waves, oceans, pools, plants, clouds and
        mountains. You Yourself stand in the midst of what You Yourself
        created. The selfless service of the Gurmukhs is approved; in
        celestial peace, they live the essence of reality. They receive
        the wages of their labor, begging at the Door of their Lord and
        Master. O Nanak, the Court of the Lord is overflowing and carefree;
        O my True Carefree Lord, no one returns empty-handed from Your
        Court.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The teeth are like brilliant, beautiful
        pearls, and the eyes are like sparkling jewels. Old age is their
        enemy, O Nanak; when they grow old, they waste away.  || <br>

      <p> 2 ||   PAUREE:  Praise the Lord, forever and ever; dedicate your
        body and mind to Him. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
        I have found the True, Profound and Unfathomable Lord. The Lord,
        the jewel of jewels, is permeating my mind, body and heart. The
        pains of birth and death are gone, and I shall never again be
        consigned to the cycle of reincarnation. O Nanak, praise the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, the ocean of excellence.  || 10 ||   SHALOK,
        FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak, burn this body; this burnt body has forgotten
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The dirt is piling up, and in
        the world hereafter, your hand shall not be able to reach down
        into this stagnant pond to clean it out.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:
        O Nanak, wicked are the uncountable actions of the mind. They
        bring terrible and painful retributions, but if the Lord forgives
        me, then I will be spared this punishment.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        True is the Command He sends forth, and True are the Orders He
        issues. Forever unmoving and unchanging, permeating and pervading
        everywhere, He is the All-knowing Primal Lord. By Guru's
        Grace, serve Him, through the True Insignia of the Shabad. That
        which He makes is perfect; through the Guru's Teachings,
        enjoy His Love. He is inaccessible, unfathomable and unseen; as
        Gurmukh, know the Lord.  || 11 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  O Nanak,
        the bags of coins are brought in and placed in the Court of our
        Lord and Master, and there, the genuine and the counterfeit are
        separated.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  They go and bathe at sacred
        shrines of pilgrimage, but their minds are still evil, and their
        bodies are thieves. Some of their filth is washed off by these
        baths, but they only accumulate twice as much. Like a gourd, they
        may be washed off on the outside, but on the inside, they are
        still filled with poison. The holy man is blessed, even without
        such bathing, while a thief is a thief, no matter how much he
        bathes.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself issues His Commands, and
        links the people of the world to their tasks. He Himself joins
        some to Himself, and through the Guru, they find peace. The mind
        runs around in the ten directions; the Guru holds it still. Everyone
        longs for the Name, but it is only found through the Guru's
        Teachings. Your pre-ordained destiny, written by the Lord in the
        very beginning, cannot be erased.  || 12 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:
        The two lamps light the fourteen markets. There are just as many
        traders as there are living beings. The shops are open, and trading
        is going on; whoever comes there, is bound to depart. The Righteous
        Judge of Dharma is the broker, who gives his sign of approval.
        O Nanak, those who earn the profit of the Naam are accepted and
        approved. And when they return home, they are greeted with cheers;
        they obtain the glorious greatness of the True Name.  || 1 ||
        FIRST MEHL:  Even when the night is dark, whatever is white
        retains its white color. And even when the light of day is dazzlingly
        bright, whatever is black retains its black color. The blind fools
        have no wisdom at all; their understanding is blind. O Nanak,
        without the Lord's Grace, they will never receive honor.
        || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The True Lord Himself created the body-fortress.
        Some are ruined through the love of duality, engrossed in egotism.
        This human body is so difficult to obtain; the self-willed manmukhs
        suffer in pain. He alone understands, whom the Lord Himself causes
        to understand; he is blessed by the True Guru. <br>

      </p>
      <p> He created the entire world for His play; He is pervading amongst
        all.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Thieves, adulterers, prostitutes
        and pimps, make friendships with the unrighteous, and eat with
        the unrighteous. They do not know the value of the Lord's
        Praises, and Satan is always with them. If a donkey is anointed
        with sandalwood paste, he still loves to roll in the dirt. O Nanak,
        by spinning falsehood, a fabric of falsehood is woven. False is
        the cloth and its measurement, and false is pride in such a garment.
        || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The callers to prayer, the flute-players,
        the horn-blowers, and also the singers - some are givers,
        and some are beggars; they become acceptable only through Your
        Name, Lord. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who hear and accept
        the Name.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Attachment to Maya is totally false,
        and false are those who go that way. Through egotism, the world
        is caught in conflict and strife, and it dies. The Gurmukh is
        free of conflict and strife, and sees the One Lord, pervading
        everywhere. Recognizing that the Supreme Soul is everywhere, he
        crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. His light merges into
        the Light, and he is absorbed into the Lord's Name.  ||
        14 ||   SHALOK:  FIRST MEHL:  O True Guru, bless me with Your
        charity; You are the All-powerful Giver. May I subdue and quiet
        my egotism, pride, sexual desire, anger and self-conceit. Burn
        away all my greed, and give me the Support of the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. Day and night, keep me ever-fresh and new, spotless
        and pure; let me never be soiled by sin. O Nanak, in this way
        I am saved; by Your Grace, I have found peace.  || 1 ||   FIRST
        MEHL:  There is only the one Husband Lord, for all who stand at
        His Door. O Nanak, they ask for news of their Husband Lord, from
        those who are imbued with His Love.  || 2 ||   FIRST MEHL:  All
        are imbued with love for their Husband Lord; I am a discarded
        bride - what good am I? My body is filled with so many
        faults; my Lord and Master does not even turn His thoughts to
        me.  || 3 ||   FIRST MEHL:  I am a sacrifice to those who praise
        the Lord with their mouths. All the nights are for the happy soul-brides;
        I am a discarded bride - if only I could have even one
        night with Him!  || 4 ||   PAUREE:  I am a beggar at Your Door,
        begging for charity; O Lord, please grant me Your Mercy, and give
        to me. As Gurmukh, unite me, your humble servant, with You, that
        I may receive Your Name. Then, the unstruck melody of the Shabad
        will vibrate and resound, and my light will blend with the Light.
        Within my heart, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and
        celebrate the Word of the Lord's Shabad. The Lord Himself
        is pervading and permeating the world; so fall in love with Him!
        || 15 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  Those who do not obtain the
        sublime essence, the love and delight of their Husband Lord, are
        like guests in a deserted house; they leave just as they have
        come, empty-handed.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  He receives hundreds
        and thousands of reprimands, day and night; the swan-soul has
        renounced the Lord's Praises, and attached itself to a
        rotting carcass. Cursed is that life, in which one only eats to
        fill his belly. O Nanak, without the True Name, all one's
        friends turn to enemies.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The minstrel continually
        sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, to embellish his life.
        The Gurmukh serves and praises the True Lord, enshrining Him within
        his heart. <br>

      </p>
      <p> He obtains his own home and mansion, by loving the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord. As Gurmukh, I have obtained the Naam; I am a sacrifice
        to the Guru. You Yourself embellish and adorn us, O Creator Lord.
        || 16 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  When the lamp is lit, the darkness
        is dispelled; reading the Vedas, sinful intellect is destroyed.
        When the sun rises, the moon is not visible. Wherever spiritual
        wisdom appears, ignorance is dispelled. Reading the Vedas is the
        world's occupation; the Pandits read them, study them and
        contemplate them. Without understanding, all are ruined. O Nanak,
        the Gurmukh is carried across.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Those who
        do not savor the Word of the Shabad, do not love the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord. They speak insipidly with their tongues, and
        are continually disgraced. O Nanak, they act according to the
        karma of their past actions, which no one can erase.  || 2 ||
        PAUREE:  One who praises his God, receives honor. He drives
        out egotism from within himself, and enshrines the True Name within
        his mind. Through the True Word of the Guru's Bani, he
        chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and finds true peace.
        He is united with the Lord, after being separated for so long;
        the Guru, the Primal Being, unites him with the Lord. In this
        way, his filthy mind is cleansed and purified, and he meditates
        on the Name of the Lord.  || 17 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  With
        the fresh leaves of the body, and the flowers of virtue, Nanak
        has weaved his garland. The Lord is pleased with such garlands,
        so why pick any other flowers?  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  O Nanak,
        it is the spring season for those, within whose homes their Husband
        Lord abides. But those, whose Husband Lord is far away in distant
        lands, continue burning, day and night.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The
        Merciful Lord Himself forgives those who dwell upon the Word of
        the Guru, the True Guru. Night and day, I serve the True Lord,
        and chant His Glorious Praises; my mind merges into Him. My God
        is infinite; no one knows His limit. Grasping hold of the feet
        of the True Guru, meditate continually on the Lord's Name.
        Thus you shall obtain the fruits of your desires, and all wishes
        shall be fulfilled within your home.  || 18 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST
        MEHL:  Spring brings forth the first blossoms, but the Lord blossoms
        earlier still. By His blossoming, everything blossoms; no one
        else causes Him to blossom forth.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  He
        blossoms forth even earlier than the spring; reflect upon Him.
        O Nanak, praise the One who gives Support to all.  || 2 ||   SECOND
        MEHL:  By uniting, the united one is not united; he unites, only
        if he is united. But if he unites deep within his soul, then he
        is said to be united.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  Praise the Name of the
        Lord, Har, Har, and practice truthful deeds. Attached to other
        deeds, one is consigned to wander in reincarnation. Attuned to
        the Name, one obtains the Name, and through the Name, sings the
        Lord's Praises. Praising the Word of the Guru's
        Shabad, he merges in the Lord's Name. Service to the True
        Guru is fruitful and rewarding; serving Him, the fruits are obtained.
        || 19 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND MEHL:  Some people have others, but
        I am forlorn and dishonored; I have only You, Lord. <br>

      <p> I might as well just die crying, if You will not come into my
        mind.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  When there is peace and pleasure,
        that is the time to remember your Husband Lord. In times of suffering
        and pain, remember Him then as well. Says Nanak, O wise bride,
        this is the way to meet your Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        I am a worm - how can I praise You, O Lord; Your glorious
        greatness is so great! You are inaccessible, merciful and unapproachable;
        You Yourself unite us with Yourself. I have no other friend except
        You; in the end, You alone will be my Companion and Support. You
        save those who enter Your Sanctuary.. O Nanak, He is care-free;
        He has no greed at all.  || 20 || <br>

        have to endure the agony all alone.  || 2 ||   When you are seized

        Lord?  || 3 ||   My arm is tired, driving away the crows. Says
        Kabeer, this is the way the story of my life ends.  || 4 || 2
        ||   SOOHEE,  KABEER JEE:  Your time of service is at its end,

        of Death has come to take you away. What have you earned, and
        what have you lost? Come immediately! You are summoned to His
        Court!  || 1 ||   Get going! Come just as you are! You have been
        summoned to His Court. The Order has come from the Court of the
        Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I pray to the Messenger of Death:
        please, I still have some outstanding debts to collect in the
        village. I will collect them tonight; I will also pay you something
        for your expenses, and I will recite my morning prayers on the
        way.  || 2 ||   Blessed, blessed is the most fortunate servant
        of the Lord, who is imbued with the Lord's Love, in the
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Here and there, the humble
        servants of the Lord are always happy. They win the priceless
        treasure of this human life.  || 3 ||   When he is awake, he is
        sleeping, and so he loses this life. The property and wealth he
        has accumulated passes on to someone else. Says Kabeer, those

        in the dust. <br>

        attachment to Maya is not exhausted.  || 1 ||   O mad man, you
        have not obtained spiritual wisdom and meditation. You have wasted
        this human life, and lost.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O mortal, serve
        the Lord, as long as the breath of life remains in the body. And
        even when your body dies, your love for the Lord shall not die;
        you shall dwell at the Feet of the Lord.  || 2 ||   When the Word
        of the Shabad abides deep within, thirst and desire are quenched.
        When one understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command, he
        plays the game of chess with the Lord; throwing the dice, he conquers
        his own mind.  || 3 ||   Those humble beings, who know the Imperishable
        Lord and meditate on Him, are not destroyed at all. Says Kabeer,
        those humble beings who know how to throw these dice, never lose
        the game of life.  || 4 || 4 ||   SOOHEE,  LALIT,  KABEER JEE:
        In the one fortress of the body, there are five rulers, and all
        five demand payment of taxes. I have not farmed anyone's
        land, so such payment is difficult for me to pay.  || 1 ||   O
        people of the Lord, the tax-collector is constantly torturing
        me! Raising my arms up, I complained to my Guru, and He has saved
        me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The nine tax-assessors and the ten magistrates
        go out; they do not allow their subjects to live in peace. They
        do not measure with a full tape, and they take huge amounts in
        bribes.  || 2 ||   The One Lord is contained in the seventy-two
        chambers of the body, and He has written off my account. The records
        of the Righteous Judge of Dharma have been searched, and I owe
        absolutely nothing.  || 3 ||   Let no one slander the Saints,
        because the Saints and the Lord are as one. Says Kabeer, I have
        found that Guru, whose Name is Clear Understanding.  || 4 || 5

      <p> <font color="#000000">The happy soul-bride knows the worth of her
        Husband Lord. Renouncing pride, she enjoys peace and pleasure.
        She surrenders her body and mind to Him, and does not remain separate
        from Him. She does not see or hear, or speak to another.  || 1
        ||   How can anyone know the pain of another, if there is no compassion
        and sympathy within?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The discarded bride
        is miserable, and loses both worlds; she does not worship her
        Husband Lord. The bridge over the fire of hell is difficult and
        treacherous. No one will accompany you there; you will have to
        go all alone.  || 2 ||   Suffering in pain, I have come to Your
        Door, O Compassionate Lord. I am so thirsty for You, but You do
        not answer me. Says Ravi Daas, I seek Your Sanctuary, God; as
        You know me, so will You save me.  || 3 || 1 ||   SOOHEE:  That
        day which comes, that day shall go. You must march on; nothing
        remains stable. Our companions are leaving, and we must leave
        as well. We must go far away. <br>

      <p> Death is hovering over our heads.  || 1 ||   Why are you asleep?
        Wake up, you ignorant fool! You believe that your life in the
        world is true.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The One who gave you life
        shall also provide you with nourishment. In each and every heart,
        He runs His shop. Meditate on the Lord, and renounce your egotism
        and self-conceit. Within your heart, contemplate the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, sometime.  || 2 ||   Your life has passed away,
        but you have not arranged your path. Evening has set in, and soon
        there will be darkness on all sides. Says Ravi Daas, O ignorant
        mad-man, don't you realize, that this world is the house
        of death?!  || 3 || 2 ||   SOOHEE:  You may have lofty mansions,
        halls and kitchens. But you cannot stay in them, even for an instant,
        after death.  || 1 ||   This body is like a house of straw. When
        it is burnt, it mixes with dust.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Even relatives,
        family and friends begin to say, &quot;Take his body out, immediately!&quot;
        || 2 ||   And the wife of his house, who was so attached to his
        body and heart, runs away, crying out, &quot;Ghost! Ghost!&quot;
        || 3 ||   Says Ravi Daas, the whole world has been plundered,
        but I have escaped, chanting the Name of the One Lord.  || 4 ||

      <p> <font color="#000000">Burning and burning, writhing in pain, I wring
        my hands. I have gone insane, seeking my Husband Lord. O my Husband
        Lord, You are angry with me in Your Mind. The fault is with me,
        and not with my Husband Lord.  || 1 ||   O my Lord and Master,
        I do not know Your excellence and worth. Having wasted my youth,
        now I come to regret and repent.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O black
        bird, what qualities have made you black? &quot;I have been
        burnt by separation from my Beloved.&quot; Without her Husband
        Lord, how can the soul-bride ever find peace? When He becomes
        merciful, then God unites us with Himself.  || 2 ||   The lonely
        soul-bride suffers in the pit of the world. She has no companions,
        and no friends. In His Mercy, God has united me with the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy. And when I look again, then I
        find God as my Helper.  || 3 ||   The path upon which I must walk
        is very depressing. It is sharper than a two-edged sword, and
        very narrow. That is where my path lies. O Shaykh Fareed, think
        of that path early on.  || 4 || 1 ||   SOOHEE,  LALIT:  You were
        not able to make yourself a raft when you should have. When the
        ocean is churning and over-flowing, then it is very difficult
        to cross over it.  || 1 ||   Do not touch the safflower with your
        hands; its color will fade away, my dear.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        First, the bride herself is weak, and then, her Husband Lord's
        Order is hard to bear. Milk does not return to the breast; it
        will not be collected again.  || 2 ||   Says Fareed, O my companions,
        when our Husband Lord calls, the soul departs, sad at heart, and
        this body returns to dust.  || 3 || 2 || </font><br>
