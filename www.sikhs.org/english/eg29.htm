      <p> The Lord has exposed the penitent's secret sin to the elders.
        The Righteous Judge of Dharma said to the Messenger of Death,
  &quot;Take this penitent and put him with the worst of the worst
        murderers.&quot; No one is to look at the face of this penitent
        again. He has been cursed by the True Guru. Nanak speaks and reveals
        what has taken place in the Court of the Lord. He alone understands,
        who is blessed and adorned by the Lord.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:
        The devotees of the Lord worship and adore the Lord, and the
        glorious greatness of the Lord. The Lord's devotees continually
        sing the Kirtan of His Praises; the Name of the Lord is the Giver
        of peace. The Lord ever bestows upon His devotees the glorious
        greatness of His Name, which increases day by day. The Lord inspires
        His devotees to sit, steady and stable, in the home of their inner
        being. He preserves their honor. The Lord summons the slanderers
        to answer for their accounts, and He punishes them severely. As
        the slanderers think of acting, so are the fruits they obtain.
        Actions done in secrecy are sure to come to light, even if one
        does it underground. Servant Nanak blossoms forth in joy, beholding
        the glorious greatness of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The Lord Himself is the Protector of His devotees; what
        can the sinner do to them? The proud fool acts in pride, and eating
        his own poison, he dies. His few days have come to an end, and
        he is cut down like the crop at harvest. According to one's
        actions, so is one spoken of. Glorious and great is the Lord and
        Master of servant Nanak; He is the Master of all.  || 30 ||  
        SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  The self-willed manmukhs forget the Primal
        Lord, the Source of all; they are caught in greed and egotism.
        They pass their nights and days in conflict and struggle; they
        do not contemplate the Word of the Shabad. The Creator has taken
        away all their understanding and purity; all their speech is evil
        and corrupt. No matter what they are given, they are not satisfied;
        within their hearts there is great desire, ignorance and darkness.
        O Nanak, it is good to break away from the self-willed manmukhs,
        who have love and attachment to Maya.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:
        Those whose hearts are filled with the love of duality, do not
        love the Gurmukhs. They come and go, and wander in reincarnation;
        even in their dreams, they find no peace. They practice falsehood
        and they speak falsehood; attached to falsehood, they become false.
        The love of Maya is total pain; in pain they perish, and in pain
        they cry out. O Nanak, there can be no union between the love
        of worldliness and the love of the Lord, no matter how much everyone
        may desire it. Those who have the treasure of virtuous deeds find
        peace through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.  || 2 ||   PAUREE,
        FIFTH MEHL:  O Nanak, the Saints and the silent sages think,
        and the four Vedas proclaim, that whatever the Lord's devotees
        speak comes to pass. He is revealed in His cosmic workshop; all
        people hear of it. The foolish people, who fight with the Saints,
        find no peace. The Saints seek to bless them with virtue, but
        they are burning with egotism. </p>

      </p>
      <p> What can those wretched ones do? Their evil destiny was pre-ordained.
        Those who are struck down by the Supreme Lord God do not belong
        to anyone. Those who hate the One who has no hatred, are destroyed
        by righteous justice. Those who are cursed by the Saints wander
        around lost. When the tree is cut off at its roots, the branches
        wither and die.  || 31 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Guru Nanak implanted
        the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me; He is All-powerful,
        to create and destroy. Remember God forever, my friend, and all
        your suffering will disappear.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The hungry
        person does not care about honor, dishonor or harsh words. Nanak
        begs for the Name of the Lord; please grant Your Grace, and unite
        me with Yourself.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  According to the deeds which
        one does, so are the fruits one obtains. If someone chews on red-hot
        iron, his throat will be burned. The halter is put around his
        neck and he is led away, because of the evil deeds he has done.
        None of his desires are fulfilled; he continually steals the filth
        of others. The ungrateful wretch does not appreciate what he has
        been given; he wanders lost in reincarnation. He loses all support,
        when the Support of the Lord is taken away from him. He does not
        let the embers of strife die down, and so the Creator destroys
        him. Those who indulge in egotism crumble and fall to the ground.
        || 32 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  The Gurmukh is blessed with
        spiritual wisdom and a discerning intellect. He sings the Glorious
        Praises of the Lord, and weaves this garland into his heart. He
        becomes the purest of the pure, a being of supreme understanding.
        Whoever he meets, he saves and carries across. The fragrance of
        the Lord's Name permeates his being deep within. He is honored
        in the Court of the Lord, and his speech is the most sublime.
        Those who hear him are delighted. O Nanak, meeting the True Guru,
        one obtains the wealth and property of the Naam.  || 1 ||   FOURTH
        MEHL:  The sublime state of the True Guru is not known; no one
        knows what pleases the Perfect True Guru. Deep within the hearts
        of His GurSikhs, the True Guru is pervading. The Guru is pleased
        with those who long for His Sikhs. As the True Guru directs them,
        they do their work and chant their prayers. The True Lord accepts
        the service of His GurSikhs. But those who want the GurSikhs to
        work for them, without the Order of the True Guru  -  the Guru's
        Sikhs shall not come near them again. One who works diligently
        for the Guru, the True Guru  -  the GurSikhs work for him.
        One who comes to deceive, who rises up and goes out to deceive
        -  the GurSikhs shall never come near him. Nanak proclaims
        and announces this wisdom of God. One who is not pleasing to the
        Mind of the True Guru may do his deeds, but that being will only
        suffer in terrible pain.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  O True Lord and Master,
        You are so very great. As great as You are, You are the greatest
        of the great. He alone is united with You, whom You unite with
        Yourself. You Yourself bless and forgive us, and tear up our accounts.
        One whom You unite with Yourself, whole-heartedly serves the True
        Guru. You are the True One, the True Lord and Master; my soul,
        body, flesh and bones are all Yours. </p>

      <p> If it pleases You, then save me, True Lord. Nanak places the hopes
        of his mind in You alone, O greatest of the great!  || 33 || 1
        ||  SUDH  || </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <center>
        GAUREE KEE VAAR, FIFTH MEHL: SUNG TO THE TUNE OF VAAR OF RAA-I
        KAMAALDEE-MOJADEE:
        <p> ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.  BY THE GRACE OF THE TRUE GURU:</p>
      </center>
      <p> SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Auspicious and approved is the birth of
        that humble being who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. I
        am a sacrifice to that humble being who vibrates and meditates
        on God, the Lord of Nirvaanaa. The pains of birth and death are
        eradicated, upon meeting the All-knowing Lord, the Primal Being.
        In the Society of the Saints, he crosses over the world-ocean;
        O servant Nanak, he has the strength and support of the True Lord.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  I rise up in the early morning hours,
        and the Holy Guest comes into my home. I wash His feet; He is
        always pleasing to my mind and body. I hear the Naam, and I gather
        in the Naam; I am lovingly attuned to the Naam. My home and wealth
        are totally sanctified as I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        The Trader in the Lord's Name, O Nanak, is found by great
        good fortune.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Whatever pleases You is good;
        True is the Pleasure of Your Will. You are the One, pervading
        in all; You are contained in all. You are diffused throughout
        and permeating all places and interspaces; You are known to be
        deep within the hearts of all beings. Joining the Saadh Sangat,
        the Company of the Holy, and submitting to His Will, the True
        Lord is found. Nanak takes to the Sanctuary of God; he is forever
        and ever a sacrifice to Him.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL: 
        If you are conscious, then be conscious of the True Lord, Your
        Lord and Master. O Nanak, come aboard upon the boat of the service
        of the True Guru, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. 
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  He wears his body, like clothes of wind
        -  what a proud fool he is! O Nanak, they will not go with
        him in the end; they shall be burnt to ashes.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        They alone are delivered from the world, who are preserved and
        protected by the True Lord. I live by beholding the faces of those
        who taste the Ambrosial Essence of the Lord. Sexual desire, anger,
        greed and emotional attachment are burnt away, in the Company
        of the Holy. God grants His Grace, and the Lord Himself tests
        them. O Nanak, His play is not known; no one can understand it.
        || 2 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  O Nanak, that day is beautiful,
        when God comes to mind. Cursed is that day, no matter how pleasant
        the season, when the Supreme Lord God is forgotten.  || 1 || 
        FIFTH MEHL:  O Nanak, become friends with the One, who holds
        everything in His hands. They are accounted as false friends,
        who do not go with you, for even one step.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is Ambrosial
        Nectar; meet together and drink it in, O Siblings of Destiny.
        Remembering Him in meditation, peace is found, and all thirst
        is quenched. So serve the Supreme Lord God and the Guru, and you
        shall never be hungry again. All your desires shall be fulfilled,
        and you shall obtain the status of immortality. You alone are
        as great as Yourself, O Supreme Lord God; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary.
        || 3 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have seen all places; there
        is no place without Him. </p>

      </p>
      <p> O Nanak, those who meet with the True Guru find the object of
        life.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Like the flash of lightning, worldly
        affairs last only for a moment. The only thing which is pleasing,
        O Nanak, is that which inspires one to meditate on the Name of
        the Master.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  People have searched all the Simritees
        and Shaastras, but no one knows the Lord's value. That being,
        who joins the Saadh Sangat enjoys the Love of the Lord. True is
        the Naam, the Name of the Creator, the Primal Being. It is the
        mine of precious jewels. That mortal, who has such pre-ordained
        destiny inscribed upon his forehead, meditates in remembrance
        on the Lord. O Lord, please bless Nanak, Your humble guest, with
        the supplies of the True Name.  || 4 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:
        He harbors anxiety within himself, but to the eyes, he appears
        to be happy; his hunger never departs. O Nanak, without the True
        Name, no one's sorrows have ever departed.  || 1 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  Those caravans which did not load the Truth have been plundered.
        O Nanak, those who meet the True Guru, and acknowledge the One
        Lord, are congratulated.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Beautiful is that
        place, where the Holy people dwell. They serve their All-powerful
        Lord, and they give up all their evil ways. The Saints and the
        Vedas proclaim, that the Supreme Lord God is the Saving Grace
        of sinners. You are the Lover of Your devotees  -  this is
        Your natural way, in each and every age. Nanak asks for the One
        Name, which is pleasing to his mind and body.  || 5 ||   SHALOK,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The sparrows are chirping, and dawn has come; the
        wind stirs up the waves. Such a wondrous thing the Saints have
        fashioned, O Nanak, in the Love of the Naam.  || 1 ||   FIFTH
        MEHL:  Homes, palaces and pleasures are there, where You, O Lord,
        come to mind. All worldly grandeur, O Nanak, is like false and
        evil friends.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The wealth of the Lord is the
        true capital; how rare are those who understand this. He alone
        receives it, O Siblings of Destiny, unto whom the Architect of
        Destiny gives it. His servant is imbued with the Love of the Lord;
        his body and mind blossom forth. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and all
        of his sufferings are removed. O Nanak, he alone lives, who acknowledges
        the One Lord.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  The fruit of the
        swallow-wort plant looks beautiful, attached to the branch of
        the tree; but when it is separated from the stem of its Master,
        O Nanak, it breaks apart into thousands of fragments.  || 1 ||
        FIFTH MEHL: Those who forget the Lord die, but they cannot die
        a complete death. Those who turn their backs on the Lord suffer,
        like the thief impaled on the gallows.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The
        One God is the treasure of peace; I have heard that He is eternal
        and imperishable. He is totally pervading the water, the land
        and the sky; the Lord is said to be permeating each and every
        heart. He looks alike upon the high and the low, the ant and the
        elephant. Friends, companions, children and relatives are all
        created by Him. O Nanak, one who is blessed with the Naam, enjoys
        the Lord's love and affection.  || 7 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  Those who do not forget the Lord, with each breath and
        morsel of food, whose minds are filled with the Mantra of the
        Lord's Name  -  they alone are blessed; O Nanak, they
        are the perfect Saints.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Twenty-four hours
        a day, he wanders around, driven by his hunger for food. </p>

      <p> How can he escape from falling into hell, when he does not remember
        the Prophet?  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Serve Him, O mortals, who has
        the Lord's Name in His lap. You shall dwell in peace and
        ease in this world; in the world hereafter, it shall go with you.
        So build your home of true righteousness, with the unshakable
        pillars of Dharma. Take the Support of the Lord, who gives support
        in the spiritual and material worlds. Nanak grasps the Lotus Feet
        of the Lord; he humbly bows in His Court.  || 8 ||   SHALOK, 
        FIFTH MEHL:  The beggar begs for charity: give to me, O my Beloved!
        O Great Giver, O Giving Lord, my consciousness is continually
        centered on You. The immeasurable warehouses of the Lord can never
        be emptied out. O Nanak, the Word of the Shabad is infinite; it
        has arranged everything perfectly.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  O Sikhs,
        love the Word of the Shabad; in life and death, it is our only
        support. Your face shall be radiant, and you shall find a lasting
        peace, O Nanak, remembering the One Lord in meditation.  || 2
        ||   PAUREE:  There, the Ambrosial Nectar is distributed; the
        Lord is the Bringer of peace. They are not placed upon the path
        of Death, and they shall not have to die again. One who comes
        to savor the Lord's Love experiences it. The Holy beings
        chant the Bani of the Word, like nectar flowing from a spring.
        Nanak lives by beholding the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of
        those who have implanted the Lord's Name within their minds.
        || 9 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Serving the Perfect True Guru,
        suffering ends. O Nanak, worshipping the Naam in adoration, one's
        affairs come to be resolved.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Remembering
        Him in meditation, misfortune departs, and one comes to abide
        in peace and bliss. O Nanak, meditate forever on the Lord  - 
        do not forget Him, even for an instant.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  How
        can I estimate the glory of those, who have found the Lord, Har,
        Har? One who seeks the Sanctuary of the Holy is released from
        bondage. One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Imperishable
        Lord does not burn in the womb of reincarnation. One who meets
        the Guru and the Supreme Lord God, who reads and understands,
        enters the state of Samaadhi. Nanak has obtained that Lord Master,
        who is inaccessible and unfathomable.  || 10 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  People do not perform their duties, but instead, they wander
        around aimlessly. O Nanak, if they forget the Name, how can they
        ever find peace?  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The bitter poison of
        corruption is everywhere; it clings to the substance of the world.
        O Nanak, the humble being has realized that the Name of the Lord
        alone is sweet.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  This is the distinguishing
        sign of the Holy Saint, that by meeting with him, one is saved.
        The Messenger of Death does not come near him; he never has to
        die again. He crosses over the terrifying, poisonous world-ocean.
        So weave the garland of the Lord's Glorious Praises into
        your mind, and all your filth shall be washed away. Nanak remains
        blended with his Beloved, the Supreme Lord God.  || 11 ||   SHALOK,
        FIFTH MEHL:  O Nanak, approved is the birth of those, within
        whose consciousness the Lord abides. Useless talk and babbling
        is useless, my friend.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  I have come to
        see the Supreme Lord God, the Perfect, Inaccessible, Wonderful
        Lord. </p>

      <p> Nanak has made the Lord's Name his wealth, by the Grace of
        the Perfect Guru.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Deception does not work
        with our Lord and Master; through their greed and emotional attachment,
        people are ruined. They do their evil deeds, and sleep in the
        intoxication of Maya. Time and time again, they are consigned
        to reincarnation, and abandoned on the path of Death. They receive
        the consequences of their own actions, and are yoked to their
        pain. O Nanak, if one forgets the Name, all the seasons are evil.
        || 12 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  While standing up, sitting down
        and sleeping, be at peace; O Nanak, praising the Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, the mind and body are cooled and soothed.  || 1 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  Filled with greed, he constantly wanders around;
        he does not do any good deeds. O Nanak, the Lord abides within
        the mind of one who meets with the Guru.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  All
        material things are bitter; the True Name alone is sweet. Those
        humble servants of the Lord who taste it, come to savor its flavor.
        It comes to dwell within the mind of those who are so pre-destined
        by the Supreme Lord God. The One Immaculate Lord is pervading
        everywhere; He destroys the love of duality. Nanak begs for the
        Lord's Name, with his palms pressed together; by His Pleasure,
        God has granted it.  || 13 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  The most
        excellent begging is begging for the One Lord. Other talk is corrupt,
        O Nanak, except that of the Lord Master.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:
        One who recognizes the Lord is very rare; his mind is pierced
        through with the Love of the Lord. Such a Saint is the Uniter,
        O Nanak  -  he straightens out the path.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:
        Serve Him, O my soul, who is the Giver and the Forgiver. All
        sinful mistakes are erased, by meditating in remembrance on the
        Lord of the Universe. The Holy Saint has shown me the Way to the
        Lord; I chant the GurMantra. The taste of Maya is totally bland
        and insipid; the Lord alone is pleasing to my mind. Meditate,
        O Nanak, on the Transcendent Lord, who has blessed you with your
        soul and your life.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  The time
        has come to plant the seed of the Lord's Name; one who plants
        it, shall eat its fruit. He alone receives it, O Nanak, whose
        destiny is so pre-ordained.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  If one begs,
        then he should beg for the Name of the True One, which is given
        only by His Pleasure. Eating this gift from the Lord and Master,
        O Nanak, the mind is satisfied.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  They alone
        earn profit in this world, who have the wealth of the Lord's
        Name. They do not know the love of duality; they place their hopes
        in the True Lord. They serve the One Eternal Lord, and give up
        everything else. One who forgets the Supreme Lord God  -  useless
        is his breath. God draws His humble servant close in His loving
        embrace and protects him  -  Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. 
        || 15 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Supreme Lord God gave the
        Order, and the rain automatically began to fall. Grain and wealth
        were produced in abundance; the earth was totally satisfied and
        satiated. Forever and ever, chant the Glorious Praises of the
        Lord, and pain and poverty shall run away. People obtain that
        which they are pre-ordained to receive, according to the Will
        of the Lord. The Transcendent Lord keeps you alive; O Nanak, meditate
        on Him.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL: </p>

      <p> To obtain the state of life of Nirvaanaa, meditate in remembrance
        on the One Lord. There is no other place; how else can we be comforted?
        I have seen the whole world  -  without the Lord's Name,
        there is no peace at all. Body and wealth shall return to dust
        -  hardly anyone realizes this. Pleasure, beauty and delicious
        tastes are useless; what are you doing, O mortal? One whom the
        Lord Himself misleads, does not understand His awesome power.
        Those who are imbued with the Love of the Lord attain Nirvaanaa,
        singing the Praises of the True One. Nanak: those who are pleasing
        to Your Will, O Lord, seek Sanctuary at Your Door.  || 2 ||  
        PAUREE:  Those who are attached to the hem of the Lord's
        robe, do not suffer birth and death. Those who remain awake to
        the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises  -  their lives are approved.
        Those who attain the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, are
        very fortunate. But those who forget the Name  -  their lives
        are cursed, and broken like thin strands of thread. O Nanak, the
        dust of the feet of the Holy is more sacred than hundreds of thousands,
        even millions of cleansing baths at sacred shrines.  || 16 ||
        SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Like the beautiful earth, adorned with
        jewels of grass  -  such is the mind, within which the Love
        of the Lord abides. All one's affairs are easily resolved,
        O Nanak, when the Guru, the True Guru, is pleased.  || 1 ||  
        FIFTH MEHL:  Roaming and wandering in the ten directions, over
        water, mountains and forests  -  wherever the vulture sees
        a dead body, he flies down and lands.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  One
        who longs for all comforts and rewards should practice Truth.
        Behold the Supreme Lord God near you, and meditate on the Naam,
        the Name of the One Lord. Become the dust of all men's feet,
        and so merge with the Lord. Do not cause any being to suffer,
        and you shall go to your true home with honor. Nanak speaks of
        the Purifier of sinners, the Creator, the Primal Being.  || 17
        ||   SHALOK,  DOHAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have made the One Lord my
        Friend; He is All-powerful to do everything. My soul is a sacrifice
        to Him; the Lord is the treasure of my mind and body.  || 1 ||
        FIFTH MEHL:  Take my hand, O my Beloved; I shall never forsake
        You. Those who forsake the Lord, are the most evil people; they
        shall fall into the horrible pit of hell.  || 2 ||   PAUREE: 
        All treasures are in His Home; whatever the Lord does, comes to
        pass. The Saints live by chanting and meditating on the Lord,
        washing off the filth of their sins. With the Lotus Feet of the
        Lord dwelling within the heart, all misfortune is taken away.
        One who meets the Perfect Guru, shall not have to suffer through
        birth and death. Nanak is thirsty for the Blessed Vision of God's
        Darshan; by His Grace, He has bestowed it.  || 18 ||   SHALOK,
        DAKHANAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  If you can dispel your doubts, even for
        an instant, and love your only Beloved, then wherever you go,
        there you shall find Him.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Can they mount
        horses and handle guns, if all they know is the game of polo?
        Can they be swans, and fulfill their conscious desires, if they
        can only fly like chickens?  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Those who chant
        the Lord's Name with their tongues and hear it with their
        ears are saved, O my friend. Those hands which lovingly write
        the Praises of the Lord are pure. It is like performing all sorts
        of virtuous deeds, and bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines
        of pilgrimage. They cross over the world-ocean, and conquer the
        fortress of corruption. </p>

      <p> O Nanak, serve the Infinite Lord; grasp the hem of His robe, and
        He will save you.  || 19 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Worldly affairs
        are unprofitable, if the One Lord does not come to mind. O Nanak,
        the bodies of those who forget their Master shall burst apart.
        || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The ghost has been transformed into an
        angel by the Creator Lord. God has emancipated all the Sikhs and
        resolved their affairs. He has seized the slanderers and thrown
        them to the ground, and declared them false in His Court. Nanak's
        God is glorious and great; He Himself creates and adorns.  ||
        2 ||   PAUREE:  God is unlimited; He has no limit; He is the One
        who does everything. The Inaccessible and Unapproachable Lord
        and Master is the Support of His beings. Giving His Hand, He nurtures
        and cherishes; He is the Filler and Fulfiller. He Himself is Merciful
        and Forgiving. Chanting the True Name, one is saved. Whatever
        pleases You  -  that alone is good; slave Nanak seeks Your
        Sanctuary.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who belongs to
        God has no hunger. O Nanak, everyone who falls at his feet is
        saved.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  If the beggar begs for the Lord's
        Name every day, his Lord and Master will grant his request. O
        Nanak, the Transcendent Lord is the most generous host; He does
        not lack anything at all.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  To imbue the mind
        with the Lord of the Universe is the true food and dress. To embrace
        love for the Name of the Lord is to possess horses and elephants.
        To meditate on the Lord steadfastly is to rule over kingdoms of
        property and enjoy all sorts of pleasures. The minstrel begs at
        God's Door  -  he shall never leave that Door. Nanak has
        this yearning in his mind and body  -  he longs continually
        for God.  || 21 || 1 ||  SUDH KEECHAY  || </p>

      <p> I was on fire, but now I have found the Water of the Lord's
        Name. This Water of the Lord's Name has cooled my burning
        body.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   To subdue their minds, some go off
        into the forests; but that Water is not found without the Lord
        God.  || 1 ||   That fire has consumed angels and mortal beings,
        but the Water of the Lord's Name saves His humble servants
        from burning.  || 2 ||   In the terrifying world-ocean, there
        is an ocean of peace. I continue to drink it in, but this Water
        is never exhausted.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, meditate and vibrate
        upon the Lord, like the sparrow-hawk remembering the water. The
        Water of the Lord's Name has quenched my thirst.  || 4 ||
        1 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  O Lord, my thirst for the Water of
        Your Name will not go away. The fire of my thirst burns even more
        brightly in that Water.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are the Ocean
        of Water, and I am just a fish in that Water. In that Water, I
        remain; without that Water, I would perish.  || 1 ||   You are
        the cage, and I am Your parrot. So what can the cat of death do
        to me?  || 2 ||   You are the tree, and I am the bird. I am so
        unfortunate  -  I cannot see the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan!

        O Lord, please meet me  -  this is my very last chance!  ||
        4 || 2 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  When I realize that there is
        One, and only One Lord, why then should the people be upset? 
        || 1 ||   I am dishonored; I have lost my honor. No one should
        follow in my footsteps.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am bad, and bad
        in my mind as well. I have no partnership with anyone.  || 2 ||
        I have no shame about honor or dishonor. But you shall know,
        when your own false covering is laid bare.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer,
        honor is that which is accepted by the Lord. Give up everything
        -  meditate, vibrate upon the Lord alone.  || 4 || 3 ||  
        GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  If Yoga could be obtained by wandering around
        naked, then all the deer of the forest would be liberated.  ||
        1 ||   What does it matter whether someone goes naked, or wears
        a deer skin, if he does not remember the Lord within his soul?
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If the spiritual perfection of the Siddhas
        could be obtained by shaving the head, then why haven't sheep
        found liberation?  || 2 ||   If someone could save himself by
        celibacy, O Siblings of Destiny, why then haven't eunuchs
        obtained the state of supreme dignity?  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer,
        listen, O men, O Siblings of Destiny: without the Lord's
        Name, who has ever found salvation?  || 4 || 4 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER
        JEE:  Those who take their ritual baths in the evening and the
        morning are like the frogs in the water.  || 1 ||   When people
        do not love the Lord's Name, they must all go to the Righteous
        Judge of Dharma.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who love their bodies
        and try different looks, do not feel compassion, even in dreams.
        || 2 ||   The wise men call them four-footed creatures; the Holy
        find peace in this ocean of pain.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, why
        do you perform so many rituals? Renounce everything, and drink
        in the supreme essence of the Lord.  || 4 || 5 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER
        JEE:  What use is chanting, and what use is penance, fasting or
        devotional worship, to one whose heart is filled with the love
        of duality?  || 1 ||   O humble people, link your mind to the
        Lord. Through cleverness, the four-armed Lord is not obtained.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Set aside your greed and worldly ways. Set
        aside sexual desire, anger and egotism.  || 2 ||   Ritual practices
        bind people in egotism; meeting together, they worship stones.
        || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, He is obtained only by devotional worship.
        Through innocent love, the Lord is met.  || 4 || 6 ||   GAUREE,
        KABEER JEE:  In the dwelling of the womb, there is no ancestry
        or social status. All have originated from the Seed of God.  ||
        1 ||   Tell me, O Pandit, O religious scholar: since when have
        you been a Brahmin? Don't waste your life by continually
        claiming to be a Brahmin.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If you are indeed
        a Brahmin, born of a Brahmin mother, then why didn't you
        come by some other way?  || 2 ||   How is it that you are a Brahmin,
        and I am of a low social status? How is it that I am formed of
        blood, and you are made of milk?  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, one who
        contemplates God, is said to be a Brahmin among us. </p>

        sleep in peace. The king and the pauper both weep and cry.  ||
        1 ||   As long as the tongue does not chant the Lord's Name,
        the person continues coming and going in reincarnation, crying
        out in pain.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   It is like the shadow of a
        tree; when the breath of life passes out of the mortal being,
        tell me, what becomes of his wealth?  || 2 ||   It is like the
        music contained in the instrument; how can anyone know the secret
        of the dead?  || 3 ||   Like the swan on the lake, death hovers
        over the body. Drink in the Lord's sweet elixir, Kabeer.
        || 4 || 8 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  The creation is born of
        the Light, and the Light is in the creation. It bears two fruits:
        the false glass and the true pearl.  || 1 ||   Where is that home,
        which is said to be free of fear? There, fear is dispelled and
        one lives without fear.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   On the banks of
        sacred rivers, the mind is not appeased. People remain entangled
        in good and bad deeds.  || 2 ||   Sin and virtue are both the
        same. In the home of your own being, is the Philosopher's
        Stone; renounce your search for any other virtue.  || 3 ||   Kabeer:
        O worthless mortal, do not lose the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        Keep this mind of yours involved in this involvement.  || 4 ||
        9 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  He claims to know the Lord, who is
        beyond measure and beyond thought; by mere words, he plans to
        enter heaven.  || 1 ||   I do not know where heaven is. Everyone
        claims that he plans to go there.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By mere
        talk, the mind is not appeased. The mind is only appeased, when
        egotism is conquered.  || 2 ||   As long as the mind is filled
        with the desire for heaven, he does not dwell at the Lord's
        Feet.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, unto whom should I tell this? The
        Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is heaven.  || 4 || 10
        ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  We are born, and we grow, and having
        grown, we pass away. Before our very eyes, this world is passing
        away.  || 1 ||  How can you not die of shame, claiming, &quot;This
        world is mine&quot;? At the very last moment, nothing is yours.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Trying various methods, you cherish your
        body, but at the time of death, it is burned in the fire.  ||
        2 ||   You apply sandalwood oil to your limbs, but that body is
        burned with the firewood.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, listen, O virtuous
        people: your beauty shall vanish, as the whole world watches.
        || 4 || 11 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  Why do you cry and mourn,
        when another person dies? Do so only if you yourself are to live.
        || 1 ||   I shall not die as the rest of the world dies, for
        now I have met the life-giving Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   People
        anoint their bodies with fragrant oils, and in that pleasure,
        they forget the supreme bliss.  || 2 ||   There is one well, and
        five water-carriers. Even though the rope is broken, the fools
        continue trying to draw water.  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, through

        no well, and no water-carrier.  || 4 || 12 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER

        people are churning water.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The donkey grazes
        upon the green grass; arising each day, he laughs and brays, and

        sucking the milk of her lamb.  || 3 ||   Chanting the Lord's
        Name, my intellect is enlightened. Says Kabeer, the Guru has blessed
        me with this understanding.  || 4 || 1 || 14 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER
        JEE,  PANCH-PADAS:  I am like a fish out of water, because in
        my previous life, I did not practice penance and intense meditation.
        || 1 ||   Now tell me, Lord, what will my condition be? I left
        Benares  -   I had little common sense.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        I wasted my whole life in the city of Shiva; at the time of
        my death, I moved to Magahar.  || 2 ||   For many years, I practiced
        penance and intense meditation at Kaashi; now that my time to
        die has come, I have come to dwell at Magahar!  || 3 ||  Kaashi
        and Magahar  -  I consider them the same. With inadequate devotion,
        how can anyone swim across?  || 4 ||   Says Kabeer, the Guru and
        Ganaysha and Shiva all know that Kabeer died chanting the Lord's
        Name.  || 5 || 15 ||   GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  You may anoint your
        limbs with sandalwood oil, but in the end, that body will be burned
        with the firewood.  || 1 ||   Why should anyone take pride in
        this body or wealth? They shall end up lying on the ground; they
        shall not go along with you to the world beyond.  || 1 ||  Pause

        not chant the Lord's Name, even for an instant.  || 2 ||

        leaves in their mouths, but at the time of death, they shall be

        of the Lord. Chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, and find
        peace.  || 4 ||   In His Mercy, He implants the Naam within us;
        inhale deeply the sweet aroma and fragrance of the Lord, Har,
        Har.  || 5 ||   Says Kabeer, remember Him, you blind fool! The
        Lord is True; all worldly affairs are false.  || 6 || 16 ||  
        GAUREE,  KABEER JEE,  TI-PADAS AND CHAU-TUKAS:  I have turned
        away from death and turned to the Lord. Pain has been eliminated,
        and I dwell in peace  and comfort. My enemies have been transformed
        into friends. The faithless cynics have been transformed into
        good-hearted people.  || 1 ||   Now, I feel that everything brings
        me peace. Peace and tranquility have come, since I realized the
        Lord of the Universe.  || 1 || <br>
