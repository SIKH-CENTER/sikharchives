      <p> <font color="#000000">Setting aside all other days, it is said that
        the Lord was born on the eighth lunar day.  || 1 ||   Deluded
        and confused by doubt, the mortal practices falsehood. The Lord
        is beyond birth and death.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You prepare sweet
        treats and feed them to your stone god. God is not born, and He
        does not die, you foolish, faithless cynic!  || 2 ||   You sing
        lullabyes to your stone god - this is the source of all
        your mistakes. Let that mouth be burnt, which says that our Lord
        and Master is subject to birth.  || 3 ||   He is not born, and
        He does not die; He does not come and go in reincarnation. The
        God of Nanak is pervading and permeating everywhere.  || 4 ||
        1 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  Standing up, I am at peace; sitting
        down, I am at peace. I feel no fear, because this is what I understand.
        || 1 ||   The One Lord, my Lord and Master, is my Protector.
        He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of Hearts.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   I sleep without worry, and I awake without worry. You, O
        God, are pervading everywhere.  || 2 ||   I dwell in peace in
        my home, and I am at peace outside. Says Nanak, the Guru has implanted
        His Mantra within me.  || 3 || 2 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  I
        do not keep fasts, nor do I observe the month of Ramadaan. I serve
        only the One, who will protect me in the end.  || 1 ||   The One
        Lord, the Lord of the World, is my God Allah. He adminsters justice
        to both Hindus and Muslims.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I do not make
        pilgrimages to Mecca, nor do I worship at Hindu sacred shrines.
        I serve the One Lord, and not any other.  || 2 ||   I do not perform
        Hindu worship services, nor do I offer the Muslim prayers. I have
        taken the One Formless Lord into my heart; I humbly worship Him
        there.  || 3 ||   I am not a Hindu, nor am I a Muslim. My body
        and breath of life belong to Allah - to Raam - the
        God of both.  || 4 ||   Says Kabeer, this is what I say: meeting
        with the Guru, my Spiritual Teacher, I realize God, my Lord and
        Master.  || 5 || 3 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  I easily tied up
        the deer - the ten sensory organs. I shot five of the desires
        with the Word of the Lord's Bani.  || 1 ||   I go out hunting
        with the Saints, and we capture the deer without horses or weapons.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My mind used to run around outside hunting.
        But now, I have found the game within the home of my body-village.
        || 2 ||   I caught the deer and brought them home. Dividing them
        up, I shared them, bit by bit.  || 3 ||   God has given this gift.
        Nanak's home is filled with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 4 || 4 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  Even though he may be fed
        with hundreds of longings and yearnings, still the faithless cynic
        does not remember the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   Take in the teachings
        of the humble Saints. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, you shall obtain the supreme status.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Stones may be kept under water for a long time. <br>

      </p>
      <p> Even so, they do not absorb the water; they remain hard and dry.
        || 2 ||   The six Shaastras may be read to a fool, but it is
        like the wind blowing in the ten directions.  || 3 ||   It is
        like threshing a crop without any corn - nothing is gained.
        In the same way, no benefit comes from the faithless cynic.  ||
        4 ||   As the Lord attaches them, so are all attached. Says Nanak,
        God has formed such a form.  || 5 || 5 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:
        He created the soul, the breath of life and the body. He created
        all beings, and knows their pains.  || 1 ||   The Guru, the Lord
        of the Universe, is the Helper of the soul. Here and herafter,
        He always provides shade.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Worship and adoration
        of God is the pure way of life. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
        of the Holy, the love of duality vanishes.  || 2 ||   Friends,
        well-wishers and wealth will not support you. Blessed, blessed
        is my Lord.  || 3 ||   Nanak utters the Ambrosial Bani of the
        Lord. Except the One Lord, he does not know any other at all.
        || 4 || 6 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord is in front of
        me, and the Lord is behind me. My Beloved Lord, the Source of
        Nectar, is in the middle as well.  || 1 ||   God is my Shaastra
        and my favorable omen. In His Home and Mansion, I find peace,
        poise and bliss.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Chanting the Naam, the
        Name of the Lord, with my tongue, and hearing it with my ears,
        I live. Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, I have become
        eternal, permanent and stable.  || 2 ||   The pains of countless
        lifetimes have been erased. The Unstruck Sound-current of the
        Shabad, the Word of God, vibrates in the Court of the Lord.  ||
        3 ||   Granting His Grace, God has blended me with Himself. Nanak
        has entered the Sanctuary of God.  || 4 || 7 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  It brings millions of desires to fulfillment. On the Path
        of Death, It will go with you and help you.  || 1 ||   The Naam,
        the Name of the Lord of the Universe, is the holy water of the
        Ganges. Whoever meditates on it, is saved; drinking it in, the
        mortal does not wander in reincarnation again.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   It is my worship, meditation, austerity and cleansing bath.
        Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, I have become free of desire.
        || 2 ||   It is my domain and empire, wealth, mansion and court.
        Meditating in remembrance on the Naam brings perfect conduct.
        || 3 ||   Slave Nanak has deliberated, and has come to this conclusion:
        Without the Lord's Name, everything is false and worthless,
        like ashes.  || 4 || 8 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  The poison
        had absolutely no harmful effect. But the wicked Brahmin died
        in pain.  || 1 ||   The Supreme Lord God Himself has saved His
        humble servant. The sinner died through the Power of the Guru.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The humble servant of the Lord and Master
        meditates on Him. He Himself has destroyed the ignorant sinner.
        || 2 ||   God is the Mother, the Father and the Protector of
        His slave. The face of the slanderer, here and hereafter, is blackened.
        || 3 ||   The Transcendent Lord has heard the prayer of servant
        Nanak. The filthy sinner lost hope and died.  || 4 || 9 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent
        is Your Name. False, false, false, false is pride in the world.

      <p> The glorious vision of Your slaves, O Infinite Lord, is wonderful
        and beauteous. Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the whole
        world is just ashes.  || 1 ||   Your Creative Power is marvellous,
        and Your Lotus Feet are admirable. Your Praise is priceless, O
        True King.  || 2 ||   God is the Support of the unsupported. Meditate
        day and night on the Cherisher of the meek and humble.  || 3 ||
        God has been merciful to Nanak. May I never forget God; He is
        my heart, my soul, my breath of life.  || 4 || 10 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  As Gurmukh, obtain the true wealth. Accept the Will
        of God as True.  || 1 ||   Live, live, live forever. Rise early
        each day, and drink in the Nectar of the Lord. With your tongue,
        chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the One Name alone shall
        save you. Nanak speaks the wisdom of God.  || 2 || 11 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Serving the True Guru, all fruits and rewards are
        obtained. The filth of so many lifetimes is washed away.  || 1
        ||   Your Name, God, is the Purifier of sinners. Because of the
        karma of my past deeds, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
        Holy, I am saved. I am blessed with honor in God's Court.
        || 2 ||   Serving at God's Feet, all comforts are obtained.
        All the angels and demi-gods long for the dust of the feet of
        such beings.  || 3 ||   Nanak has obtained the treasure of the
        Naam. Chanting and meditating on the Lord, the whole world is
        saved.  || 4 || 12 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  God hugs His slave
        close in His Embrace. He throws the slanderer into the fire. 
        || 1 ||   The Lord saves His servants from the sinners. No one
        can save the sinner. The sinner is destroyed by his own actions.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord's slave is in love with
        the Dear Lord. The slanderer loves something else.  || 2 ||  
        The Supreme Lord God has revealed His Innate Nature. The evil-doer
        obtains the fruits of his own actions.  || 3 ||   God does not
        come or go; He is All-pervading and permeating. Slave Nanak seeks
        the Sanctuary of the Lord.  || 4 || 13 || <br>

        Lord, and you serve another. Why are you intoxicated with the
        pleasures of corruption?  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate on the
        Lord of the Universe. I have seen all other sorts of efforts;
        whatever you can think of, will only bring failure.  || 1 || 
        Pause  ||   The blind, ignorant, self-willed manmukhs forsake
        their Lord and Master, and dwell on His slave Maya. They slander
        those who worship their Lord; they are like beasts, without a
        Guru.  || 2 ||   Soul, life, body and wealth all belong to God,

      <p> They are proud and arrogant, evil-minded and filthy; without the
        Guru, they are reincarnated into the terrifying world-ocean. 
        || 3 ||   Through burnt offerings, charitable feasts, ritualistic
        chants, penance, all sorts of austere self-discipline and pilgrimages
        to sacred shrines and rivers, they do not find God. Self-conceit
        is only erased when one seeks the Lord's Sanctuary and
        becomes Gurmukh; O Nanak, he crosses over the world-ocean.  ||
        4 || 1 || 14 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have seen Him in the
        woods, and I have seen Him in the fields. I have seen Him in the
        household, and in renunciation. I have seen Him as a Yogi carrying
        His staff, as a Yogi with matted hair, fasting, making vows, and
        visiting sacred shrines of pilgrimage.  || 1 ||   I have seen
        Him in the Society of the Saints, and within my own mind. In the
        sky, in the nether regions of the underworld, and in everything,
        He is pervading and permeating. With love and joy, I sing His
        Glorious Praises.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I have seen Him among
        the Yogis, the Sannyaasees, the celibates, the wandering hermits
        and the wearers of patched coats. I have seen Him among the men
        of severe self-discipline, the silent sages, the actors, dramas
        and dances.  || 2 ||   I have seen Him in the four Vedas, I have
        seen Him in the six Shaastras, in the eighteen Puraanas and the
        Simritees as well. All together, they declare that there is only
        the One Lord. So tell me, from whom is He hidden?  || 3 ||   Unfathomable
        and Inaccessible, He is our Infinite Lord and Master; His Value
        is beyond valuation. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice
        to those, within whose heart He is revealed.  || 4 || 2 || 15
        ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  How can anyone do evil, if he realizes
        that the Lord is near? One who gathers corruption, constantly
        feels fear. He is near, but this mystery is not understood. Without
        the True Guru, all are enticed by Maya.  || 1 ||   Everyone says
        that He is near, near at hand. But rare is that person, who, as
        Gurmukh, understands this mystery. || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The mortal
        does not see the Lord near at hand; instead, he goes to the homes
        of others. He steals their wealth and lives in falsehood. Under
        the influence of the drug of illusion, he does not know that the
        Lord is with him. Without the Guru, he is confused and deluded
        by doubt.  || 2 ||   Not understanding that the Lord is near,
        he tells lies. In love and attachment to Maya, the fool is plundered.
        That which he seeks is within his own self, but he looks for it
        outside. Without the Guru, he is confused and deluded by doubt.
        || 3 ||   One whose good karma is recorded on his forehead serves
        the True Guru; thus the hard and heavy shutters of his mind are
        opened wide. Within his own being and beyond, he sees the Lord
        near at hand. O servant Nanak, he does not come and go in reincarnation.
        || 4 || 3 || 16 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  Who can kill that
        person whom You protect, O Lord? All beings, and the entire universe,
        is within You. The mortal thinks up millions of plans, but that
        alone happens, which the Lord of wondrous plays does.  || 1 ||
        Save me, save me, O Lord; shower me with Your Mercy. I seek
        Your Sanctuary, and Your Court.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Whoever
        serves the Fearless Lord, the Giver of Peace, is rid of all his
        fears; he knows the One Lord. Whatever You do, that alone comes
        to pass in the end. There is no other who can kill or protect
        us.  || 2 ||   What do you think, with your human understanding?
        The All-knowing Lord is the Searcher of Hearts. The One and only
        Lord is my Support and Protection. The Creator Lord knows everything.

      <p> That person who is blessed by the Creator's Glance of Grace
        - all his affairs are resolved. The One Lord is his Protector.
        O servant Nanak, no one can equal him.  || 4 || 4 || 17 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  We should feel sad, if God were beyond us. We should
        feel sad, if we forget the Lord. We should feel sad, if we are
        in love with duality. But why should we feel sad? The Lord is
        pervading everywhere.  || 1 ||   In love and attachment to Maya,
        the mortals are sad, and are consumed by sadness. Without the
        Name, they wander and wander and wander, and waste away.  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   We should feel sad, if there were another Creator
        Lord. We should feel sad, if someone dies by injustice. We should
        feel sad, if something were not known to the Lord. But why should
        we feel sad? The Lord is totally permeating everywhere.  || 2
        ||   We should feel sad, if God were a tyrant. We should feel
        sad, if He made us suffer by mistake. The Guru says that whatever
        happens is all by God's Will. So I have abandoned sadness,
        and I now sleep without anxiety.  || 3 ||   O God, You alone are
        my Lord and Master; all belong to You. According to Your Will,
        You pass judgement. There is no other at all; the One Lord is
        permeating and pervading everywhere. Please save Nanak's
        honor; I have come to Your Sanctuary.  || 4 || 5 || 18 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Without music, how is one to dance? Without a voice,
        how is one to sing? Without strings, how is a guitar to be played?
        Without the Naam, all affairs are useless.  || 1 ||   Without
        the Naam - tell me: who has ever been saved? Without the
        True Guru, how can anyone cross over to the other side?  || 1
        ||  Pause  ||   Without a tongue, how can anyone speak? Without
        ears, how can anyone hear? Without eyes, how can anyone see? Without
        the Naam, the mortal is of no account at all.  || 2 ||   Without
        learning, how can one be a Pandit - a religious scholar?
        Without power, what is the glory of an empire? Without understanding,
        how can the mind become steady? Without the Naam, the whole world
        is insane.  || 3 ||   Without detachment, how can one be a detached
        hermit? Without renouncing egotism, how can anyone be a renunciate?
        Without overcoming the five thieves, how can the mind be subdued?
        Without the Naam, the mortal regrets and repents forever and ever.
        || 4 ||   Without the Guru's Teachings, how can anyone
        obtain spiritual wisdom? Without seeing - tell me: how
        can anyone visualize in meditation? Without the Fear of God, all
        speech in useless. Says Nanak, this is the wisdom of the Lord's
        Court.  || 5 || 6 || 19 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  Mankind is
        afflicted with the disease of egotism. The disease of sexual desire
        overwhelms the elephant. Because of the disease of vision, the
        moth is burnt to death. Because of the disease of the sound of
        the bell, the deer is lured to its death.  || 1 ||   Whoever I
        see is diseased. Only my True Guru, the True Yogi, is free of
        disease.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Because of the disease of taste,
        the fish is caught. Because of the disease of smell, the bumble
        bee is destroyed. The whole world is caught in the disease of
        attachment. In the disease of the three qualities, corruption
        is multiplied.  || 2 ||   In disease the mortals die, and in disease
        they are born. <br>

      <p> In disease they wander in reincarnation again and again. Entangled
        in disease, they cannot stay still, even for an instant. Without
        the True Guru, the disease is never cured.  || 3 || When the Supreme
        Lord God grants His Mercy, He grabs hold of the mortal's
        arm, and pulls him up and out of the disease. Reaching the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the mortal's bonds are
        broken. Says Nanak, the Guru cures him of the disease.  || 4 ||
        7 || 20 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  When He comes to mind, then
        I am in supreme bliss. When He comes to mind, then all my pains
        are shattered. When He comes to mind, my hopes are fulfilled.
        When He comes to mind, I never feel sadness.  || 1 ||   Deep within
        my being, my Sovereign Lord King has revealed Himself to me. The
        Perfect Guru has inspired me to love Him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        When He comes to mind, I am the king of all. When He comes to
        mind, all my affairs are completed. When He comes to mind, I am
        dyed in the deep crimson of His Love. When He comes to mind, I
        am ecstatic forever.  || 2 ||   When He comes to mind, I am wealthy
        forever. When He comes to mind, I am free of doubt forever. When
        He comes to mind, then I enjoy all pleasures. When He comes to
        mind, I am rid of fear.  || 3 ||   When He comes to mind, I find
        the home of peace and poise. When He comes to mind, I am absorbed
        in the Primal Void of God. When He comes to mind, I continually
        sing the Kirtan of His Praises. Nanak's mind is pleased
        and satisfied with the Lord God.  || 4 || 8 || 21 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  My Father is Eternal, forever alive. My brothers
        live forever as well. My friends are permanent and imperishable.
        My family abides in the home of the self within.  || 1 ||   I
        have found peace, and so all are at peace. The Perfect Guru has
        united me with my Father.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My mansions are
        the highest of all. My countries are infinite and uncountable.
        My kingdom is eternally stable. My wealth is inexhaustible and
        permanent.  || 2 ||   My glorious reputation resounds throughout
        the ages. My fame has spread in all places and interspaces. My
        praises echo in each and every house. My devotional worship is
        known to all people.  || 3 ||   My Father has revealed Himself
        within me. The Father and son have joined together in partnership.
        Says Nanak, when my Father is pleased, then the Father and son
        are joined together in love, and become one.  || 4 || 9 || 22
        ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  The True Guru, the Primal Being, is
        free of revenge and hate; He is God, the Great Giver. I am a sinner;
        You are my Forgiver. That sinner, who finds no protection anywhere
        - if he comes seeking Your Sanctuary, then he becomes immaculate
        and pure.  || 1 ||   Pleasing the True Guru, I have found peace.
        Meditating on the Guru, I have obtained all fruits and rewards.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I humbly bow to the Supreme Lord God, the
        True Guru. My mind and body are Yours; all the world is Yours.
        When the veil of illusion is removed, then I come to see You.
        You are my Lord and Master; You are the King of all.  || 2 ||
        When it pleases Him, even dry wood becomes green. When it pleases
        Him, rivers flow across the desert sands. When it pleases Him,
        all fruits and rewards are obtained.<br>

      <p> Grasping hold of the Guru's feet, my anxiety is dispelled.
        || 3 ||   I am unworthy and ungrateful, but He has been merciful
        to me. My mind and body have been cooled and soothed; the Ambrosial
        Nectar rains down in my mind. The Supreme Lord God, the Guru,
        has become kind and compassionate to me. Slave Nanak beholds the
        Lord, enraptured.  || 4 || 10 || 23 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:
        My True Guru is totally independent. My True Guru is adorned
        with Truth. My True Guru is the Giver of all. My True Guru is
        the Primal Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny.  || 1 ||  
        There is no deity equal to the Guru. Whoever has good destiny
        inscribed on his forehead, applies himself to seva - selfless
        service.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My True Guru is the Sustainer and
        Cherisher of all. My True Guru kills and revives. The glorious
        greatness of my True Guru has become manifest everywhere.  ||
        2 ||   My True Guru is the power of the powerless. My True Guru
        is my home and court. I am forever a sacrifice to the True Guru.
        He has shown me the path.  || 3 ||   One who serves the Guru is
        not afflicted with fear. One who serves the Guru does not suffer
        in pain. Nanak has studied the Simritees and the Vedas. There
        is no difference between the Supreme Lord God and the Guru.  ||
        4 || 11 || 24 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  Repeating the Naam,
        the Name of the Lord, the mortal is exalted and glorified. Repeating
        the Naam, sin is banished from the body. Repeating the Naam, all
        festivals are celebrated. Repeating the Naam, one is cleansed
        at the sixty-eight sacred shrines.  || 1 ||   My sacred shrine
        of pilgrimage is the Name of the Lord. The Guru has instructed
        me in the true essence of spiritual wisdom.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
        Repeating the Naam, the mortal's pains are taken away.
        Repeating the Naam, the most ignorant people become spiritual
        teachers. Repeating the Naam, the Divine Light blazes forth. Repeating
        the Naam, one's bonds are broken.  || 2 ||   Repeating
        the Naam, the Messenger of Death does not draw near. Repeating
        the Naam, one finds peace in the Court of the Lord. Repeating
        the Naam, God gives His Approval. The Naam is my true wealth.
        || 3 ||   The Guru has instructed me in these sublime teachings.
        The Kirtan of the Lord's Praises and the Naam are the Support
        of the mind. Nanak is saved through the atonement of the Naam.
        Other actions are just to please and appease the people.  || 4
        || 12 || 25 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  I bow in humble worship,
        tens of thousands of times. I offer this mind as a sacrifice.
        Meditating in remembrance on Him, sufferings are erased. Bliss
        wells up, and no disease is contracted.  || 1 ||   Such is the
        diamond, the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. Chanting it,
        all works are perfectly completed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Beholding
        Him, the house of pain is demolished. The mind seizes the cooling,
        soothing, Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam. Millions of devotees worship
        His Feet. He is the Fulfiller of all the mind's desires.
        || 2 ||   In an instant, He fills the empty to over-flowing.
        In an instant, He transforms the dry into green. In an instant,
        He gives the homeless a home. <br>

        The One Lord is totally pervading and permeating all. He alone
        meditates on the Lord, whose True Guru is Perfect. Such a person
        has the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises for his Support. Says
        Nanak, the Lord Himself is merciful to him.  || 4 || 13 || 26
        ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  I was discarded and abandoned, but
        He has embellished me. He has blessed me with beauty and His Love;
        through His Name, I am exalted. All my pains and sorrows have
        been eradicated. The Guru has become my Mother and Father.  ||
        1 ||   O my friends and companions, my household is in bliss.
        Granting His Grace, my Husband Lord has met me.  || 1 ||  Pause
        ||   The fire of desire has been extinguished, and all my desires
        have been fulfilled. The darkness has been dispelled, and the
        Divine Light blazes forth. The Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad,
        the Word of God, is wondrous and amazing! Perfect is the Grace
        of the Perfect Guru.  || 2 ||   That person, unto whom the Lord
        reveals Himself - by the Blessed Vision of his Darshan,
        I am forever enraptured. He obtains all virtues and so many treasures.
        The True Guru blesses him with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
        || 3 ||   That person who meets with his Lord and Master -
        his mind and body are cooled and soothed, chanting the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har. Says Nanak, such a humble being is pleasing
        to God; only a rare few are blessed with the dust of his feet.
        || 4 || 14 || 27 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  The mortal does
        not hesitate to think about sin. He is not ashamed to spend time
        with prostitutes. He works all day long, but when it is time to
        remember the Lord, then a heavy stone falls on his head.  || 1
        ||   Attached to Maya, the world is deluded and confused. The
        Deluder Himself has deluded the mortal, and now he is engrossed
        in worthless worldly affairs.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Gazing on
        Maya's illusion, its pleasures pass away. He loves the
        shell, and ruins his life. Bound to blind worldly affairs, his
        mind wavers and wanders. The Creator Lord does not come into his
        mind.  || 2 ||   Working and working like this, he only obtains
        pain, and his affairs of Maya are never completed. His mind is
        saturated with sexual desire, anger and greed. Wiggling like a
        fish out of water, he dies.  || 3 ||   One who has the Lord Himself
        as his Protector, chants and meditates forever on the Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
        he chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord. O Nanak, he has found
        the Perfect True Guru.  || 4 || 15 || 28 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  He alone obtains it, unto whom the Lord shows Mercy. He
        enshrines the Name of the Lord in his mind. With the True Word
        of the Shabad in his heart and mind, the sinful residues of countless
        incarnations vanish.  || 1 ||   The Lord's Name is the
        Support of the soul. By Guru's Grace, chant the Name continually,
        O Siblings of Destiny; It shall carry you across the world-ocean.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those who have this treasure of the Lord's
        Name written in their destiny, those humble beings are honored
        in the Court of the Lord. Singing His Glorious Praises with peace,
        poise and bliss, even the homeless obtain a home hereafter.  ||
        2 ||   Throughout the ages, this has been the essence of reality. <br>

      <p> Meditate in remembrance on the Lord, and contemplate the Truth.
        He alone is attached to the hem of the Lord's robe, whom
        the Lord Himself attaches. Asleep for countless incarnations,
        he now awakens.  || 3 ||   Your devotees belong to You, and You
        belong to Your devotees. You Yourself inspire them to chant Your
        Praises. All beings and creatures are in Your Hands. Nanak's
        God is always with him.  || 4 || 16 || 29 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH
        MEHL:  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Inner-knower of
        my heart. The Naam is so useful to me. The Lord's Name
        permeates each and every hair of mine. The Perfect True Guru has
        given me this gift.  || 1 ||   The Jewel of the Naam is my treasure.
        It is inaccessible, priceless, infinite and incomparable.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Naam is my unmoving, unchanging Lord and
        Master. The glory of the Naam spreads over the whole world. The
        Naam is my perfect master of wealth. The Naam is my independence.
        || 2 ||   The Naam is my food and love. The Naam is the objective
        of my mind. By the Grace of the Saints, I never forget the Naam.
        Repeating the Naam, the Unstruck Sound-current of the Naad resounds.
        || 3 ||   By God's Grace, I have obtained the nine treasures
        of the Naam. By Guru's Grace, I am tuned in to the Naam.
        They alone are wealthy and supreme, O Nanak, who have the treasure
        of the Naam.  || 4 || 17 || 30 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  You
        are my Father, and You are my Mother. You are my Soul, my Breath
        of Life, the Giver of Peace. You are my Lord and Master; I am
        Your slave. Without You, I have no one at all.  || 1 ||   Please
        bless me with Your Mercy, God, and give me this gift, that I may
        sing Your Praises, day and night.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am Your
        musical instrument, and You are the Musician. I am Your beggar;
        please bless me with Your charity, O Great Giver. By Your Grace,
        I enjoy love and pleasures. You are deep within each and every
        heart.  || 2 ||   By Your Grace, I chant the Name. In the Saadh
        Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing Your Glorious Praises.
        In Your Mercy, You take away our pains. By Your Mercy, the heart-lotus
        blossoms forth.  || 3 ||   I am a sacrifice to the Divine Guru.
        The Blessed Vision of His Darshan is fruitful and rewarding; His
        service is immaculate and pure. Be Merciful to me, O my Lord God
        and Master, that Nanak may continually sing Your Glorious Praises.
        || 4 || 18 || 31 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  His Regal Court
        is the highest of all. I humbly bow to Him, forever and ever.
        His place is the highest of the high. Millions of sinful residues
        are erased by the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   In His Sanctuary,
        we find eternal peace. He Mercifully unites us with Himself. 
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   His wondrous actions cannot even be described.
        All hearts rest their faith and hope in Him. He is manifest in
        the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. The devotees lovingly
        worship and adore Him night and day.  || 2 ||   He gives, but
        His treasures are never exhausted. In an instant, He establishes
        and disestablishes. No one can erase the Hukam of His Command.

        servant. Nanak sings His Praises.  || 4 || 1 || 9 || 32 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  The whiner whines every day. His attachment to his
        household and entanglements cloud his mind. If someone becomes
        detached through understanding, he will not have to suffer in
        birth and death again.  || 1 ||   All of his conflicts are extensions
        of his corruption. How rare is that person who takes the Naam
        as his Support.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The three-phased Maya infects
        all. Whoever clings to it suffers pain and sorrow. There is no
        peace without meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. By
        great good fortune, the treasure of the Naam is received.  ||
        2 ||   One who loves the actor in his mind, later regrets it when
        the actor takes off his costume. The shade from a cloud is transitory,
        like the worldly paraphernalia of attachment and corruption. 
        || 3 ||   If someone is blessed with the singular substance, then
        all of his tasks are accomplished to perfection. One who obtains
        the Naam, by Guru's Grace - O Nanak, his coming
        into the world is certified and approved.  || 4 || 20 || 33 ||
        BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  Slandering the Saints, the mortal wanders
        in reincarnation. Slandering the Saints, he is diseased. Slandering
        the Saints, he suffers in pain. The slanderer is punished by the
        Messenger of Death.  || 1 ||   Those who argue and fight with
        the Saints - those slanderers find no happiness at all.
        || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Slandering the devotees, the wall of the
        mortal's body is shattered. Slandering the devotees, he
        suffers in hell. Slandering the devotees, he rots in the womb.
        Slandering the devotees, he loses his realm and power.  || 2 ||
        The slanderer finds no salvation at all. He eats only that which
        he himself has planted. He is worse than a thief, a lecher, or
        a gambler. The slanderer places an unbearable burden upon his
        head.  || 3 ||   The devotees of the Supreme Lord God are beyond
        hate and vengeance. Whoever worships their feet is emancipated.
        The Primal Lord God has deluded and confused the slanderer. O
        Nanak, the record of one's past actions cannot be erased.
        || 4 || 21 || 34 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Naam, the Name
        of the Lord, is for me the Vedas and the Sound-current of the
        Naad. Through the Naam, my tasks are perfectly accomplished. The
        Naam is my worship of deities. The Naam is my service to the Guru.
        || 1 ||   The Perfect Guru has implanted the Naam within me.
        The highest task of all is the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  ||
        1 ||  Pause  ||   The Naam is my cleansing bath and purification.
        The Naam is my perfect donation of charity. Those who repeat the
        Naam are totally purified. Those who chant the Naam are my friends
        and Siblings of Destiny.  || 2 ||   The Naam is my auspicious
        omen and good fortune. The Naam is the sublime food which satisfies
        me. The Naam is my good conduct. The Naam is my immaculate occupation.
        || 3 ||   All those humble beings whose minds are filled with
        the One God have the Support of the Lord, Har, Har. O Nanak, sing
        the Glorious Praises of the Lord with your mind and body. <br>

        are fulfilled, and one's tasks are perfectly accomplished.
        You bestow Your Name upon Your devotee.  || 1 ||   Service to
        the Lord, our Sovereign King, is fruitful and rewarding. Our Lord
        and Master is the Creator, the Cause of causes; no one is turned
        away from His Door empty-handed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God eradicates
        the disease from the diseased person. God takes away the sorrows
        of the suffering. And those who have no place at all -
        You seat them upon the place. You link Your slave to devotional

        fear disappears. The Lord dwells within the mind of His humble
        servant.  || 3 ||   The Supreme Lord God is the Treasure of Peace.
        The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is the essence of reality. Granting
        His Grace, He enjoins the mortals to serve the Saints. O Nanak,
        such a person merges in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
        || 4 || 23 || 36 ||   BHAIRAO,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the Realm of
        the Saints, the Lord dwells in the mind. In the Realm of the Saints,
        all sins run away. In the Realm of the Saints, one's lifestyle
        is immaculate. In the Society of the Saints, one comes to love
        the One Lord.  || 1 ||   That alone is called the Realm of the
        Saints, where only the Glorious Praises of the Supreme Lord God
        are sung.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In the Realm of the Saints, birth
        and death are ended. In the Realm of the Saints, the Messenger
        of Death cannot touch the mortal. In the Society of the Saints,
        one's speech becomes immaculate.  || 2 ||   The Realm of
        the Saints is the eternal, ever-stable place. In the Realm of
        the Saints, sins are destroyed. In the Realm of the Saints, the
        immaculate sermon is spoken. In the Society of the Saints, the
        pain of egotism runs away.  || 3 ||   The Realm of the Saints
        cannot be destroyed. In the Realm of the Saints, is the Lord,
        the Treasure of Virtue. The Realm of the Saints is the resting
        place of our Lord and Master. O Nanak, He is woven into the fabric
        of His devotees, through and through.  || 4 || 24 || 37 ||   BHAIRAO,
        FIFTH MEHL:  Why worry about disease, when the Lord Himself protects
        us? That person whom the Lord protects, does not suffer pain and
        sorrow. That person, upon whom God showers His Mercy -
        Death hovering above him is turned away.  || 1 ||   The Name of
        the Lord, Har, Har, is forever our Help and Support. When He comes
        to mind, the mortal finds lasting peace, and the Messenger of
        Death cannot even approach him.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   When this
        being did not exist, who created him then? What has been produced
        from the source? He Himself kills, and He Himself rejuvenates.
        He cherishes His devotees forever.  || 2 ||   Know that everything
        is in His Hands. My God is the Master of the masterless. His Name
        is the Destroyer of pain. Singing His Glorious Praises, you shall
        find peace.  || 3 ||   O my Lord and Master, please listen to
        the prayer of Your Saint. I place my soul, my breath of life and
        wealth before You. All this world is Yours; it meditates on You. </p>
