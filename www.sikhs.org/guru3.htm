          <p><img src="images\guru3.jpg" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru 
          Amar Das was born in the village of Basarke on May 5, 1479. He was the 
          eldest son of Tej Bhan a farmer and trader. Guru Amar Das grew up and 
          married Mansa Devi and had two sons Mohri and Mohan and two daughters 
          Dani and Bhani. He was a very religious Vaishanavite Hindu who spent 
          most of his life performing all of the ritual pilgrimages and fasts 
          of a devout Hindu.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It was not until 
              his old age that Amar Das met Guru Angad and converted to the path of 
              Sikhism. He eventually became Guru at the age of 73 succeeding Guru 
              Angad as described previously.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Soon large numbers 
                of Sikhs started flocking to Goindwal to see the new Guru. Datu one 
                of Guru Angad's sons proclaimed himself as Guru at Khadur following 
                his fathers death. He was so jealous of Guru Amar Das that he proceeded 
                to Goindwal to confront the Guru. Upon seeing Guru Amar Das seated on 
                a throne surrounded by his followers he said; "You were a mere menial 
                servant of the house until yesterday and how dare you style yourself 
                as the Master?", he then proceeded to kick the revered old Guru, throwing 
                him off his throne. Guru Amar Das in his utter humility started caressing 
                Datu's foot saying; "I'm old. My bones are hard. You may have been hurt." 
          As demanded by Datu, Guru Amar Das left Goindwal the same evening are 
          returned to his native village of Basarke. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here Guru Amar 
                  Das shut himself in a small house for solitary meditation. There he 
                  attached a notice on the front door saying, "He who opens this door 
                  is no Sikh of mine, nor am I his Guru." A delegation of faithful Sikhs 
                  led by Baba Buddha found the house and seeing the notice on the front 
                  door, cut through the walls to reach the Guru. Baba Buddha said, "The 
                  Guru being a supreme yogi, cares for nothing in the world - neither 
                  fame, nor riches nor a following. But we cannot live without his guidance. 
                  Guru Angad has tied us to your apron, where should we go now if you 
                  are not to show us the way?" At the tearful employment of the Sikhs, 
                  Guru Amar Das was overwhelmed by their devotion and returned to Goindwal. 
                  Datu having been unable to gather any followers of his own had returned 
                  to Khadur.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Amar Das further 
                    institutionalized the free communal kitchen called langer among the 
                    Sikhs. The langar kitchen was open to serve all day and night. Although 
                    rich food was served there, Guru Amar Das was very simple and lived 
                    on coarse bread. The Guru spent his time personally attending to the 
                    cure and nursing of the sick and the aged. Guru Amar Das made it obligatory 
                    that those seeking his audience must first eat in the langer. When the 
                    Raja of Haripur came to see the Guru. Guru Amar Das insisted that he 
                    first partake a common meal in the langer, irrespective of his cast. 
                    The Raja obliged and had an audience with the Guru. But on of his queens 
                    refused to lift the veil from her face, so Guru Amar Das refused to 
                    meet her. Guru Amar Das not only preached the equality of people irrespective 
                    of their caste but he also tried to foster the idea of women's equality. 
                    He tried to liberate women from the practices of purdah (wearing a veil) 
                    as well as preaching strongly against the practice of sati (Hindu wife 
                    burning on her husbands funeral pyre). Guru Amar Das also disapproved 
                    of a widow remaining unmarried for the rest of her life.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Goindwal continued 
                      to experience growth as many Sikhs thronged there for spiritual guidance. 
                      Pilgrims moved there in large numbers to be close to the Guru. Muslims 
                      and Hindus also moved to the thriving town. When there was racial fighting 
                      between the three groups and calls for revenge, Guru Angad instructed 
                      his Sikhs; "In God's house, justice is sure. It is only a matter of 
                      time. The arrow of humility and patience on the part of the innocent 
                      and the peaceful never fail in their aim."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Once during several 
                        days of rain while Guru Amar Das was riding by a wall which he saw was 
                        on the verge of falling he galloped his horse past the wall. The Sikhs 
                        questioned him saying; "O Master, you have instructed us, 'fear not 
                        death, for it comes to all' and 'the Guru and the God-man are beyond 
                        the pale of birth and death', why did you then gallop past the collapsing 
                        wall?" Guru Amar Das replied; "Our body is the embodiment of God's light. 
                        It is through the human body that one can explore one's limitless spiritual 
                        possibilities. Demi-god's envy the human frame. One should not, therefore, 
                        play with it recklessly. One must submit to the Will of God, when one's 
                        time is over, but not crave death, nor invite it without a sufficient 
                        and noble cause. It is self surrender for the good of man that one should 
                        seek, not physical annihilation. "</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> With a view of 
                          providing the Sikhs with a place where they could have a holy dip while 
                          visiting Goindwal the Guru had a type of deep open water reservoir called 
                          a baoli dug. As the Hindus believed in reincarnation in 84 hundred thousand 
                          species, Guru Amar Das had the well dug with exactly 84 steps. To symbolize 
                          that God could be reached through his remembrance rather than just a 
                          cycle of reincarnations he declared that who ever would descend the 
                          84 steps for a bath while reciting the Japji of Guru Nanak at each step 
                          would be freed from the cycles of births and deaths.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When it came time 
                            for the Guru to marry his younger daughter Bibi Bani, he selected a 
                            pious and diligent young follower of his called Jetha from Lahore. Jetha 
                            had come to visit the Guru with a party of pilgrims from Lahore and 
                            had become so enchanted by the Guru's teachings that he had decided 
                            to settle in Goindwal. Here he earned a living selling wheat and would 
                            regularly attend the services of Guru Amar Das in his spare time.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1567 while on 
                              his way to Lahore the Emperor Akbar decided to visit and see for himself 
                              Guru Amar Das. He stopped at Goindwal to meet the Guru, whose teachings 
                              he had heard about. The Guru agreed only to seem Akbar if he would first 
                              eat in the langer. Akbar agreed and here the Emperor sat down and ate 
                              with the poorest of the poor in his company. Akbar was so impressed 
                              by Guru Amar Das that he wanted to give the Guru a parting gift of the 
                              revenue collected from several villages to help support the langer kitchen. 
                              Guru Amar Das refused saying that the langer must be self supporting 
                              and only depend upon the small offerings of the devout.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The jealousy of 
                                the teachings of the Gurus by the high caste Khatris and Brahmins continued. 
                                They pleaded with Akbar at the royal court that the teachings of Sikhism 
                                would lead to disorder as they went against the teachings of Hindus 
                                and Muslims. Akbar summoned the Guru to his court for an explanation. 
                                Guru Amar Das politely excused himself on account of his old age, but 
                                sent Jetha to answer the charges leveled against the Sikhs. In the royal 
                                court Jetha explained the teachings of Sikhism. Akbar was open minded 
                                and deeply impressed by the religious doctrine of the Sikhs and decided 
                                that no further actions were required.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Amar Das continued 
                                  a systematic planned expansion of the Sikh Institutions. He trained 
                                  a band of 146 apostles (52 were women) called Masands and sent them 
                                  to various parts of the country. He also set up 22 dioceses called manjis 
                                  across the country. These twenty two dioceses helped to spread Sikhism 
                                  among the population while collecting revenues to help support the young 
                                  religion. Guru Amar Das also declared Baisakhi (April 13), Maghi (1st 
                                  day of Magha, mid January) and Diwali (festival of lights in October/November) 
                                  as three special days where all the Sikhs should gather to hear the 
                                  Guru's words. Although advanced in years, Guru Amar Das undertook a 
                                  tour of a number of Hindu places of pilgrimage along the banks of the 
                                  Yamuna and Ganga rivers as well as Kurukshetra. Here the Guru would 
                                  hold religious services and large numbers of people would come to hear 
                                  his preaching.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For their religious 
                                    scriptures Guru Amar Das collected an anthology of writings including 
                                    hymns of Guru Nanak and Guru Angad and added his own as well as those 
                                    of other Hindu saints whose poems conformed to the teachings of Sikhism. 
                                    All of these were in Punjabi and easily understood by the common people. 
                                    When a learned Brahmin once questioned the Guru; "Why do you impart 
                                    instruction to your disciples not in Sanskrit, the language of gods 
                                    in which all the Hindu lore is written, but in their mother-tongue, 
                                    like Punjabi, the language of the illiterate mass." To this Guru Amar 
                                    Das replied; "Sanskrit is like a well, deep, inaccessible and confined 
                                    to the elite, but the language of the people is like rain water - ever 
                                    fresh, abundant and accessible to all." He said; "I want my doctrines 
                                    to be propagated through every language which the people speak, for 
                                    it is not language but the content that should be considered sacred 
                                    or otherwise."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Seeing the rapid 
                                      expansion of Sikhism, Guru Amar Das asked his son-in-law and trusted 
                                      follower Jetha to oversee the founding of another city. He wanted him 
                                      to dig a tank there and to build himself a house. Jetha first purchased 
                                      the lands for the price of 700 Akbari rupees from the Zamindars of Tung. 
                                      Here he started the digging on the tank. This new township called Ramdaspur 
                                      would in due time become present day Amritsar, the holiest city of the 
                                      Sikhs.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On September 1, 
                                        1574 sensing that his end was near, Guru Amar Das sent for Baba Buddha 
                                        and other prominent Sikhs including his tow sons Mohan and Mohri. He 
                                        declared; "According to the tradition established by Guru Nanak, the 
                                        leadership of the Sikhs must go to the most deserving. I, therefore, 
                                        bestow this honour on my son-in-law Jetha." Guru Amar Das then renamed 
                                        Jetha as Ram Das, meaning Servant of God. As was the custom Baba Buddha 
                                        was asked to anoint the forehead of Amar Das with the saffron mark. 
                                        All those present bowed before Guru Ram Das except for Mohan, Guru Amar 
                                        Das's eldest son. Shortly thereafter Guru Amar Das breathed his last 
                                        on the full moon day of Bhadon in 1574 at the ripe old age of 95.</font>
