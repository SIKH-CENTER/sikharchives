  Mardana (1459 to 1520)</font></h3>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bhai Mardana was 
        the lifelong companion and first disciple of Guru Nanak. Bhai Mardana 
        was born in 1459 at Nankana Sahib to Muslim parents Bhai Badre and Mai 
        Lakho. He belonged to a caste of musicians which sang and danced at festivals 
        and weddings. Bhai Mardana became friends with Guru Nanak when they were 
        both children, Mardana being 10 years older than Guru Nanak. Bhai Mardana 
        accompanied Guru Nanak on most of his great journeys, he would play the 
        rebeck (a string instrument) while Guru Nanak would be singing and composing 
        his hymns. Three of Bhai Mardana's hymns are included in the Guru Granth 
        Sahib. Bhai Mardana passed away in 1520 on the banks of the river Khuram 
        in Afghanastan. He was returning with Guru Nanak on the Gurus fourth and 
        last great journey to Mecca and Medina. Guru Nanak personally performed 
        the last rites of Bhai Mardana. Bhai Mardana is considered the founder 
        of the musical tradition of the Sikhs. </font>

  <font size="3">Baba Buddha (1506 to 1631)</font></font></h3>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Baba Buddha was 
        the great Sikh saint who had the pleasure of serving under the first six 
        Gurus. Baba Buddha was born in 1506 in the village of Kathu Nangal. When 
        he was a young boy herding cattle in the fields when he met Guru Nanak 
        who was visiting the village. The boy served the Guru milk and Guru Nanak 
        exclaimed that though young in age, he was a Buddha (old man) in terms 
        of his understanding and wisdom. Baba Buddha converted to the path of 
        Sikhism and became an exemplary disciple of the Gurus. Baba Buddha was 
        responsible for the guruship ceremony of the next five Gurus from Guru 
        Angad to Guru Hargobind. Under Guru Arjan Dev, Baba Buddha was appointed 
        the first custodian (granthi) of the Guru Granth Sahib in the Golden Temple 
        in 1604. Baba Buddha was also responsible for the early education of Guru 
        Hargobind as a child and helped to personally construct the Akal Takht. 
        Baba Buddha passed away in 1631 at village Ramdas and had his last rites 
        personally performed by Guru Hargobind. </font>

  <font size="3">Bhai Gurdas (1560 to 1629)</font></font></h3>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bhai Gurdas was 
        a great Sikh scholar who was the scribe of the original copy of the Guru 
        Granth Sahib under the guidance of Guru Arjan Dev. Bhai Gurdas was born 
        around 1560 at Goindwal and was the son of Datar Chand, the younger brother 
        of Guru Amar Das. Bhai Gurdas learned Sikhism from his uncle Guru Amar 
        Das and upon the Gurus death was sent by Guru Ram Das as a missionary 
        to preach Sikhism at Agra. Under the guidance of Guru Arjan Dev, Bhai 
        Gurdas spent a year with the Guru at Armitsar and helped to scribe the 
        original copy of the Guru Granth Sahib. Bhai Gurdas also met the mughal 
        emperor Akbar and convinced him that the Guru Granth Sahib was not derogatory 
        to Islam. Bhai Gurdas was also a great writer and provides the best information 
        that we have about the early days of Sikhism. He composes 40 vars (ballads) 
        and 556 kabits (couplets) which Guru Arjan blessed as being "the key 
        to the Guru Granth Sahib". Out of his humility Bhai Gurdas did not have 
        any of his compositions included in the Guru Granth Sahib, but they are 
        part of the writings outside the Guru Granth Sahib that are approved for 
        recital by Sikhs. While Guru Hargobind was imprisoned at Gwalior Fort, 
        Bhai Gurdas along with Baba Buddha were in charge of running the affairs 
        of the Sikh community. Bhai Gurdas also helped to construct the Akal Takht. 
        Bhai Gurdas died in 1629 at Goindwal and had his last rites personally 
        performed by Guru Hargobind. </font>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bhai Nand Lal 
        was a great poet and close associate of Guru Gobind Singh. Bhai Nand Lal 
        was born in 1633 at Ghazni where his father was a high government official. 
        Bhai Nand Lal became an accomplished poet and was fluent in Persian and 
        Arabic. He married a Sikh girl and eventually became a disciple of Guru 
        Gobind Singh. He lived in close association with the Guru from 1697 onwards. 
        Bhai Nand Lal personally accompanied Guru Gobind Singh to Deccan where 
        the Guru was assassinated. Bhai Nand Lal produced a number of works about 
        the teaching of Guru Gobind Singh and the code of conduct he laid down. 
        The works of Bhai Nand Lal are given equal respect as those of Bhai Gurdas 
        and are read in gurdwaras. Bhai Nand Lal died in 1715 at Multan. </font>

  <font size="3">The Panj Piaras (The Five Beloved Ones)</font></font></h3>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Panj Piaras 
        were the first five Sikhs to be initiated into the Khalsa brotherhood 
        by Guru Gobind Singh on Baisakhi day in 1699. A very large gathering of 
        Sikhs had arrived at Anandpur Sahib on that day as per the Gurus instructions. 
        After prayers Guru Gobind Singh stood up with his sword and asked the 
        large congregation, "Is there anyone here ready to lay down his life at 
        my call? This sword of mine is crying for the blood of a dear Sikh of 
        mine." The congregation was shocked and afraid, the third time Guru Gobind 
        Singh repeated his call, Daya Ram stood up and offered his head. Guru 
        Gobind Singh took him into a tent. The sound of a sword cutting a body 
        was heard and blood trickled out of the tent. Guru Gobind Singh emerged 
        from the tent and asked for another Sikh. Dharam Das stood up and volunteered. 
        Again the same episode was repeated. Three more Sikhs offered their heads 
        to the Guru in the same way, Mukham Chand, Himmat Rai and Sahib Chand. 
        After some time Guru Gobind Singh brought the five Sikhs before the congregation 
        dressed in new clothes. Guru Gobind Singh then baptized 
        them with amrit (sweetened water) stirred with his Khanda, The Guru called 
        them his Beloved Ones and gave them the last name 'Singh' which means 
        Lion. Guru Gobind Singh then humbly bowed before the Five Beloved Ones 
        and asked them to initiate Him into the Khalsa Brotherhood. All of the 
        Five Beloved Ones remained with Guru Gobind Singh for the rest of their 
        lives and they are remembered every day in Ardas (the common prayer).</font>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bhai Mani Singh 
        was a great Sikh scholar and martyr who was the scribe of the final version 
        of the Guru Granth Sahib under the guidance of Guru Gobind Singh and who 
        compiled the Dasam Granth following the death of Guru Gobind Singh. Bhai 
        Mani Singh was born to Jat parents at the village of Sunam in 1670. He 
        was the younger brother of Bhai Dyala who was martyred along with Guru 
        Tegh Bahadur in 1675. Bhai Mani Singh was raised from a young age with 
        Guru Gobind Singh by the Gurus mother Mata Gujri. Bhai Mani Singh became 
        a great preacher of Sikhism and spent almost a year with Guru Gobind Singh 
        at Damdama Sahib compiling the final and current version of the Guru Granth 
        Sahib in 1705. After the death of Guru Gobind Singh, Bhai Mani Singh was 
        installed as the head granthi at the Golden Temple in 1721. Here he produced 
        many works on Sikhism and under the insistence of Guru Gobind Singhs widow 
        Mata Sundri compiled the works of Guru Gobind Singh and produced the Dasam 
        Granth. In 1737 Bhai Mani Singh took permission from the muslim governor 
        of Lahore for the Sikhs to celebrate Diwali at the Golden Temple on the 
        payment of Rs. 5,000 as tax, a practice which had been banned. Not enough 
        people attended Diwali that year because they were afraid of the muslim 
        authorities and as a result not enough money was collected. The muslim 
        authorities arrested Bhai Mani Singh and publicly executed him in Lahore.

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The great Sikh 
        soldier and martyr who avenged the death of Guru Gobind Singhs two younger 
        sons. He was born as Lachhman Das in 1670 at Rajouri in Jammu to Rajput 
        parents. He spent many years in hindu monasteries in central India and 
        established a ashram at Nanded in Maharashtra where he lived for fifteen 
        years before meeting Guru Gobind Singh. He was given the name "Banda" 
        meaning slave of the Guru and became a Khalsa. His name was changed to 
        Gurbax Singh but he was popularly known as Banda. When Guru Gobind Singh 
        was in the south at Deccan he sent Banda to Punjab to punish the enemies 
        of the Khalsa. He attacked Samana in 1709 and captured Sirhind in 1710. 
        The killer of Guru Gobind Singh's two sons Wazir Khan the ruler of Sirhind 
        was also killed. Banda Singh Bahadur became the leader of the Khalsa following 
        the death of Guru Gobind Singh and struck coins in the name of Guru Gobind 
        Singh. In 1712 Banda conquered the Lohgarh Fort. A huge army of 20,000 
        men amassed by the muslim governor of Lahore besieged Banda for eight 
        months at a fort in Gurdaspur in 1715. Banda Singh Bahadur along with 
        600 Sikhs were finally captured and brought to Delhi where they were all 
        tortured to death for refusing to convert to Islam. </font>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Baba Deep Singh 
        was a great Sikh scholar who became a soldier and martyr for the defense 
        of Sikhism. Not much is know about his early life but when he visited 
        Anandpur Sahib in 1700, he became a Khalsa and decided to stay. There 
        he learned Gurmukhi from Bhai Mani Singh along with horse riding, archery 
        as well as other arms training. Baba Deep Singh met Guru Gobind Singh 
        at Damdama Sahib where Guru Gobind Singh told him to start preaching the 
        message of Sikhism. Between 1715 and 1728 Baba Deep Singh and Bhai Mani 
        Singh produced a number of hand written copies of the Guru Granth Sahib 
        for distribution among the Sikhs. When Bhai Mani Singh became the head 
        granthi at the Golden Temple, Baba Deep Singh stayed on as the head at 
        Damdama Sahib. In 1710 Baba Deep Singh joined Banda Singh Bahadur in the 
        battle of Sirhind. Baba Deep Singh was also a survivor of the Chotta Ghalughara 
        (Small Holocaust) in 1755 when 10,000 Sikhs were killed. In 1762 Ahmed 
        Shah Abdhali the Afghan invader ordered the Golden Temple blown up and 
        the sacred pool filled in with refuse. Baba Deep Singh came out of scholarly 
        retirement at Damdama Sahib and asked Sikhs to march with him to Amritsar 
        to avenge the desecration. Along the way to Amritsar 5,000 Sikhs joined 
        Baba Deep Singh. On the outskirts of Amritsar Baba Deep Singh and the 
        heavily outnumbered Sikhs fought two fierce battles against a mughal force 
        of 20,000. In the second engagement Baba Deep Singh was fatally wounded 
        in the neck but had vowed to die in the precincts of the Golden Temple. 
        Although mortally wounded Baba Deep Singh was able to continue fighting 
        until he was able to make his way to the Sacred Pool of the Golden Temple

              was born in March 1689. Both brothers received religious education 
              as well as training in the weapons of war. During the battle of 
              Chamkaur in 1704 in which the Guru and 40 Sikhs fought against overwhelming 
              odds, both brothers died in battle. During the battle Baba Ajit 
              Singh asked his fathers permission to go out of the fort and fight 
              the enemy. He said, "Dear father, my name is Ajit or Unconquerable.

              he fought heroically until his last breath. Baba Jujhar Singh having

              with his religion. We should follow his example. We have received 
              the baptism of the spirit and the sword. We are the Guru's lions. 
              Why should we fear death? It is best that we should give up our 
              lives for the sake of our religion. I am prepared to die". Baba 
              Zorawar Singh replied, "That is good, indeed. The blood of Guru 
              Arjan, Guru Hargobind, Guru Tegh Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh runs 
              in our veins. We are their descendants. We cannot do anything unworthy 
              of our family". Both sons were bricked up in a wall and had their 
              heads cut off but they steadfastly refused to convert to Islam.</font>
