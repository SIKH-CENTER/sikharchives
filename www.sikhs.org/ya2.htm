          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Religious Labels 
          </b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru Nanak, the 
          First Sikh Master, was born in 1469 in Punjab, India. He protested against 
          the widespread social injustice, arguments and fights over religious 
          labels, superstition and empty rituals being promoted as religion, and 
          false display of piety. He urged everyone to have a true and ongoing 
          inner relationship with our Father. This is everyone's birthright as 
          well as a necessity. He called for pure intentions, a sincere and heartfelt 
          devotion towards God, selfless service of God in others, generosity, 
          and truthful living while earning an honest livelihood. There is no 
          need to become a recluse, either. It is possible to become a perfect 
          Saint while living in the society. This is true religion. This is the 
          aim of a Sikh's life. Two hundred years later, the Tenth Sikh Master, 
          Guru Gobind Singh, finalized the spiritual rules of this social order 
          established by Guru Nanak.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though called a 
          religion, Sikh Path is not, in the way a religion is commonly known. 
          For instance: A Sikh does not exclude or condemn any religion. He does 
          not believe that only he deserves heaven and all others are going to 
          burn in hell, etc. We are all children of the same God. A Sikh respects 
          everyone's religious sentiment and freedom to choose their own way to 
          Truth. He believes that all religions originally lead to the same truth 
          if we simply understood and followed the real teaching correctly.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Birth in a Sikh 
          household does not make one a Sikh. A Sikh (Disciple) is only he who 
          lives by the spiritual guidance of a personal Teacher (Guru). For a 
          Sikh, It is a path of spiritual return to God through following, and 
          connecting, with Gurbani (God's Word). Anyone can follow it. This is 
          why the correct name is Sikh Panth (Punjabi word for path). &quot;Sikhism&quot; 
          is a misnomer. It can be called a &quot;Religion&quot; in one way that, 
          a large number of people, born in Sikh households, call themselves Sikhs 
          without knowing what a Sikh really is! In this document, Panth means 
          the path shown by Guru Gobind Singh Ji, The Tenth Master.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sikh scripture, 
          Guru Granth Sahib, contains authentic Gurbani from Saints of diverse 
          religious origins. The Gurus also rejected many writings alleged to 
          be of the same Saints because they did not meet the criteria to be worshipped 
          as Gurbani. They included all Gurbani they could find, regardless of 
          its cultural or religious origin. Though the Sikhs are the custodians 
          of Gurbani, the Gurus addressed it to people of all faiths. Unlike some 
          religious writings, Gurbani is not a history or prediction, related 
          to some nation, etc. It is God's truth written in verse. It is for everyone. 
          God put you in your religion for a special purpose. You do not need 
          to convert in order to enjoy, understand, and take advantage of the 
          Sikh Gurus' teachings. For example, anyone can learn to be always mentally 
          aware of a unity (God) being present inside everyone.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">God neither cares 
          about the various religious labels, nor does He care how you call Him. 
          What really matters, is that we, are spiritually sincere toward Him 
          so that we do not lose our soul in the objects of the world, lead an 
          honest life with clean thoughts, love one-another as His children, and 
          take care of the poor and the oppressed. This enables us to achieve 
          the highest fulfillment of our life. A Sufi Saint, Sheikh Farid Ji summed 
          it up like this: &quot; Spiritually sincere people have an enduring 
          love of God in their heart. Unripe souls are not accepted, because their 
          words did not match their intentions. Having witnessed a True Master, 
          the Seekers live intoxicated with God's love. Others, who pass moments 
          forgetting His Name, are in fact, excessive burden to this earth.&quot; 
          (SGGS, p.488)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Often, trying to 
          follow those who brought us this simple message, we do just the opposite, 
          and argue among ourselves. A dysfunction of the human nature becomes 
          integrated with most religious practices. Awed by their Glory, and due 
          to our inner desire for magic, we worship the messengers, expecting 
          some kind of magical transformation in us, rather than put their teaching 
          into practice and become as complete as them. God wants us to follow 
          His messengers in their footsteps, not just worship them and keep waiting 
          to see them sometime later. He has already given us the miracle we are 
          waiting for. It is in following His very simple rules. God continues 
          to send someone periodically, to teach us the same lesson, again and 
          again. The same Truth has been presented in different molds to fit the 
          temperament and the environment of different people.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikh Path is not 
          a branch of a religion, as some people claim. The prevailing Hindu and 
          Muslim sects influenced the Sikh rituals and its outer skeleton. However, 
          though it was not well defined till the Ten Sikh Masters, all True Seekers, 
          since the beginning, have followed this Path in some form. Truth is 
          universal. It is the same in all religions. Just as, Benjamin Franklin 
          was an American of European ancestry. Does that make electricity American 
          or European? You will notice the absurdity. The Sikh Gurus have taught 
          the Sikhs to adopt and uphold everything that is good, in any religion, 
          culture, or science. Calling the Sikhs as a part of some religion, is 
          exactly the opposite of what Gurus want to accomplish through the Panth.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru Nanak said, 
          &quot;We are neither Hindu nor Muslim, all our bodies breathe a life 
          from the same God, called Ram or Allah.&quot; Many Hindu and Muslim 
          devotees enjoy worship at the Sikh shrines. Sikhs respect the Hindu, 
          Muslim, and other places of worship the same way. Guru Nanak, The First 
          Master, was the first Sikh to show this. He happened to visit a Muslim 
          priest during the time of a Muslim prayer. Guru Nanak joined him in 
          the prayer without hesitation. Later, this priest learned from Guru 
          Nanak how to be a good and sincere Muslim. Guru Gobind Singh, The Tenth 
          Master said, &quot;The same God is worshiped in a Hindu temple and a 
          Muslim Mosque. The same God resides in the Hindu Puja and the Muslim 
          Nawaz. Yet, the appearance of variety tricks human beings.&quot; (DG, 
          p.19)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My best friend, 
          Saint Scholar Shri Naranjan Singh Ji, was well versed in Bhagwad Gita, 
          the Upnishads, Ashtavakra Samhita, Patanjali, and Bhartrihari etc., 
          as well as the western literature, beside the Sikh literature. He would 
          quote Jesus, or the Gita, without hesitation. Guru Arjan, the Fifth 
          Master wrote: &quot;Some call Him Rama, Rama, others bow to Allah, while 
          others would serve only Krishna. Some run to a Hindu pilgrimage, others 
          say only a Haj will do, while others say only Hindu Puja is accepted. 
          Some chant the Vedas others want only Koran. Lord, have mercy on them. 
          Nanak says, those who live by His will, get to know the secret truth 
          of my beloved Master (Then, all these differences become irrelevant!).&quot; 
          (SGGS, p.885)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Being a Sikh myself, 
          I will be biased. However, this is not an attempt to advertise The Guru 
          Granth Sahib, The Ten Sikh Masters, the Sikhs, or some other human &quot;Sant,&quot; 
          &quot;Guru&quot; etc. Nor is this an endorsement of, or an attempt to 
          condemn, some specific religious group. Many serious religious groups, 
          as well as some cults, use the ancient Indian, eastern, and Sikh terminology 
          (Sant, Shabda, Bani, Guru, Singh etc.) liberally, when in reality they 
          are not following the Sikh Path. Sikhs do not have an exclusive right 
          to the Ten Gurus, the teaching of Guru Granth Sahib, or to the use of 
          eastern words, either. People use them as they see fit. This results 
          in confusion.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Words can be important 
          vehicles of sacred information. However, in the present climate, highly 
          esoteric terms, like Great Master, True Guru, Sat Guru, Sant, etc., 
          are just a few more cults away from appearing on people's grocery lists. 
          Several times in the past, such a tide of ignorance has reaffirmed God's 
          reason for sending the Ten Masters to establish the Khalsa Panth. In 
          fact, the primary goal of the Ten Masters was to inoculate the society 
          against the false prophets or green gurus, and to nurture genuine Sainthood 
          in common households. This document is an attempt to remove the prevalent 
          ignorance about the True Guru, how not to get cheated by a fake guru, 
          and about the Khalsa Panth. Many readers will find this document helpful 
          in discerning the facts from fiction.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My American friends 
          think that Guru Gobind Singh must be my blood relative, because of the 
          same last name! Then I explain that he gave his own last name to all 
          the baptized Sikhs, more than three hundred years ago, because he regarded 
          them as his children. This name continues simply as a tradition among 
          people born in those households. All the Sikhs are responsible, collectively, 
          for society's confusion about some other, more serious Sikh issues. 
          For instance, a growing spiritual relationship with the Guru, which 
          is the foundation of Sikh faith, is ignored by most Sikhs. What can 
          we say? The masses are not interested in any spirituality, anyway. Similarly, 
          everything in this document will not be of interest to everyone. To 
          many, this will be just another case of verbal diarrhea, as, a news 
          poster put it very aptly.</font>
