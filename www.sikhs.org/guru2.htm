          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\guru2.jpg" align="left">The 
          son of a prosperous Hindu trader, Bhai Pheru, Guru Angad was an ardent 
          devotee of the Hindu goddess Durga. Lehna, as he was known before becoming 
          Guru was born on March 31, 1504 in the village of Matte-di-Sari but 
          eventually his family moved to Khadur. He was married to Khivi and had 
          two sons, Datu and Dasu, and one daughter Amro. Lehna would annually 
          lead groups of pilgrims to visit the temple of Durga at Jwalamukhi for 
          preying and dancing. Here the flames emitted by the volcano are worshipped 
          by devout Hindus. One day Lehna heard a Sikh named Bhai Jodha reciting 
          the Japji, the early morning prayer composed by Guru Nanak. Finding 
          out about Guru Nanak from Bhai Joda, Lehna decided to visit the Guru 
          and pay his respects. Upon meeting Guru Nanak at the age of 27, Lehna 
          became a devout disciple of Guru Nanak and renounced his former practices.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Nanak instructed 
              Lehna to return to Khadur to instruct people in the ways of Sikhism. 
              Here Lehna spent his time in prayer and serving the people. He distributed 
              food to the poor daily. Longing to be with Guru Nanak he eventually 
              returned to Karthapur where he became totally devoted to the service 
              of Guru Nanak. After undergoing countless tests, Guru Nanak eventually 
              appointed Guru Angad as his successor on July 14, 1539 as described 
              previously. Upon the death of Guru Nanak, Guru Angad returned to Khadur 
              where he went into seclusion and meditation for six months. Eventually 
              a delegation of Sikhs led by Baba Buddha convinced the Guru that they 
              needed him. Guru Angad longed for Guru Nanak, when he said to Baba Buddha;</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"He whom you love, 
                die for him. Accursed is the life without the beloved. The head should 
                be sliced that does not bow before the Master. O Nanak! the body should 
                be burnt that suffers not the agony of separation." (Sri Rag) "He who 
                has been blessed by Guru Nanak is lost in the praises of the Lord. What 
                could one teach those, Who have Divine Nanak as their Guru?" (Majh)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Angad was 
                  the embodiment of humility as Guru Nanak had been before him. The renowned 
                  yogi Daya Nath visited Guru Angad to try to convert him. Daya Nath believed 
                  that mental purity could only be obtained through renunciation of the 
                  world, observance of rituals, introspection, and yoga. Guru Angad engaged 
                  him in discussion saying that only through living a simple truthful 
                  life as Guru Nanak had lived can God be realized, by remaining pure 
                  amidst impurity. The yogi was eventually won over by the purity and 
                  innocence of Guru Angad and asked the Guru if there was anything that 
                  he could do for him. The humble Guru Angad replied that he only seeked 
                  the learned yogis blessings.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Angad followed 
                    the daily routine that Guru Nanak had. He would wake up early at dawn 
                    to recite Guru Nanak's Japji (morning prayer) as well as sing Asa di 
                    var with his congregation, work during the daytime and then have evening 
                    prayers. Guru Angad also maintained langar where people of all religions 
                    and casts could gather for a free meal. Guru Angad also took a keen 
                    interest in physical fitness, and encouraged his devotees to be involved 
                    in sports after their morning prayers.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After the Mughal 
                      emperor Babur's death he was succeeded by his son Humayun. He was soon 
                      defeated by Sher Shah and on his retreat out of India he stopped at 
                      Khadur to seek the Guru's blessings. When Humayan arrived, Guru Angad 
                      and the congregation were absorbed in singing religious hymns. After 
                      a while Humayan became impatient and angry at being ignored and put 
                      his hand on the hilt of his sword to attack the Guru. Guru Angad was 
                      unmoved by this and said "When you should have used the sword you did 
                      not, rather you ran away from the battlefield like a coward. Here you 
                      show off, threatening to attack unarmed devotees engaged in prayer." 
          Humayan was humbled by this and asked the Guru's forgiveness and blessings. 
          Guru Angad blessed him, and as history was to have it he eventually 
          regained his throne.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Angad was 
                        very fond of children and took a great interest in their education. 
                        He advocated that they should be taught to read and write in their mother 
                        tongue, Punjabi. Although the origins of the Gurmukhi script are unclear, 
                        it is clear that Guru Angad popularized the use of this simplified script 
                        among the Sikhs starting around 1541. Being the successor of Guru Nanak 
                        he also got the first authorized biography of Guru Nanak written in 
                        1544, as well as having a number of copies of Guru Nanak's hymns written 
                        out in the new Gurmukhi script. Guru Angad further expanded the number 
                        of Sikh religious centers.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There lived a very 
                          devout Vaishanavite Hindu named Amar Das. He had regularly made pilgrimages 
                          to the Ganges river for ritual baths for over 20 years. While returning 
                          from his twelfth such pilgrimage he was asked by a monk "Who is your 
                          Guru?" Amar Das felt frustrated as he could not answer this question 
                          having searched his whole life, but still not achieving the peace of 
                          mind that he longed for. One day he heard Bibi Amro the daughter of 
                          Guru Angad, who was recently married to his nephew singing the hymns 
                          of Guru Nanak. Amar Das started to listen to them every day until he 
                          was enchanted by them. Bibi Amro told Amar Das about the mission of 
                          Guru Nanak and promised to introduce him to her father Guru Angad. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When the time finally 
                            came and they met, Guru Angad got up from his seat on his arrival to 
                            embrace Amar Das as he was his relative and also much older than the 
                            Guru. Amar Das instead fell to the Guru's feet out of respect and humility, 
                            forgetting his age and family status. On this day of their meeting, 
                            Guru Angad was eating meat and being a Vaishnav Hindu, Amar Das felt 
                            uncomfortable. Guru Angad told Amar Das that the meats one should avoid 
                            are envy, greed, ego, slander and usurpation of others rights. He told 
                            Amar Das that there is life in everything, whatever is eaten while remembering 
                            God is like nectar itself. Amar Das thus became a devoted disciple of 
                            Guru Angad. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One of the Guru 
                              Angad's wealthy disciple named Gobind decided to build a new township 
                              on the river Beas to honour the Guru. Guru Angad sent Amar Das to supervise 
                              the construction of this new township which came to be known as Goindwal. 
                              When it was completed Guru Angad instructed Amar Das and his family 
                              to move there. Amar Das complied. Every morning he would get up early 
                              in the morning and carry water from the river to the Guru and remain 
                              in his company the entire day before returning to Goindwal in the evenings. 
                              Each year Guru Angad would present a turban as a symbol of honour to 
                              his devoted followers. Such was the devotion of Amar Das that he would 
                              wear one on top of the other, refusing to discard the Guru's gift. People 
                              ridiculed Amar Das for his blind faith, but he was never concerned.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As Guru Angad's 
                                popularity continued to spread among the people, this caused much jealousy 
                                among the Hindu high castes because Guru Angad was gaining popularity 
                                with his preaching about a castless society. They conspired to turn 
                                the people away from the Guru. During a drought year a Hindu recluse 
                                told the villagers "You go to Guru Angad day and night for spiritual 
                                guidance, why can't he get rain for your dying crops?" The recluse forecasted 
                                that there would only be rain when Guru Angad left the village. When 
                                confronted by the desperate farmers Guru Angad replied, "Nature cannot 
                                bend to your will merely by human sacrifice to the gods, or by injuring 
                                someone's heart. But if your rain god is satisfied by my leaving this 
                                village, I shall do so without a moment's hesitation." Leaving the village 
                                Guru Angad was refused shelter in neighboring villages and finally settled 
                                in a forest south of Khadur. When the rains did not come as promised 
                                the villagers grew angry at the Hindu recluse and wanted to kill him. 
                                Amar Das was disappointed with the way that the villagers had treated 
                                Guru Angad. He suggested that instead of killing the recluse the farmers 
                                tie the recluse to a plow and drag him through their fields. The rains 
                                finally came. The villagers now emplored the Guru to return to the village. 
                                When Guru Angad heard to the punishment the Hindu recluse had received 
                                he told Amar Das; "You should have shown endurance, in the face of adversity, 
                                like the earth, steadfastness like a mountain and compassion like a 
                                river. For the wise and the holy, it is unforgivable if they practice 
                                not humility and remain not even-minded in weal or woe." Amar Das asked 
                                for and received forgiveness.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Angad did 
                                  not believe in performing miracles unnecessarily. When Amar Das blessed 
                                  a devotee of the Guru's with a son, Guru Angad warned him, "Do not go 
                                  about disbursing your blessings and curses without due deliberation. 
                                  God is merciful to all men of prayer and good intentions, and one need 
                                  not exhibit one's spiritual prowess by such showmanship."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A village women 
                                    once ridiculed Amar Das for his faithful devotion as being that "homeless 
                                    old man who carries water every day for his Guru daily." When Guru Angad 
                                    heard this he embraced Amar Das and told his congregation; "Amar Das 
                                    is not homeless, he is the shelter of the unsheltered. He is the strength 
                                    of the weak and the emancipation of the slave!" Finding that Amar Das 
                                    was his most worthy disciple and feeling that his end was near Guru 
                                    Angad announced that Amar Das would be his successor. Guru Angad's two 
                                    sons were unhappy with their fathers decision but the Guru told them 
                                    that the honour would go to Amar Das because he was the most worthy 
                                    and humble. Guru Angad bowed before Guru Amar Das placing five copper 
                                    coins and a coconut before him signifying as Guru Nanak had done before 
                                    him. Guru Angad then had Baba Buddha anoint the forehead of Guru Amar 
                                    Das with a saffron mark. Shortly thereafter Guru Angad left this world 
                                    on March 28, 1552.</font>
