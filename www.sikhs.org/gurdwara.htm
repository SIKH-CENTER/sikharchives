        is a Gurdwara?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <img src="images\temple1.jpg" align="right">During the times of the early Gurus, 
        Sikh places of worship were referred to as dharamsalas. They were a place 
        where Sikhs could gather to hear the Guru speak or sing hymns. As the 
        Sikh population continued to grow Guru Hargobind introduced the word Gurdwara, 
        meaning the gateway through which the Guru could be reached. Thereafter 
        all Sikh places of worship came to be known as Gurdwaras. Any place where 
        the Guru Granth Sahib is installed and treated with due respect can be 
        referred to as a Gurdwara, whether it is a room in ones house of a separate 
        building. Three main functions are carried out in all public Gurdwaras. 
        One is Kirtan which is the singing of hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib, 
        another is Katha which is reading of the Guru Granth Sahib and explanations. 
        The third main function which is carried out at every Gurdwara is the 
        Langar, free community kitchen for all visitors of all religions. Along 
        with these main functions Gurdwaras around the world also serve the Sikh 
        community in many other ways including, libraries of Sikh literature, 
        schools to teach children Gurmukhi and the Sikh scriptures and charitable 
        work in the community on behalf of Sikhs. </font>

        <b><font size="3">Gurdwara Protocols</font></b><br>
        When entering the Gurdwara one is expected to remove the shoes and cover 
        ones bare head as signs of respect towards the sovereignty of the Guru 
        Granth Sahib. Hands are washed and in some Gurdwaras there are also feet 
        washes. Approaching the Guru Granth Sahib one is expected to bow down 
        and touch the floor as a sign of further respect towards the Eternal Sikh 
        Guru. Offerings of cash are usually made at this time to help carry the 
        expenses of running the Gurdwara and community work carried out by the 
        Gurdwara. These offerings are voluntary and not compulsory. All people 
        irrespective of their status sit on the floor as a sign of equality as 
        opposed to chairs and the Guru Granth Sahib is always installed on a higher 
        level. One may enter or leave the congregation at any time. Men and women 
        do not generally sit together but on separate sides of the room, both 
        at an equal distance from the Guru Granth Sahib. All people are expected 
        to stand facing the Guru Granth Sahib when the Ardas (common prayer) is 
        read out. Gurdwaras are open to all people of all religions and are generally 
        open 24 hours a day. Some Gurdwaras also provide temporary accommodations 
        for visitors or pilgrims. In the Langar all sit on the floor and food 
        is cooked and served by volunteers, this food is available at all times. 
        Only vegetarian food is served so that no person may be offended and all 
        people of all religions can sit together to share a common meal irrespective 
        of any dietary restrictions. </font>
