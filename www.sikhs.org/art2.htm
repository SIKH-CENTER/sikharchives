        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is generally 
          believed that the Sanskrit word naam, the English word 'name' and the 
          Sikh term Naam as used in Gurbani are synonymous. A deeper study reveals 
          that the word Naam as used in the Sikh scripture is of a somewhat different 
          nature and has a more comprehensive spiritual and divine connotation.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Sanskrit and 
          the English words denote a person or a thing These also mean a designation, 
          reputation, fame, family or clan. Their implication is almost wholly 
          mundane. Whereas Naam has several ramifications. It implies God, the 
          Reality, mystical word or formula to recite or meditate upon (shabad 
          in Gurbani), divine order (hukam) and at places divine teacher (guru) 
          and guru's instructions.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Naam, according 
          to the late Professor Puran Singh, "is the supernaturally natural function 
          of a poetical genius who though in body is at all times of day and night 
          under the influence of the higher soul words of freedom. It is the pure 
          subjectivity of love bursting up under the sole and invisible spirit 
          guidance from below the crusts of earthiness, from under the hard conditions 
          of earthly life."</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Naam, further, 
          stands for the union with the Reality, to be attained by the devout 
          repetition of his name. Naam is the sign, the symbol and song of God. 
          It is the key to enter into the presence and the heart of God. By adoration 
          and singing his praises, saintly hearts glow all the time. Naam brings 
          in peace and tranquillity. It is described as the most potent "detergent" 
          which frees the mind of its filth and afflictions and dyes it to prevent 
          further erosion. The sub-conscious mind or the budhi is further sharpened 
          and molded into instant insight or intuitiveness (sudhi). In this sphere, 
          mystical experience occurs at the mere sway of thoughts. Indeed the 
          universe is sustained and held together by Naam: "Naam ke dhare khand 
          brahmand".</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> God's greatness 
          is beyond human comprehension. But He can be approached through a ladder 
          called Naam which can take us to His height. Naam, therefore, is greater 
          than everything else "sabte ucha jaka nao" and "wada sahib uncha thaon, 
          uche upar ucha nao." In the Sikh scripture God is called by various 
          names such as Ram, Gobind, Mukand, Madhav, Prabhu, Rahim, Karim, Vithal, 
          etc. All such epithet are known as "Karam-Naam" expressing quality and 
          attribute of God. According to Guru Nanak, His eternal name is "Sat", 
          i.e. Truth. He is true and so is His Naam - "Sacha sahib, sach nae." 
          Sat Naam, an attribute given in the Mool Mantra has been His name even 
          before the primal age - "sat naam tera para- purbala."</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In Jap Sahib, Guru 
          Gobind Singh has mentioned several hundred Karam-naams in Arabic, Persian, 
          Sanskrit and Punjabi. Before spelling these out, he has humbly submitted, 
          in his prologue, that since God is beyond comprehension and description, 
          full justice cannot be done to the subject matter. The appropriate word 
          used by him is "Neti, Neti"; this is not all, this is not all as something 
          more is yet to be said about Him.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A devotee absorbed 
          in Naam is oblivious to sorrow and pain; he remains in ever ascending 
          spirit (chardhi- kala), wishes everyone well (sarbat da bhala) and is 
          always ready to protect the weak and saint (sant ubaran dusht uparan) 
          and fight for righteous causes (shubh kiarman te kabhun na taron). His 
          main demand or prayer is for Naam-Dan, the greatest gift and Grace one 
          can aspire for.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In sum, it may 
          be said that Naam is truth, and eternal, comprehensively symbolic of 
          God's attributes, formless, immaculate and absolute. His adoration and 
          meditation is the gateway to God's domain of Grace and bliss. </font>
