            Although there may be some minor differences in the regional customs 
            leading up to the religious ceremony and following the ceremony, there 
            is very little variance in the actual Anand Karaj ceremony in the Gurdwara. 
            The Sikh wedding presented here is a typical example of a traditional 
            Sikh wedding being performed in a North American context. You can either

          A Union of Two Souls </b></font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="wed45.jpg" width="243" height="200" align="right">Anand 
            Karaj is the prescribed form of Sikh marriage, the words literally translate 
            as 'Blissful Union&quot;. The Sikh marriage is a very special ceremony 
            in which two individuals are joined in a equal partnership. It is joyous 
            and festive event which is very family orientated and informal in it's 
            atmosphere. Sikh marriages are usually arranged with families acting 
            as little more than introduction services. The ultimate choice is always 
            left to the girl and boy. In some cases the boy and girl choose each 
            other first and then seek their parents consent and blessing.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rehat Maryada 
            which is The Official Sikh Code of Conduct specifies that no thought 
            should be given to the perspective spouses caste, race or lineage. As 
            long as both the boy and girl profess the Sikh faith and no other faith 
            they may be joined in wedlock by the Anand Karaj ceremony. The Rehat 
            Maryada strictly forbids any sort of dowry arrangement as marriage is 
            not to be viewed as a business transaction. Sikhs are also discouraged 
            from consulting horoscopes or following any other superstitions pertaining 
            to determining a wedding date or time. The Anand Karaj ceremony can 
            be performed in any Gurdwara or home where Sri Guru Granth Sahib has 
            been respectfully installed. The religious ceremony cannot be performed 
            in a hotel or banquet hall. There are no restrictions as to what time 
            the ceremony should start or what time it should end although they are 
            usually performed in the morning with the religious ceremony taking 
            no more than a few hours.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An engagement ceremony 
            called the kurmai is not required but is sometimes performed typically 
            one week before the wedding. It is usually conducted in the Gurdwara 
            or at the home of the boy. It involves Ardas (the common Sikh prayer), 
            Kirtan (hymns from Sri Guru Granth Sahib) and langer (common meal) if 
            performed in the Gurdwara. If performed at home, the brides family visit 
            the house of the groom for a short time. In both cases the groom is 
            usually presented him with a kara, kirpan or Indian sweets. They brides 
            family in turn are presented with a Indian suit and sweets for the girl.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the east marriages 
            are typically a three day affair which begins with the Braat (grooms 
            family and friends) setting off for the girls house in the evening. 
            They are received, entertained and hosted by the girls family and spend 
            the night at her house. The following day the ceremony takes place at 
            the local Gurdwara or at the girls home. Following the religious ceremony 
            festivities, song and dance continue the remainder of the day with the 
            groom and his family departing with the bride the following day. In 
            the west because of the constraints in time and difficulty in coordinating 
            so many people, wedding are usually a one or two day affair. Either 
            the wedding occurs in the morning followed by a dinner and dance banquet 
            in a hall or hotel at night, or the religious ceremony and banquet take 
            place on consecutive days. In rarer cases only the religious ceremony 
            takes place without any banquet.</font></p>
