          <h3>Reading of the Lavans</h3>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The religious ceremony 
        can be conducted by any respected Sikh man or woman. In this case it is 
        being conducted by the local granthi who is in charge of respectfully 
        looking after Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The ceremony officially begins with 
        the officiate after having ascertained that both the bride and groom are 
        Sikh asking the couple to stand up as well as their parents for Ardas. 
        This family Ardas indicated the public consent of the parties involved 
        to this marriage taking place. Every time the bride and groom arise or 
        sit down during the ceremony they will bow down to Sri Guru Granth Sahib 
        out of respect by touching their foreheads to the ground. After Ardas 
        the couple sit down and the officiate then lectures the couple in the 
        significance of marriage, their duties and obligations to each others 
        as equal partners. The couple indicate their agreement to these guidelines 
        and principles by bowing down before Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The father 
        of the bride then places one end of a scarf or sash worn by the groom 
        over his shoulders in his daughters hand signifying that she is now leaving 
        his care to join her husbands. The officiate now reads<a href="wed7a.html" target="_blank"> the 
        Lavan hymn of Guru Ram Das</a> which is composed of four stanzas. The 
        four stanza of the hymn describes the progression of love between a husband 
        and wife which is analogous to that between the soul (bride) and God (the 
        husband). After the conclusion of the recitation of each stanza the groom 
        followed by the bride holding the end of the scarf go around Sri Guru 
        Granth Sahib in a clockwise direction while the ragis sing out the recited 
        Lavan stanza. After each round the couple sit down and listen while the 
        officiate reads the next stanza. The ragis then sing it while the couple 
        completes another walk around Sri Guru Granth Sahib. This process is repeated    four times in total for each stanza of the Lavan after which the couple 
        sit down. During their walk around Sri Guru Granth Sahib often there will 
        be members of the girls family who help her complete her rounds with her 
        husband. This is to signify their support for her as she leaves one family 
  for another.</font></p>
