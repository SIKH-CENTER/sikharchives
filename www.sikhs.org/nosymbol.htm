        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following is 
          a lettter from a father to his son in response to the son's crisis of 
          faith. The son wrote to his father that he did not feel that the five 
          symbols had any significance or relavance in today's modern society 
          and was considering abandoning them. In response the father wrote a 
          letter to his son about the priceless value of the 5K's which is easily 
          forgotten in the modern material world.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Dearest Jaskirat,</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Sat Sri Akal. I 
          must thank you for the deep confidence and the love you have for me. 
          It has always been a joy to read through your letter as they manifest, 
          the sensity of the seeker of truth. I am very happy that you had the 
          courage and conviction to express so openly the things that seem to 
          have been distressing your heart. I somehow felt all this brewing up 
          in you, for the last two years, but had never allowed myself to face 
          it directly, till you wrote the present letter. It is a pleasure to 
          hear it all so plainly stated and I hope, I shall understand and clam 
          your mental anguish.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When you leave 
          the university and face the world it seems to me that what is crucial 
          in life is not to succumb, not to bow your head to various pressures, 
          but to know and feel them as they are, in a gentle spirit, with a great 
          inward strength, so that these pressures will not create conflict in 
          your life. You may question what is given to you or what many of your 
          age assert is being forced on you - but this also means that you must 
          question yourself. You must not merely question, what you call the significance, 
          the need, the value of your own life. It is only with such an integrated 
          total approach that you will understand not only the Kirpan, the Kara, 
          the Kanga, the Kesh and the Kachha, but also appreciate the agonies, 
          the joys, the pain, the pleasure, the vanities and hope of living.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In your letter, 
          the one word which has overpowered you , the one emotion which drives 
          you on, is significance. Over and over again, you want to know what 
          is the significance of the 5 K's? The word certainly is not out of place 
          in our materialistic and individualistic existence. In our efforts to 
          be practical individuals, we want to imbibe only what is of utility 
          and significance, the rest we want to discard. The search for significance 
          in everything is a curse for the present century. It is a form of self-enclosure, 
          self- killing and therefore it breeds the fear of living. The whole 
          world, all your friends, your relations, everyone is struggling for 
          significant and useful things. But what might be significant for you 
          might not be so for your friends.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If you go to a 
          man who has ill-health, he will undoubtedly say, what is significant 
          is good health. If you go to a man who has not had enough wealth in 
          all his life, he will say what is significant in life is money. If you 
          go to a mother she will say the significant thing is to have a son. 
          This is the reason to find an intricate web of explanations, for the 
          significance 5 K's. Every one views it from his own angle of significance.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The first step 
          in your questioning of the 5 K's should be to be free of this yoke of 
          significance. It is this illusionary search for significance, which 
          has made many young ones and their seniors, discard their Kesh, because 
          they see no value in them. It is a pity that we want to reduce Sahib 
          Guru Gobind Singhji, to our own mundane level of thinking and view all 
          his actions in light of practical animal utility. If he was in search 
          of merely objects of practical utility, he could have made a truce with 
          Aurangzeb, when the latter made the offer. Shivaji did so at one stage, 
          because his search was different, his life was different. If the rider 
          of the dark blue steed, wanted the 5 K's to be reflections of practical 
          use values, he could have very well added not only more weapons, but 
          instead of a sword, he would have given us a gun, as guns did exist 
          at that time. A gun would have been more efficient and better suited 
          for self-defense and for war too. But he was not inspired out of a hunt 
          for weapons of self-defense or practical value, as we would make it 
          out, reflecting our own thinking backwards in history. The Guru Sahib 
          was not a novice in the ways of arms, if he only wanted his Sikhs to 
          be armed for war, through these 5 K's he would have rather equipped 
          them the way he did Banda Bahadur at Nanader, when he gave him 5 arrows 
          and a bow. The sword, anyway, in the battlefield would have been useless 
          without a shield. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Kanga, the 
          Kesh, the Kara, the Kirpan and the Kachha were all delicate gifts of 
          love and beauty to the Khalsa from his Master who desired nothing for 
          himself, but everything for the Khalsa. These gifts were from a Guru 
          who grabbed not the gifts of his disciples but instead totally surrendered 
          everything for the cause and love of the Khalsa. A way of total love 
          which was to be unique for the Khalsa; "Jau tau prem khelan ka chao 
          sir dhar tali gali meri ao." (Guru Nanak Ji) "If thou art zealous 
          of playing the game of love, then enter upon my path with thy head on 
          they palm," It was out of such love that these gifts were presented 
          to the Khalsa and not out of any attempt to carve our soldiers. When 
          there is total love there is action, there is sacrifice. Is it not so? 
          The love of Guru for the Khalsa was not the result of mental vibrations, 
          and there was in his life no gap between love and action, as there is 
          between our thinking and action. It is only we who want to be one sided 
          in our love and make claims of loving the Guru in our ideals, in our 
          heart and consequently we reason out that we don't have to express our 
          love for Him in action, in the Desh, but can there be love without total 
          commitment and action? No the total love of Kalgidhar Guru Gobind Singh 
          Ji for the Khalsa becomes apparent in the book titled Surbloh, where, 
          he becomes one with the Khalsa and portrays the Khalsa as his highest 
          love:</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Khalsa is the breath 
          of my body,<br>
          Khalsa is the very soul of my life,<br>
          Khalsa is my real pride and glory,<br>
          Khalsa is my own personal self,<br>
          Khalsa is my life's sustainer,<br>
          Khalsa is my body and breath,<br>
          Khalsa is my creed and karma,<br>
          Khalsa is my conscience keeper,<br>
          Khalsa is my perfect satguru,<br>
          Khalsa is my brave friend,<br>
          Khalsa gives me intellect and wisdom,<br>
          Khalsa is my object of meditation.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The mind that loves 
          the Sikh ways of life is a religious mind because it is the movement 
          of living, of action, of truth, of God and it is only such a mind that 
          can know what is the beauty of gifts that Guru gave to us. The 5 ornaments 
          that we wear are the gifts, from a Guru, whose two younger sons, seven 
          and nine years old faced martyrdom in Sirhind in a manner which is unequaled 
          in the long annals of human history. These two innocent children were 
          walled alive because they refused to bow before the sword of hatred. 
          The Guru's mother merged into the Supreme Being at Sirhind during persecution. 
          The two elder sons of the Guru counted martyrdom fighting in action 
          for us. Guru Sahib himself had been attacked with dagger by two cowardly 
          Pathans at Nanded in Deccan, causing serious injury.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Could such a Benevolent 
          Being whose whole family was destroyed for the total love of the Khalsa, 
          be looking for practical utilities of an animal existence? He was not 
          the person to endow us with gifts of mere practical value, but gifts 
          of love, which knew no questioning, no bartering, no deals and no betraying. 
          His was a total sacrifice and a total love in both thought and action, 
          for the happiness of the Khalsa and these gifts had their pangs of birth 
          in a sea of human blood. It was not out of any practical benefit that 
          the evil genius of the Mughal government announced awards for the hair 
          of Sikhs. It was because they knew that without these gifts, without 
          these embodiments of the Guru's love, the Khalsa would disintegrate.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> All the children 
          of the Khalsa are to always wear a sword, in now way their own private 
          possession or property. The Kirpan is a gift from Guru Gobind Singh 
          Ji to the Khalsa. It is not to be judged and measured as a weapon of 
          war or peace, it is a gift activated by the love of the Guru. Even a 
          whole army of bodyguards of the best police state in the worlds cannot 
          make it redundant. It shall always remain attached to me, the bodyguards 
          cannot make it obsolescent. The sword is the love wherein the Guru resides. 
          A Guru who in his love saw no difference between human beings and fused 
          all of us in one creed of devotion, service and sacrifice, in an age 
          when common men were hanged for even drawing water from the same well, 
          as that of the higher castes. The lower castes were beaten to death 
          if they as such touched the kitchen utensils of a Brahmin.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A Kalal - a wine 
          distiller, once came for the Guru's darshan and stood at a distance, 
          for the caste of the Kalal was considered low in the social hierarchy. 
          When Guru Gobind Singh Ji, saw him he said, "Come in and sit with all 
          of us in the tent." The man quivered, hesitated and said, "How can I, 
          the lowest of the low, sit in the assembly of the gods? Guru Ji, I am 
          a kalal whose mere sight pollutes." On hearing this, Guru Sahib instructed 
          His musicians and bards, to welcome the man with music and songs and 
          coming down from his couch to bless him. He said, "You are not a kalal, 
          but a 'Guru ka-Lal', 'a Ruby of the Guru.' Who has such love for us? 
          The sword which we have, is an ornament for all of us, the rich and 
          the poor, you , me and the whole humanity. To wear a sword which was 
          once a privilege of the few high born, under the dictates of the Mughal 
          aristocracy, with the Guru's blessings became a gift which any one could 
          carry, without fear of being prosecuted, because now it was in love 
          from the Guru to the Khalsa "dan dio iniko bhalo avaranko dan na lagat 
          niko." (Guru Gobind Singh). "To bestow gifts on them alone is worthy, 
          to make gifts to others is not kind".</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When his hands 
          stroked our hair, washed them, combed them, dressed, knotted them and 
          placed in them the invaluable Kanga, how can we, his sons and daughters, 
          bear our hair to be cut? The Guru Sahib saturated our hair with Amrita. 
          He left the imprint of his blessings and joy in our hair. Our hair are 
          like the untouched pearl in the deep oceans not yet disfigured by the 
          fortune hunters. You say it is inconvenient, frustrating, impractical 
          to grow our hair long. But more frustrating is an existence of no inspiration, 
          no effort. Our superficial hollow life is no way less discouraging. 
          The day to day fragmentary living, the everyday struggle for food, the 
          daily pain, suffering, distress, torments and headaches are in no way 
          less discomforting. But inspite of all this do we cease to exist? No, 
          on the contrary we strive all the more and struggle for pleasure, gratification, 
          comforts and joy. If we can reconcile ourselves to such an empty living, 
          can we not grow our hair long which is so inspiring, creative, fulfilling 
          and above all a gift from our Guru, a gift whose rejection would be 
          a rejection of our existence, the negation of the very purpose of our 
          life.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the West, the 
          children love so much the gifts made to them on Christmas by the mythical 
          Santa Claus, they hungrily search their stockings for the gifts placed 
          in them by their parents and after receiving their gifts feel so elated 
          and we so ungrateful, that we fight, throw away, kick at the gifts of 
          our loving father, who kept nothing for the future of his House and 
          gifted to us everything he possessed - physical, spiritual and material.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The elegant kachha 
          we wear every day is the very same as the one worn by Guru Ji himself, 
          by his disciples and by his lovers. Clad in it, we are one with him. 
          The exotic wooden comb he tucked in our hair, also combed, danced and 
          swung in his hair. The kanga, is the new born baby, playing in the lap 
          of the loving mother, whom we so brutally want to strangle. It was these 
          very same presents, for which tens and thousands of my brothers laid 
          down their lives. Have you watched the tears in eyes of a sheep while 
          she is being sheared? And many of us so happy without our hair. we for 
          sure have traveled a long way from the animal.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The kara has to 
          be received by us as a present from our Guru, which is not comparable 
          to our wealth, our intelligence, our achievements. It comes to us as 
          a manifestation of His love and benefaction. It is strange behavior 
          indeed that we constantly argue about it. He put on our wrist the kara, 
          from that day it was for ever ours, no one could separate it from a 
          Sikh, and we still advance reasons for it. He loved me. He made me his 
          own. He elevated me from the darkness of ignorance to light of spiritual 
          consciousness. Can I not even make his gifts my own? We his children, 
          have to wear these gifts, carved out of infinite love. One with these 
          gifts, we blossom, separated from them we wither. The decay in the Khalsa 
          is apparent.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Each one of us 
          wears the hair and beard of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, exactly as he wore 
          them. We are created in his majestic image. Jab lag rahe khalsa niara, 
          tab lag tej dio mai sara, jab eh gahain bipran ki ritl, mai na karo 
          in ki partit" (Guru Gobind Singh) "So long as the Khalsa retains identity, 
          I will bestow to them full glory; but the moment they adopt Brahmanical 
          ways, I will not protect them." Our significance is in Him, and not 
          anywhere without Him and his gifts. In these gifts we are reminded of 
          his Omniscence, Omnipotence and Omnipresence.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jaskirat, do not 
          make our presents into dead symbols, they are the gorgeous ornaments 
          of the living. We are the "Wedded Women" of the God. They are the wedding 
          gifts from our Bridegroom. He gave all of them to use and they are God-sent 
          - imperishable, indispensable and indestructible, superstitious and 
          fatalistic. But the waves of pure love always have their own logic, 
          rationality and fatalism. I love the Guru's irrationality - if you want 
          to call it so "sev kari inhiman bhavat, aur ki sev suhat na jiko." (Guru 
          Gobind Singh) "To serve them pleaseth me, service of any other is not 
          dear to me." I don't have the courage to reject such devotion.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Does a would-be-wife 
          question the intrinsic value of the engagement ring, she is gifted by 
          her husband? No, never, even if it is made of copper or a shell. Today, 
          you want to discard these gifts, because gold has more value. Yes, iron 
          was poor in worldly goods. A wealthy merchant, Hargopal once grudgingly 
          brought for Guru Gobind Singh, two gold bracelets studded with precious 
          jewels, not because he loved the Guru, but because he felt that in doing 
          so, he would please his own father, who was a devotee of the Guru Sahib. 
          One of these expensive bracelets accidentally fell into the Jamna river 
          from the hands of Guru Ji. At this, Hargopal was very displeased and 
          when his attempt to recover the bracelet proved futile, he asked Guruji 
          to point at the exact place where he had dropped the bracelet, so that 
          he could take it out. To indicate the place in the river, where the 
          bracelet had fallen, Guru Gobind Singh Ji took out the other gold bracelet 
          from his wrist and throwing it in the river he told Hargopal, "It is 
          there."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> You want to question 
          the utility of the iron bangle of the Guru, but not of the gold bangle 
          which is so much in vogue at Sikh engagement ceremonies today. You are 
          ready to discard the Guru's bangle for the yellow metal. But do not 
          forget your first marriage, out of whose womb you stand today, aspiring 
          for these worldly gifts. The body can be made the basis of either animal 
          inconsistency or a divine temple. The choice is yours, the solitude 
          of separation is yours. These gifts are not to be stored in the darkness 
          of the cellars; think deep into them, if you want to live in spiritual 
          grandeur.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The head of a Sikh, 
          the kesh of a Sikh, having been once offered and accepted, become forever 
          of the Guru. It is an unceasing trust with Him. It is therefore imperative 
          for a Sikh to carry his head high and not to bow it before a mortal 
          barber. It shall only bend and bow before the Guru. Once a new musket 
          was brought as a present for Guru Gobind Singh Ji. He said, to test 
          the love of his disciples, that he wanted to try the aim of the musket 
          on someones forehead. He looked around and asked if any of his Singhs 
          would offer himself for the trial. Quick come up-scores of unflinching 
          Sikhs, each pushing the other one away, regarding it as a boon to meet 
          death at the Guru's hand, and we today so uninspired, sleeping beauties 
          that except for empty words, have no deeds worthy of our name.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Everyday we recite 
          in our prayer, "Nanak das sada Kurbani." "Nanak thy servant is ever 
          a sacrifice to Thee." But what is that we sacrifice everyday? Guru Gobind 
          Singh was the purest sacrifice. We may never reach his height, but some 
          sacrifice we can do. But instead we sacrifice our 5 K's. Shocking is 
          our spirit of sacrifice. If the Khalsa today is hollow, it is because 
          we forget our tradition of sacrifices, it is because we forget the love 
          of a sacrificer, it is because we regard his gifts as mere symbols. 
          "Balhari gur apne diohadi sadvar." (Guru Nanak) "I am a sacrifice to 
          my Guru Hundred times a day." Are we the worthy inheritors of this heritage? 
          After drawing on his blood, now we want to stab him in the back!</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jaskirat, one kilometer, 
          from the Lahore railway station stands a gurdwara, sacred to the Sikhs 
          in the loving memory of Bhai Taru Singh Ji. It bears the name of Shahid 
          Ganj, the Abode of Martyrs. Bhai Sahib was resident of village Poola 
          where he had a small piece of land. The wheat and the maize that he 
          produced and the humble mud hut he had, he happily shared with all the 
          weary travelers who passed through the village and needed a shelter 
          to sleep for the night. He belonged wholly to the Guru's hymns and early 
          in the morning under the stars, while on the plough, with a white turban 
          and a blue chola, a poor toiler of the earth, he recited the Japji. 
          The Japji which has in it the inimitable cosmicness of life in nature. 
          The villagers loved Taru Singh for his fellow feeling harmlessness and 
          spiritual purity.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But being a Sikh, 
          Taru Singh was not destined to live any longer, his life of love, free 
          from the hatred of caste colour and religion. The authoritarian Mughal 
          government of medieval India was not willing to appreciate the way of 
          life of the Sikhs, which drew no dividing line between man and man, 
          between Hindus and Muslims, between Brahims and Sardars "manas ki jat 
          sab ik hi pahchanho". (Guru Gobind Singh) "All men are the same", it 
          was a creed which cut at the very rood of Mughal establishment based 
          on human distinctions. To extinguish this smithy of love, the government 
          offered to its subjects numerous monetary awards for the heads of the 
          Sikhs and they were declared outlaws. The greed for gold tempted Bhagat 
          Nirangi to lodge a complaint against Bhai Taru Singh, with the Subedar 
          (governor) of Lahore, stating that he gave shelter, to dacoits, the 
          Sikhs, and the property of Muslim and Hindu subjects of His Gracious 
          Majority, was unsafe. Such a complaint was unnecessary for the very 
          living of a Sikh was a reason enough for the state armed forces, to 
          go and imprison Bhai Taru Singh, who was bound in ropes and brought 
          before the Subedar.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When the Subedar, 
          saw this young man of 23, he was overwhelmed and shaken by his presence. 
          He felt himself transposed to another world. There was a radiance around 
          him which made the Nawab exclaim: "Khaunda! What a divine Noor (glory) 
          on his face. I pray that he should be a Musalman!" Addressing Taru Singh, 
          the Nawab said, "O, graceful Sikh, I feel sorry for you and I wish to 
          give you a new lease of life." Taru Singh with tears in his eyes, responded: 
          "Reward me with a new lease of life? Why stain me with such dishonour 
          while my brothers and sisters are being martyred here before me, every 
          day, every hour? The Subedar said, you presence is resplended with a 
          heavenly light. Somehow my heart does not permit me to have you killed, 
          but you must cut and present me your tress-knot."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Taru Singh replied, 
          "The Sikh and his hair are one. I will be pleased to give you more than 
          you ask me, my head with my tress-knot". These hair are the eternal 
          gift of love, of immeasurable beauty to the Khalsa by our Guru, they 
          cannot be separated from a Singh's head, without separating his head. 
          The one who just looks at them can never understand them. It is like 
          looking into a mirror, but you are not one with the mirror. The observer 
          is only capable of experiencing, he is never mirror, the experience, 
          the state itself. These hair are the fountain of joy, the spring of 
          life for us.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Subedar still 
          confident of bribing him then said: "Taru Singh, you are too young. 
          You have not yet experienced the beauty and joy of life. I will make 
          arrangements for your marriage with a woman of your choice. You will 
          be awarded with high mansob (office) in the Mughal army. You will be 
          endowed with a hereditary jagir, I promise you all sorts of luxuries 
          but you must part with your way of life and accept the Muslim religion."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A Guru ka Sikh 
          can never be tamed and now his tears mingling with a smile of joy, Taru 
          Singh replied, "Having been sent by Him they come (into the world) and 
          recalled by Him they go back", said Guru Nanak. "It is the right and 
          privilege of the brave to die", says He, "For a Sikh, life has beginning 
          and no end - it is both death and life. Neither my life nor my hair 
          are for bargaining in your court which views beauty, life and religion 
          in weights of gold. The value and beauty of our hair cannot be measured 
          in terms of luxuries and jagirs. Your thinking is materialistic and 
          is therefore negligible, but an integrated living is always spiritual".</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Subedar could 
          no longer bear this song of truth as he cried out, "Stop him, for he 
          disturbs the law and order of our province. Kill him, for he disturbs 
          the law and order of our province. Kill him at once, but cut his hair 
          before." The Mughal soldiers caught hold of Bhai Sahib's head and chin, 
          but the barber found it impossible to bring his hand near his head. 
          With a stroke of his head he would push back his captors and make them 
          whirl on the ground. A cobbler was then sent for, to try his skill with 
          his tools and scrape off Taru Singh's hair, but his attempt too proved 
          abortive. At last the help of a carpenter was asked for the foul deed 
          with a stroke of his age, he cut off Bhai Taru Singh's head (1743 A.D.) 
          but failed to cut his tress-knot.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Thakur Rabindranath 
          Tagore, a great mystic poet of Bengal has beautifully sung of this episode:<br>
          Parathona Atit Dan - "More than asked For"</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For a Sikh to cut 
          his tress-knots<br>
          Amounts to discarding his dharma<br>
          The Pathans brought, bound hand and foot, the Sikh prisoners,<br>
          Shahid Ganj earth turned red with their blood The Nawab addressing Taru 
          Singh,<br>
          said unto him:<br>
          'I wish to spare thy life'.<br>
          Taru Singh retorted: Spare my life!<br>
          Why thou dishonors me?<br>
          Said the Nawab: Thou art bravest of the brave?<br>
          'I don't wish to wreak my anger on thee,<br>
          Taru Singh replied: 'O Nawab they request with my heart I comply and 
          liberally grant thee more than what thou begest of me:<br>
          'My head with my tress-knot',</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jaskirat, if Bhai 
          Taru Singh had looked for practical utility, significance and relevance 
          wouldn't he have exchanged his hair for a Jagir, for beautiful women 
          and the power he was offered? But all these he regarded as worthless 
          when he weighted them with his way of life. If the hair were mere symbols 
          for him, would he have staked his life for them. The term symbols can 
          never express the depth of these gifts. You will never find even a most 
          dutiful policeman leaping to death, to uphold a short circuited burning 
          traffic light signal, because it is a sheer symbol for the cars and 
          lorries on the road, it is an external factor to his life. But our 5K's 
          are much deeper and profound than symbols and this is the reason we 
          find not only Bhai Taru Singh, but a whole galaxy of martyrs in our 
          History - Bhai Mati Das, Dyal Chand, Bhai Mani Singh and Subeg Singh 
          - all playing with their lives, which appears to us so irrational and 
          fatalistic.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Son, you merely 
          read about the 5 symbols in isolation, meditate on them as links with 
          lives of your ancestors, it is only then that their meaning will be 
          apparent to you. In themselves the 5K's might appear to be mere symbols, 
          show windows but it is only when they are knit with our lives, woven 
          in our existence, painted with our daily sorrow and joys that their 
          value, justification and significance emerges. They are inseparable 
          from our life and if you perceive of them as separate, it is not surprising 
          that they appear to be frivolous, justified and a burden of the past. 
          If you are wounded and in agony it is because you want to separate, 
          from yourself, what is vital for existence.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Unfortunately, 
          you visualized only a part in segregation from the whole. You are looking 
          out of a small window set in the wall, from which the outside may appear 
          to be attractive and convincing for sometimes, but it does not allow 
          you to view the beauty of life. Without linking these ornaments of love, 
          with your daily existence, you can never have perception of the whole, 
          therefore you will always be sad and when the end comes, you will still 
          be grouping in the darkness of your cell; you will have had nothing 
          but hallucinations and a lot of empty words. But if you fall in love, 
          now with these unique gifts, if you love your Kesh not, the Kirpan you 
          wear, then son as you grow up, you will not remain in your dungeon with 
          its dark windows, but will leave it and love the whole way of life. 
          If you don't constantly have a passionate love for those presents of 
          the Guru, then you are like a flower without fragrance, withered and 
          lying in the dust, being crushed and kicked by every pedestrian. Only 
          he can have love for God, who abandons his ego, forgets himself completely 
          and thereby brings the state of creative consciousness. The "me" and 
          "I" from its very birth is constantly building a barrier of knowledge 
          around itself, around its actions and ultimately leads to isolation 
          and despair. A life of the dead.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Knowledge is only 
          a minor part of life, not the totality and when it thus assumes all 
          consuming significance, as it is now then your life becomes artificial, 
          an empty cut, from which man tries to escape, through superficial escapes 
          with disastrous results. Knowledge is like a kerosene lame on a dark 
          night, but it can illuminate only so long as it has fuel. Life is much 
          vaster and deeper, it cannot be lived with the aid of an extinguishable 
          lamp. Knowledge is essential to everyday existence, as money is to but 
          your food, but it cannon grasp the reality of love, of God, of living. 
          Love is not to be hooky in the net of intelligence; if you use knowledge 
          to grasp love, it will die as one fish dies out of water. Knowledge 
          must be left behind for love to be. Burdened with mechanical learning 
          you will never understand what is beauty, what is measurable. The light 
          of knowledge is a covering under which lies a realm of truth, which 
          knowledge cannot penetrate. The worship of knowledge is a ritualistic 
          pilgrimage, which can never dissolve the contradictions and miseries 
          of life. Mere knowledge, however earnestly learnt and cleverly assembled, 
          will never resolve the meaning of the 5 K's to assume that it will, 
          is to invite frustration and misery. You may know all about the working 
          of the earth and the functioning of the skies and still not be free 
          from sorrow, envy and pain.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To know these gifts, 
          to value truth, to be one with God, you must have claims, to beliefs, 
          no speculations "Sochia soch na hovai je sochai lakhvar" (Guru Nanak) 
          "Mortal cannot comprehend Him by thought." If you have gathered the 
          knowledge of living, the knowledge itself becomes more important, not 
          your living. If you want to understand these gifts, everything will 
          come right. Live in them and there is understanding, "hukmai andarsabh 
          ko bahr hnkam na koe. Nanak hukmi je bujhai ta haumai kahe na koe." 
          (Guru Nanak) "Nothing at all outside His will, abiding O Nanak, he who 
          is aware of the supermen will never in his selfhood utterest the boast: 
          It is I". The Supreme Will was to live in the glory of these embellishments 
          of our land so shall it be.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> These gifts of 
          ours are not symbols of a religion, or compulsory rites of a religion. 
          The Sikh way of life is not to live on any set of rituals, formalism, 
          talismans, penances, austerities, pilgrimages or symbols. The Sikhs 
          were rebels against all this and more. The gurbani abounds, in hymns 
          against ritualism and symbols. Guru Nanak Ji said in on of his compositions 
          "Yoga lies not in wearing patched garments, nor in carrying a staff, 
          nor in smearing one's body with ashes, nor does it lie in wearing earrings, 
          not in cutting one's hear, not in playing on a singi." (Suhi I). Could 
          anyone have said something more against the irrelevance of symbols. 
          How strongly he felt against empty symbols may be gauged from these 
          lines, "With tikka (the sacred mark) on their foreheads and dhoti wrapped 
          around their loins and legs, they look pious, but in fact they are the 
          world's butchers carrying daggers in their hands." (Asa-da-var) The 
          shallowness of ritualism and symbols was exposed thoroughly by Guru 
          Gobind Singh Ji, the Akal Ustati:</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Some worship but 
          stocks and stones, while others suspend the lingum from their necks.<br>
          Some look for the God in the East, other in the West,<br>
          Some worship but idols, some are unwise enough to worship the dead;<br>
          All these are involved in a false show, and they find the Mystery, that 
          is God.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After the victory 
          of the battle of Bhangani, Guru Gobind Singh Ji blessed Pir Budhu Shah, 
          with no treasures and no elephants, for his service, as was the custom 
          of that time, but a Kirpan and comb with some broken hair of his. These 
          gifts are still preserved as sacred relics in the former princely state 
          of Nabha. This very jewelry, he presented to all of us, inspite of the 
          fact that our lives were not wrought in the furnace of sacrifice - a 
          jeweler which no craftsman, no intellectual, no jeweler is capable of 
          imitating. These gifts of ours are the constellation of superconsiousness, 
          the very essence of breath of God in us, of which our tress-knots are 
          the spiritual crown of humanity.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jaskirat, ask not 
          from me the significance, the value, the power of our tress-knots, for 
          I am incapable of describing it. In the meadows, dales and mountains 
          of our tress-knots, the bliss of perennial joy flows, in the beautitude 
          of our tress-knots, the flowers are fired. In our mystical tress-knots, 
          the insipid mankind is inspired in the holiness of our pristine pure 
          tress-knots, the sun chariot rides high in eternity; in the infinity 
          of our tress-knots; the melting snow caps of the mountain peaks, wash 
          away all sorrows; in our august tress-knots, the frenzied rain torrents 
          pour; in the creativity of our transcendental tress-knots, his nakedness 
          is robed anew in the effulgence of these gifts.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Live in the eternal 
          joy of your tress-knots and you will know what it is, to be. Men collect 
          the ashes of the departed soul and pray for him in the church and the 
          temples and you want to discard, this living soul, this living temple! 
          People build monuments for the dead, you want to uproot the living monument 
          the Guru gave to you. If you want it to disintegrate you may, but you 
          shall forever be buried under it.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The love shall 
          still come your way because you are one of the descendants of the ancient 
          lore, you will still flex your muscles when the song is of your forefathers, 
          but you would have converted the garden of the living into the weeds 
          of the dead. The gardener will shed his tears but no more will you grow. 
          Soon, even his tears will dry as he tends new gardens. A time comes 
          when no one knows, of the long ruined monument. It passes back into 
          the womb of agony and is possessed by the serpents, jackals and chameleons.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jaskirat our 5 
          K's are beyond the realm of rituals and symbols, they are the timeless 
          ones. Can you and me enclose with our intellects what is not measurable? 
          Can you and me enclose with out intellects what is not time? Can our 
          constant hatred, anger, ugliness, lead us to the unknown? Do we have 
          an instrument to gauge what has not beginning and no end? Can the truth 
          of these gifts be trapped in the cage of logic? What we may capture 
          by our mechanical knowledge and logic, is superficial, never the cosmicness 
          of these presents. Many of us spiritedly respond to tranquilizers but 
          living in love, needs no tranquilizers.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The beautiful, 
          the loved can never be dissected and summed up. For these gifts, we 
          can reach no conclusions, no morals and no judgments because they are 
          not symbols, but pieces of art. What would the cuckoo's song mean to 
          you, if you want to take down its notation and analyze them? What would 
          your mother be for you if you want to know her by analysis? Only a biological 
          skeleton for procreation. You have so much trapped yourself in a net 
          of words, of speculations that the feeling itself, which is the only 
          thing that is deep and vital in us in lost. The significance or the 
          insignificance of these gifts is not important. The highest art in life 
          is to be beautiful. And these gifts are the force that creates the beautiful, 
          the artistic in us. It is one in a million, who has the beauty of these 
          ornaments.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The kesh, the kachha, 
          the kara, the kanga and the kirpan are the gifts, chiseled out for the 
          Khalsa, by the divine artist. These are gifts, endowed to us forever 
          by the Divine Bridegroom, on the day of our marriage to him, on Baisakhi, 
          in 1699 at Anandpur Sahib (The City of Bliss). They are true embodiments 
          of art and anyone looking at them, can have his bosom full of meanings, 
          ecstasy, inspiration, love, joy and what more can we wish? In them we 
          have the treasure, mines, in them is the beauty and we are so ignorant 
          of it. We the cosmic brides will carry his gifts of love, in honour, 
          purity and splendour glory and our love will blossom in all climates, 
          in all times and in all continents.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> May the blessing 
          of Waheguru Ji be with you forever.</font>
