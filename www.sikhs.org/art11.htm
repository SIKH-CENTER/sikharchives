        <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In the Golden Age 
        of Satjug, everyone spoke the Truth. In each and every home, devotional 
        worship was performed by the people, according to the Guru's Teachings. 
        In that Golden Age, religion had four feet. How rare are those people 
        who, as Gurmukh, contemplate this and understand. In all four ages, the 
        Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glory and greatness. One who holds tight 
        to the Naam is liberated; without the Guru, no one obtains the Naam. In 
        the Silver Age of Traytai, one leg was removed. Hypocrisy became prevalent, 
        and people thought that the Lord was far away. The Gurmukhs still understood 
        and realized; the Naam abided deep within them, and they were at peace. 
        In the Brass Age of Dwaapur, duality and double-mindedness arose. Deluded 
        by doubt, they knew duality. In this Brass Age, religion was left with 
        only two feet. Those who became Gurmukh implanted the Naam deep within. 
        In the Iron Age of Kaljug, religion was left with only one power. It walks 
        on just one foot; love and emotional attachment to Maya have increased. 
        Love and emotional attachment to Maya bring total darkness. If someone 
        meets the True Guru, he is saved, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord. 
        Throughout the ages, there is only the One True Lord. Among all, is the 
        True Lord; there is no other at all. Praising the True Lord, true peace 
        is attained. How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, chant the Naam. Throughout 
        all the ages, the Naam is the ultimate, the most sublime. How rare are 
        those, who as Gurmukh, understand this. One who meditates on the Lord's 
        Name is a humble devotee. O Nanak, in each and every age, the Naam is 
        glory and greatness." (Guru Amar Das, pg. 880) </font></i> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here we are in 
          the age of Kaljug, the age of darkness. Where do Sikhs find themselves 
          as a religion and a people and where are they going as the next millennia 
          approaches? Today Sikhs face a host of problems and issues, but instead 
          of focusing on those problems as has been done countless times before, 
          this paper will instead try to highlight some of the key issues and 
          challenges that Sikhs will have to deal with in the very near future. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At this time the 
          Sikh religion is firmly in control of the older generations from Punjab 
          and it's religious institutions around the world are run as virtual 
          extensions of Punjab and the Punjabi mentality. Many issues are not 
          dealt with because they never had to be dealt with in the past and it 
          is always easier to maintain the status quo rather than try to find 
          new answers. What will happened ten or fifteen years down the road when 
          the Sikh religious institutions around the world are run by a new generation 
          which were not born in Punjab or have very little contact with Punjab? 
          A lot of these potential problems that Sikhs will be faced are still 
          in their infancy right now. Either Sikhs can choose to ignore them today 
          as they have been to a large extent, which means that they will become 
          major crises for the religion tomorrow, or they can start planning and 
          trying to develop solutions. We are approaching a major crossroads as 
          a religion which will either see Sikhism become truly a major world 
          religion as the Gurus wished or we will see it wither away and become 
          extinct over time. The choice is clearly in our own hands. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Karl Marx the father 
          of communism once said, "If God manifests in the research institute, 
          then only shall I believe in His existence." There is an increasing 
          belief in the world today that the ideas of "faith" are blind and that 
          "faith" is equivalent to " being blind". The question which should be 
          asked is that does society not also place blind faith in science? Who 
          has seen or touched an electron? Scientists have never actually seen 
          a black hole in outer space, but only theorize its existence based on 
          the bending of light waves of neighboring stars and galaxies. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Can science convey 
          the beauty of a sunset or the smell of a rose or the value of a person? 
          No it can not. All that science can do is to quantify these by breaking 
          them down into various analysis that do not necessarily add up to describe 
          the substance of the whole. A human being is much more than water, minerals 
          and trace elements that make up our bodies. The smell of a rose is much 
          more than the quantity and type of molecules that it releases into the 
          air. God and religion can not be understood by blindly applying the 
          scientific method. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"God is not 
          found by intellectual devices; He is unknowable and unseen." (Guru Arjan 
          Dev, pg.1098) </i> </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"He is not obtained 
          by intellectual recitation or great cleverness; only by love does the 
          mind obtain Him." (Guru Nanak Dev, pg. 436) </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As science pushes 
          back the frontiers of the known universe can science and logic be used 
          to explain the entire universe? </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"So many worlds 
          beyond this world&oacute;so very many! What power holds them, and supports 
          their weight? The names and the colors of the assorted species of beings 
          were all inscribed by the Ever-flowing Pen of God. Who knows how to 
          write this account? Just imagine what a huge scroll it would take! What 
          power! What fascinating beauty! And what gifts! Who can know their extent? 
          You created the vast expanse of the Universe with One Word! Hundreds 
          of thousands of rivers began to flow. How can Your Creative Potency 
          be described?" (Guru Nanak Dev, Japji Sahib) </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When Guru Arjan 
          and his scribe Bhai Gurdas finished compiling Sri Guru Granth Sahib 
          in 1604, the technology of the time was limited to paper. Now 400 years 
          later technology has advanced at a blinding pace and it's advancement 
          is continuing at an exponential rate. How Sikhs deal with these advancements 
          will be critical to their survival. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> How can technology 
          affect something as timeless and immortal as Sri Guru Granth Sahib? 
          Well the definition of what exactly is our Guru is causing controversy 
          in itself. Do we as Sikhs worship the teachings of our Gurus as our 
          living Shabad Guru today, or do we worship the technology of that message, 
          ie. the physical "book"? Sikhs are very quick to point out to the unfamiliar 
          outsider that may visit a Gurdwara that 'no we are not idol worshippers' 
          because of the way we treat Sri Guru Granth Sahib in the Gurdwara. The 
          standard Sikh response is that we worship and show utmost respect to 
          the wisdom of our Gurus enshrined in the book and are not worshipping 
          the book itself. If we truly worship the message and not the messenger 
          than why is there so much confusion starting to develop over what exactly 
          is the Shabad Guru? Some say that the Guru can only be in book form 
          in it's original Gurmukhi form. That the Guru can only be in one volume, 
          not two or 8 volumes. How do we deal with translations of Sri Guru Granth 
          Sahib into different languages? How do we deal with a CD containing 
          the original Gurmukhi and a English translation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib? 
          How do we deal with Gurmukhi and English versions of Sri Guru Granth 
          Sahib being transmitted across the Internet? </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> What is our Guru? 
          A good starting place to start in searching for answers can be found 
          at the very end of Sri Guru Granth Sahib itself in Mundaavanee. Here 
          Guru Arjan Ji writes: </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Upon this Plate, 
          three things have been placed: <u>Truth</u>, <u>Contentment</u> and 
          <u>Contemplation</u>. The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of 
          our Lord and Master, has been placed upon it as well; it is the Support 
          of all. One who eats it and enjoys it shall be saved. This thing can 
          never be forsaken; keep this always and forever in your mind. The dark 
          world-ocean is crossed over, by grasping the Feet of the Lord; O Nanak, 
          it is all the extension of God." (Guru Arjan Dev, Mundaavanee, pg. 1429) 
          </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Are <i>Truth, Contentment 
          and Contemplation</i> not contained in two volumes, or on a Gurbani 
          CD or a translation in another language or possibly transmitted across

          wisdom</u> and <u>meditation</u> are contained within it. The Gurmukhs 
          chant it, and the Gurmukhs realize it. Intuitively aware, they meditate 
          on it." (Guru Angad Dev, pg. 1243) </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Are <i>spiritual 
          wisdom, meditation</i> and <i>the essence of reality</i> not contained

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Gurus undertook 
          missions to spread their teachings in the native languages of the people 
          they came into contact with. They never believed in the exclusivity 
          of their teachings or in a intellectual elite with a 'sacred' language.

          of the gods." (Guru Gobind Singh, Akal Ustati) </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Amar Das, 
          the Guru which helped to turn Sikhism into an organized institutional 
          religion by sending Sikh missionaries to the various parts of Asia wrote: 
          </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Enshrine the 
          Lord's Name within your heart. The Word of the Guru's Bani prevails 
          throughout the world; through this Bani, the Lord's Name is obtained." 
          (Guru Amar Das, pg. 1066) </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> How could the Guru's 
          Bani prevail throughout the world unless Guru Amar Das meant that the 
          message of the house of Nanak as found in Sri Guru Granth Sahib transcends 
          all cultural and linguistic boundaries. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Unlike the Semitic 
          religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), Sikhism does not believe in 
          the idea of a "chosen people", yet we continue to propagate our religion 
          for the most part solely through inheritance. How can Sikhism ever become 
          a major world religion if we stick to this "ghetto mentality"? The Gurus 
          had a true world view of humanity as opposed to a "Punjabi-centric" 
          view that most Sikhs hold today. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"The True Guru, 
          the Primal Being, is kind and compassionate; all are alike to Him. He 
          looks upon all impartially; with pure faith in the mind, He is obtained." 
          (Guru Ram Das, pg. 300) </i> </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"The same eyes 
          have they, the same ears, the same body, the same habits, a get-together 
          of earth, air, water and fire. Allah is no different from Abhekha, the 
          Puranas no different from the Quran. All men are made alike. They appear 
          no different to me." (Guru Gobind Singh, Kabitas 71-90, Akal Ustati) 
          </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Only by returning 
          to our missionary roots and realizing and accepting that Sikhism must 
          be propagated based on it's virtues and principals as opposed to inheritance 
          can we break free of this "ghetto mentality" which is seriously inhibiting 
          the growth and global propagation of Sikhism. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Like most world 
          religions today, we can see a divergence taking place. On one side you 
          have people who have totally abandoned Sikhism or treat religion like 
          a part time hobby. On the other end of the spectrum you have the development 
          of hard-core fundamentalists with their "exclusive club" mentality, 
          intolerance and attempts at distorting our religious heritage and history 
          to accommodate their own views. Which is the more dangerous and destructive 
          element? Narrow mindedness and intolerance is just as bad or worse than 
          having no religion at all. Religion is not about showing others how 
          devoted and religious a person one is, but actually living by the principles 
          and teachings of the Gurus for ones own sake rather than for the sake 
          of others. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Whosoever assumes 
          a religious garb pleases not God even a bit. O ye men, understand this 
          clearly in your minds, that God is attained not through showmanship. 
          They who practice deceit, attain not Deliverance in the Hereafter. They 
          do so only to accomplish the affairs of the world and even the kings 
          worship them for their appearance! But through showmanship, God is attained 
          not, howsoever one searches. He who subdues his mind alone recognizes 
          the Transcendent God." (Guru Gobind Singh, Chaupai 53-55, Chapter 6, 
          Vachitra Natak) </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 5K's and physical 
          distinctiveness of the Khalsa are a cornerstone of Sikhism and this 
          will never change, nor should it. What has changed though is the shift 
          in emphasis to the ritualization of our religion as opposed to understanding 
          and applying the spiritual teachings of the Gurus. Sri Guru Granth Sahib 
          has become something only accessible and understood by an elite minority. 
          The majority are happy just to go to the Gurdwara and listen to the 
          hymns and show respect to the "book" without understanding what they 
          hear or read. The shift in emphasis has occurred over time because of 
          a lack of religious education, both on the institutional level as well 
          as the family level. Unless this disturbing trend is reversed Sikhism 
          will become nothing but a religion of empty rituals. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Kabeer, the 
          paper is the prison, and the ink of rituals are the bars on the windows." 
          (Bhagat Kabir, pg. 1371) </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> With a shift in 
          emphasis to rituals, religion itself becomes a marketable commodity. 
          We can see this in it's advanced stages in the Christian religion, but 
          Sikhism is starting to follow this same trend. The religious experience 
          itself is being exploited as a financial commodity and a money making 
          scheme. This is clearly unacceptable according to the Sikh doctrine.

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To help clearly 
          define what a Sikh is and how a Sikh individual should lead their daily 
          life in accordance with the spiritual principles of Sri Guru Granth 
          Sahib, the Rehat Maryada was developed. A tremendous amount of work 
          and effort went into creating the Rehat Maryada and it has been ratified 
          and accepted by the entire Sikh people as their one and only Official 
          Sikh Code of Conduct and Conventions. It must be realized that unlike 
          Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the Rehat Maryada is a dynamic document of Panthic 
          consensus. As such it must be fully representative of the changes in 
          society and take into account the Sikh Diaspora. The current Rehat Maryada 
          contains such comments as: </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A Sikhs daughter 
          must be married to a Sikh" (Chapter 11, Article 18) and "A baptized 
          Sikh ought to get his wife baptized." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> What does this 
          mean? Does this mean that a Sikh's son may freely marry a non-Sikh? 
          Does this mean that a baptized Sikh wife should not encourage her husband 
          to also become a Khalsa? </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Nor must a lit 
          lamp be placed beside or a cow got bestowed in donation" (Funeral Ceremonies, 
          Article 19) </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> How realistic is 
          such a scenario ever occurring outside of rural Punjab? Not very likely. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Because of it's 
          dynamic nature and because the framework has already been laid, the 
          Rehat Maryada needs to be constantly reviewed and updated to reflect 
          current social realities. The Rehat Maryada is the document which every 
          Sikh can turn to as a guide on how the universal spiritual principles 
          of the Gurus found in Sri Guru Granth Sahib can be applied to their 
          daily lives in order to be considered a Sikh and a member of the Sikh 
          community at large. The fact that we have such a document for maintaining 
          uniformity in Sikh practices around the world is a great accomplishment. 
          But we can not rest on our laurels for having completed this great task. 
          Instead the Rehat Maryada must be constantly updated to avoid it's obsolescence. 
          It must be gender neutral, it must be geographically neutral and it 
          must be a source of answers to new social issues and concerns which 
          develop as society changes. </font>

          birth control? The current Rehat Maryada does not contain any answers 
          to any of these questions. Answers to such questions can be found in 
          the Living Guru, Sri Guru Granth Sahib, but every Sikh currently has 
          their own interpretations and views on these topics. It is precisely 
          to avoid such a plurality of views and to foster Panthic uniformity 
          as per the Sikh doctrine that we must rely on the Rehat Maryada to provide 
          us with the answers. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Sikhs always like 
          to talk and complain about what is wrong with other Sikhs, how they 
          do not follow the vision of our Gurus and what they should be doing. 
          There have been plenty of papers such as this which have clearly defined 
          what problems we face or will face and what we should be doing. There 
          is no shortage in that regard. The problem exists in having the collective 
          willpower to enact the necessary solutions. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Easy is it 
          to utter and cause to utter. But difficult is it to accept Thy Will." 
          (Guru Arjan Dev, pg. 51) </i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In conclusion it 
          is my firm belief that the solutions to any challenges that Sikhs may 
          face as a religion in the next millennia can only come about if we first 
          start to make changes to our own way of thinking and acting on the individual 
          level. The wisdom of the Gurus and their teachings are something too 
          priceless which we cannot afford to loose due to our own shortsightedness 
          or lack of vision. </font>
