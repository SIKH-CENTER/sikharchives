          <h3>Comments of Sikh Scholars </h3>
        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikhs and Sikhism 
          by I.J. Singh, Manohar, Delhi</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
Throughout Sikh history, there have been movements or subsects of Sikhism 
          which have espoused vegetarianism. I think there is no basis for such 
          dogma or practice in Sikhism. Certainly Sikhs do not think that a vegetarian's 
          achievements in spirituality are easier or higher. It is surprising 
          to see that vegetarianism is such an important facet of Hindu practice 
          in light of the fact that animal sacrifice was a significant and much 
          valued Hindu Vedic ritual for ages. Guru Nanak in his writings clearly 
          rejected both sides of the arguments - on the virtues of vegetarianism 
          or meat eating - as banal and so much nonsense, nor did he accept the 
          idea that a cow was somehow more sacred than a horse or a chicken. He 
          also refused to be drawn into a contention on the differences between 
          flesh and greens, for instance. History tells us that to impart this 
          message, Nanak cooked meat at an important Hindu festival in Kurukshetra. 
          Having cooked it he certainly did not waste it, but probably served 
          it to his followers and ate himself. History is quite clear that Guru 
          Hargobind and Guru Gobind Singh were accomplished and avid hunters. 
          The game was cooked and put to good use, to throw it away would have 
          been an awful waste.</font>

            Guru Angad:</i> However, it is strange that now-a-days in the Community-Kitchen 
          attached to the Sikh temples, and called the Guru's Kitchen (or, Guru-ka-langar) 
          meat-dishes are not served at all. May be, it is on account of its being, 
          perhaps, expensive, or not easy to keep for long. Or, perhaps the Vaishnava 
          tradition is too strong to be shaken off.</font> </p>

          As a true Vaisnavite Kabir remained a strict vegetarian. Kabir far from 
          defying Brahmanical tradition as to the eating of meat, would not permit 
          so much, as the plucking of a flower (G.G.S. pg 479), whereas Nanak 
          deemed all such scruples to be superstitions, Kabir held the doctrine 
          of Ahinsa or the non-destruction of life, which extended even to that 
          of flowers. The Sikh Gurus, on the contrary, allowed and even encouraged, 
          the use of animal flesh as food. Nanak has exposed this Ahinsa superstition 
          in Asa Ki War (G.G.S. pg 472) and Malar Ke War (G.G.S. pg. 1288).</font> </p>

          The Gurus were loath to pronounce upon such matters as the eating of 
          meat or ways of disposing of the dead because undue emphasis on them 
          could detract from the main thrust of their message which had to do 
          with spiritual liberation. However, Guru Nanak did reject by implication 
          the practice of vegetarianism related to ideas of pollution when he 
          said, 'All food is pure; for God has provided it for our sustenance' 
          (AG 472). Many Sikhs are vegetarian and meat should never be served 
          at langar. Those who do eat meat are unlikely to include beef in their 
          diet, at least in India, because of their cultural proximity to Hindus. </font> </p>

          Introduction by Dr. H.S. Singha and Satwant Kaur, Hemkunt Press, Delhi</b><br>
          In general Sikhism has adopted an ambivalent attitude towards meat eating 
          as against vegetarianism. But if meat is to be taken at all, Guru Gobind 
          Singh enjoined on the Khalsa Panth not to take kosher meat ie. Halal 
          meat slaughtered and prepared for eating according to the Islamic practice. 
          In fact it is one of the kurahits for every amritdhari Sikh. One who 
          infringes it becomes patit (apostate).</font> </p>

          by Surinder Singh Kohli, Harman Publishing, New Delhi</b><br>
          A close study of the above-mentioned hymns of Guru Nanak clarifies 
          the Sikh standpoint regarding meat-eating. The Guru has not fallen into 
          the controversy of eating or not eating animal food. He has ridiculed 
          the religious priests for raising their voice in favour of vegetarianism. 
          He called them hypocrites and totally blind to the realities of life. 
          They are unwise and thoughtless persons, who do not go into the root 
          of the matter. According to him, the water is the source of all life 
          whether vegetable or animal. Guru Nanak said. &quot;None of the grain 
          of corn is without life. In the first place, there is life in water, 
          by which all are made green&quot; (Var Asa M.1, p. 472). Thus there is life 
          in vegetation and life in all types of creatures.</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Introduction 
          to Sikhism by Dr. Gobind Singh Mansukhani, Hemkunt Press, Delhi</b><br>
          The Gurus neither advocate meat nor banned its use. They left it to 
          the choice of the individual. There are passages against meat, in the 
          Adi Granth. Guru Gobind Singh however prohibited for the Khalsa the 
          use of Halal or Kutha meat prepared in the Muslim ritualistic way.</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Introduction 
          to Sikhism by G.S. Sidhu, Shromini Sikh Sangat, Toronto</b><br>
          There are no restrictions for the Sikhs regarding food, except that 
          the Sikhs are forbidden to eat meat prepared as a ritual slaughter. 
          The Sikhs are asked to abstain from intoxicants.</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Sikh Faith 
          by Gurbakhsh Singh, Canadian Sikh Study and Teaching Society, Vancouver</b><br>
          According to the Maryada booklet 'Kutha', the meat prepared by the Muslim 
          ritual, is prohibited for a Sikh. Regarding eating other meat, it is 
          silent. From the prohibition of the Kutha meat, it is rightly presumed 
          that non-Kutha meat is not prohibited for the Sikhs. Beef is prohibited 
          to the Hindus and pork to the Muslims. Jews and Christians have their 
          own taboos. They do not eat certain kinds of meat on certain days. Sikhs 
          have no such instructions. If one thinks he needs to eat meat, it does 
          not matter which meat it is, beef, poultry, fish, etc., or which day 
          it is. One should, however, be careful not to eat any meat harmful for 
          his health. Gurbani's instructions on this topic are very clear. &quot;Only 
          fools argue whether to eat meat or not. Who can define what is meat 
          and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian 
          or a non-vegetarian?&quot; (1289) The Brahmanical thought that a religious 
          person should be a vegetarian is of recent origin. Earlier, Brahmans 
          had been eating beef and horse meat. In conclusion, it is wrong to say 
          that any person who eats meat (of course Kutha, because of the Muslim 
          rituals is prohibited) loses his membership of the Khalsa and becomes 
          an apostate.</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Scientific Interpretation 
          of Gurbani, Paper by Dr. Devinder Singh Chahal</b><br>
          The above discussion leads us to the conclusion that the Sikh Gurus 
          made people aware of the fact that it is very difficult to distinguish 
          between a plant and an animal, therefore, it is difficult to distinguish 
          between a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian diets and there is no sin 
          of eating food originating from plants or animals.</font> </p>

          of Sikhism by H.S. Singha, Hemkunt Press, Delhi.</b><br>
          The practice of the Gurus is uncertain. Guru Nanak seems to have eaten 
          venison or goat, depending upon different janamsakhi versions of a meal 
          which he cooked at Kurukshetra which evoked the criticism of Brahmins. 
          Guru Amardas ate only rice and lentils but this abstention cannot be 
          regarded as evidence of vegetarianism, only of simple living. Guru Gobind 
          Singh also permitted the eating of meat but he prescribed that it should 
          be Jhatka meat and not Halal meat that is jagged in the Muslim fashion.</font> </p>
