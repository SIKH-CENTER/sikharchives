          <h3>Preface         </h3>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following are 
        some essential thoughts on God, Guru, and His Seekers. This document will 
        serve to answer the questions frequently asked by the Sikhs and the non-Sikhs 
        on the net. Writing a complete but a short answer is very difficult. A 
        barely adequate discussion on the Sikhs can get quite cumbersome and hairy. 
        You may want to save it on a disk first. A sincere spiritual seeker will 
        find, at the least, a few useful hints here. It can be used as a concise 
        reference on the Sikh thought, also. In my opinion, this is a 'must read' 
        for those who are searching for a spiritual teacher. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the way, I am 
          not a scholar on the Sikhs. I have not studied any literature formally. 
          I hope this document is a good example of, how Sadh Sangat can influence 
          an ordinary person. As the Fifth Master has said: &quot;My friend, hear 
          from me about the miraculous rewards of a Sadhu's company. A totally 
          disabled person is able to climb over a mountain. An idiot becomes able 
          to explain the Four Vedas like a scholar. A blind person can see the 
          three worlds, as a consequence of meeting his Holy Guru …… I cannot 
          possibly describe all the supreme virtues……!&quot; (SGGS, p.809-10)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I should prefer 
          someone with better writing skills and a spiritual life to write it. 
          However, the need for dissemination of correct information about the 
          Sikh Path, in plain English, is now. It would be a shame not to share 
          what I have learned from observing some real Gursikhs (in flesh!) Most 
          of this, is simply a representation of the words of Shri Naranjan Singh 
          Ji as I heard them, and some writings based on his words. It may be 
          colored with my own understanding. As Wayne Dyer says, &quot;These words 
          are not mine,&quot; and I am no Wayne Dyer. Writing this paper has been 
          a learning experience in itself. If I waited to post it only when it 
          is perfect, it would never be posted! I expect it to evolve and rectify 
          further, as the fellow readers continue to offer corrections of my mistakes.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have adhered to 
          male gender throughout. This is for convenience only. Females are equally 
          important wheels in a Sikh household, Gurudwara, and Sikh society. They 
          are the mothers of future Khalsa (God's Own). I have paraphrased and 
          condensed most of the quotations. Because I believe that elucidation 
          of their meaning is more important, than an accurate literal translation 
          that may be confusing due to antiquity of the verse and our cultural 
          differences. Sometimes I have omitted the extensions of &quot;Ji&quot; 
          etc., for the Gurus, because respect for them is inherent to their name. 
          I have tried to avoid the use of non-English words in sentences, except 
          where there is no substitute.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of this 
          document is to represent how Guru Gobind Singh, The Tenth Master, must 
          regard today's Sikhs. Let us keep in mind that The Tenth Master's (and 
          God's) aim was to start a Panth that is stable like a rock, a Path that 
          will withstand all the storms of change in the coming generations. To 
          achieve some organization, I have arbitrarily created five categories 
          here: 1) The Anti Sikh, 2) The Common Sikh, 3) The Sikh, 4) The Gursikh, 
          and 5) Khalsa. These categories are definitely an oversimplification. 
          In a real world they often overlap, because the human life is dynamic. 
          No one's life can be pigeonholed into any one of these. Many individuals 
          move back and forth among these divisions, especially the earlier ones, 
          throughout their life.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To save time, most 
          readers could easily skip the section on The Anti Sikh, which is here 
          only to make this discussion more comprehensive. The sections on The 
          Common Sikh, and the Sikh, will be important only to the Sikhs, mostly. 
          Section on The Gursikh will be useful to all readers. If you are interested 
          only in the 'Guru', go to this section after the introduction. Those, 
          who still have nagging questions about basic Sikh philosophy and practices, 
          may have gone through the 'Terms and Phrases' section too fast. I tried 
          to be very concise, therefore, each word in that section, is important.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am deeply indebted 
          to Sandeep Singh Brar for making this article available to everyone
