          <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Retention of 
          the Five K's, Paper by Dr. Jarnail Singh</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
The baptism of a Sikh has to be voluntary act, ie., the person has to 
          offer himself, and the ceremony can be performed by five individuals 
          already baptized. The baptism in Sikhism is a further stage and a person 
          could stay in the Sikh faith for a long time without being baptized. 
          While wearing of the five K's is not obligatory for non-baptized Sikhs, 
          they do start wearing these symbols long before being baptized. In a 
          sense it is the evolution of the individual towards the final goal, 
          keeping of unshorn hair is usually the start of the process. Hence every 
          Sikh, baptized or not, has the right to wear these symbols.</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Sikhism: A Complete 
            Introduction by Dr. H.S. Singha and Satwant Kaur, Hemkunt Press, Delhi</i><br>
            The basic transformation in the concept of an ideal Sikh from Guru Nanak 
            to Guru Gobind Singh is the transformation from a Sikh to a Singh. 
            A Singh is a person who has reached the goal; who has realised the Self 
            and whose own self is therfore no more; whose ego and little personality 
            are shed off and destroyed; and who thus has no proper particular home 
            and so is designated by the generic term Singh so long as he is active 
            in the social and political context of the Sikh way of life. The term 
            Sikh on the other hand implies a person who is a learner, who is set 
            on the path of spiritual perfection and self-realization but who has 
            not yet fully realised the Self, who has not yet found the Truth in 
            entirety. When a Sikh reaches the final goal and ceases to act with 
            the fulcrum of his ego, he becomes a Singh, the perfected one. </font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Question 
            of Sikh Identity, Paper by Gurutej Singh</i><br>
            As long as Sikhs refuse to practice daily the lifestyle set down by 
            the ten Gurus, there will always be ignorance, in-fighting, slandering, 
            and lack of co-operation and communication between Sikhs as well as 
            between Sikhs and non-Sikhs. Politics will continue to take precedent 
            over prayer, because people forget how to pray or become so comfortable 
            with material possessions that prayer becomes redundant. It is only 
            through daily Sadhana, doing path, living together as community, refraining 
            from alcohol and drugs, singing Gurbani Kirtan, chanting God's name, 
            and living in God-given form, that a Sikh becomes a Sikh. To discuss 
            who's a Sikh and who's not a Sikh beyond this is meaningless. </font> </p>
