          <p><img src="images\guru6.jpg" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru 
          Hargobind was born at Wadali village in June 1595 and was the only child 
          of Guru Arjan Dev. He was invested with the Guruship on May 25, 1606 
          just days before his fathers martyrdom. From a young age he was educated 
          in the sciences, sports and religion as his father had insisted. Baba 
          Buddha was responsible for overseeing the Guru's religious teachings.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During the Guruship 
          ceremony Guru Hargobind respectfully declined to wear the Seli (woolen 
          cord worn on the head) which had been passed down on each successive 
          Guru since Guru Nanak. Instead the Guru asked for a sword. Baba Buddha, 
          never having handled a sword before, placed it on the wrong side of 
          the Guru. Guru Hargobind noticing this, asked for another sword saying 
          "I'll wear two swords, a sword of shakti (power) and a sword of bhakti 
          (meditation)." Henceforth the Guru would always carry two swords to 
          symbolize his dual role of holding secular power (Miri) and spiritual 
          authority (Piri).</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Soon after his 
          ascension to Guruship in 1606, Guru Hargobind laid the foundation of 
          a new temple at Amritsar; the Akal Takht. The Akal Takht was built facing 
          Harmandir Sahib (the Golden Temple). Guru Hargobind had a throne built, 
          and would administer Sikh affairs from here. The temporal nature of 
          the Akal Takht balanced the spiritual nature of the Golden Temple, emphasizing 
          the dual concepts of Miri and Piri introduced by the Guru. Guru Hargobind 
          donned the royal regalia of a King and was known by the Sikhs as Sacha 
          Padshah (The True King).</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Hargobind 
          knew that the Sikh's would no longer take their freedom for granted, 
          he undertook to steel his Sikhs against tyranny and oppression. The 
          Guru now gave instructions to the Masands and to all the other Sikhs 
          that they should make offerings in the future of horses and weapons 
          rather than just money. The Hindus had become so weak that they could 
          not contemplate any kind of resistance to the rulers of the date. The 
          Sikhs did not believe in self-denial alone; they grew increasingly aware 
          of the need for assertion also. They wielded arms and lived an active 
          life, reared horses, rode on them, and racing and hunting became their 
          pastimes. Guru Hargobind encouraged Sikhs in physical activity and weapons 
          training as well as prayers. Soon an army of one thousand horses was 
          raised. The spiritual side was not neglected. Guru Hargobind would rise 
          long before the day dawned and after his bath in the holy tank, would 
          go into meditation. The Guru would then join his Sikhs for prayers both 
          in the mornings and evenings. Guru Hargobind did not want his emphasis 
          on the temporal caused by the necessity for a war like posture to detract 
          his followers from the spiritual ideals of Sikhism.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Gurus military 
          activities were soon reported to Emperor Jehangir by the ever jealous 
          Chandu Shah, who still had an unmarried daughter on his hands as a constant 
          reminder of the indignity hurled at him. Guru Hargobind was summoned 
          by Jehangir and decided to go see the Emperor. Many Sikhs were apprehensive 
          about the Guru going as they feared for his life. Before setting out 
          for Delhi Guru Hargobind assigned the secular duties of running the 
          Golden Temple to the honoured Baba Buddha and the spiritual instructions 
          to the great scholar and scribe of the Guru Granth Sahib, Bhai Gurdas. 
          Guru Hargobind then set out for Delhi accompanied by three hundred horses.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When Jehangir met 
          Guru Hargobind, he was quickly won over by the young Gurus charm and 
          holiness. The Guru had a number of religious discourses with the Emperor 
          who wanted to be sure that no harm was intended to Islam by the propagation 
          of Sikhism. When asked which religion was better Hinduism or Islam, 
          Guru Hargobind replied quoting Kabir:</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"God first created 
          light, All men are born out of it. The whole world came out of a single 
          spark; Who is good and who is bad? The Creator is in the creation, and 
          the creation in the Creator, He is everywhere. The clay is the same, 
          the potter fashions various models. There is nothing wrong with the 
          clay or the potter. God the true resides in all, Whatever happens is 
          His doing. He who surrenders to Him gets to know Him. He is His slave. 
          God is invisible, He cannot be seen. The Guru has granted me this sweet 
          gift. Says Kabir, my doubts are dispelled. I have seen the Pure with 
          my own eyes." (Parbhati)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When Jehangir found 
          out that Guru Hargobind was a great lover of sports, he invited the 
          Guru to accompany him on a tiger hunt. During the chase the Emperor 
          was attacked by a ferocious tiger. The attendants accompanying the royal 
          party lost their nerve and their horses and elephants panicked. Guru 
          Hargobind rushed his horse and pulling out his sword, he engaged the 
          killed the dangerous tiger single handed. Jehangir was full of gratitude 
          towards the Guru for risking his life. Jehangir became so fond of the 
          Guru that he asked him to accompany him on a number of visits. Once 
          while visiting Agra a poor grass-cutter follower of the Guru came to 
          seem him. The grass-cutter, crying that he wanted to see the vision 
          of the True King, was led by the royal attendants into the camp of the 
          Emperor. The grass-cutter put a coin before him and stood with folded 
          hands, praying, his eyes filled with tears and his throat choked with 
          emotion. The Emperor was overwhelmed with the devotion of a loyal subject 
          and offered him a large gift. The Sikh replied, "O True King, if you 
          are so pleased, bless me with the glory of God's Name that I be emancipated." 
          When the devotee was told that he had come to the wrong camp, and that 
          the one who granted redemption was housed in the opposite camp, the 
          devotee unhesitatingly left the presence of the emperor picking up his 
          coin saying "Then this too is meant for him, not your Majesty".</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> While at Agra Jehangir 
          suddenly fell ill. The ever scheming Chandu Shah conspired with astrologers 
          to tell the emperor that he would only be cured if a holy man was sent 
          to Gwalior Fort and undertook penance on the emperors behalf. Guru Hargobind 
          was now requested to go to Gwalior Fort. Fully aware of Chandu's scheming, 
          the Guru agreed, and accompanied by an escort of five Sikhs left for 
          the fort. Guru Hargobind spent a number of months within the fort sometime 
          between 1617 and 1619 as a virtual prisoner. Here were also imprisoned 
          a number of princes who lived in deplorable conditions. Guru Hargobind 
          uplifted their spirits with daily prayers and distributed much of his 
          rations to them. Chandu Shah even tried unsuccessfully to have the Guru 
          poisoned. Eventually many months after Jehangir's recovery he was finally 
          convinced by Wazir Khan a admirer of the Guru in the mughal court to 
          release the Guru and invite him back to Delhi. Guru Hargobind refused 
          to leave the fort unless all of the princes who were political prisoners 
          were also not released. Jehangir agreed after he was reminded by Wazir 
          Khan that the emperor owed his life to the Guru.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Upon his return 
          to Delhi, Guru Hargobind told the emperor about the intrigue and scheming 
          of Chandu Shah. Jehangir handed over Chandu to Guru Hargobind to avenge 
          the death of his father Guru Arjan. Guru Hargobind handed over Chandu 
          Shah to his Sikhs who eventually took Chandu to Lahore where he was 
          killed by an indignant Sikh who had seen Guru Arjan tortured with his 
          own eyes. Upon hearing this news Guru Hargobind asked God to pardon 
          Chandu Shah's sins.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Hargobind 
          now proceeded to visit Lahore. A devout Sikh from Kabul called Sujan 
          brought a magnificent horse to present to the Guru as a gift. The horse 
          was seized by a Muslim Qazi who refused to return it unless he received 
          a large ransom. Guru Hargobind remarked that "the horse must come to 
          him to whom he was intended". Soon the horse stopped eating and its 
          health deteriorated. The Qazi sold the horse to the Guru for a minimal 
          rate, thinking that the horse would die anyway. Instead the horse regained 
          its health and Guru Hargobind would ride it regularly. The Qazi became 
          angry and felt that he had been cheated and launched a complaint with 
          the authorities. The authorities did not take any action against the 
          Guru. Meanwhile the Qazi's daughter ran away from her fathers tyranny 
          and sought refuge with the Guru at Amritsar. There she lived her whole 
          life as a devout Sikh, and Guru Hargobind got a tank known as Kaulsar 
          dug up in her memory.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Hargobind 
          now undertook extensive travels. The Guru founded the town of Kiratpur 
          in 1626 where the land had been gifted to the Guru by one of the princes 
          who had been freed from Gwalior by the Guru. While visiting Srinagar 
          the Guru had a discourse with Swami Ramdas Samrath a great spiritual 
          teacher who would later go on to instruct Shivaji, the founder of the 
          Maratha empire. Swami Ramdas asked the Guru "You are on the spiritual 
          throne of Guru Nanak, a great Saint. You are wearing arms and maintain 
          troops and horses. You allow yourself to be addressed as Sachcha Padsah, 
          the True King. What sort of saint are you?" Guru Hargobind replied, 
          "I display royalty only from the outside; inwardly, I'm detached like 
          a hermit. Guru Nanak had not renounced the world. He had only renounced 
          maya (illusion and ego)." The Swami answered that this idea appealed 
          to him and thus he thereafter changed his teachings of hindu renunciation.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> While visiting 
          the shrine of Guru Nanak, Guru Hargobind met and received the blessings 
          of Baba Sri Chand, Guru Nanak's son. Soon thereafter in 1613 a son was 
          born called Gurditta. In 1617 another son was born, Suraj Mal. In 1618 
          a third son, Ani Rai was born and in 1620 Atul Rai was born. Finally 
          in 1622 the last and fifth son, Tegh Bahadur was born. During the life 
          of Guru Hargobind some of the most influential Sikhs of the time passed 
          away. Baba Buddha passed away in 1631 at Ramdas, Bhai Gurdas in 1636 
          at Goindwal and Baba Sri Chand at Kiratpur in 1629. In October 1627 
          emperor Jahangir died and Shah Jahan ascended the throne in Delhi.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The mughal emperor 
          Jahangir was out hunting one day in the vacinity of Amritsar. A favorite 
          hunting hawk of the emperors flew into the camp of Guru Hargobind who 
          was also hunting. When the emperors soldiers came to reclaim the hawk, 
          a brief skirmish ensued and the hawk was not returned. Jahangir was 
          so enraged that he sent an army of 7000 cavalry under the command of 
          his general Mukhlis Khan to recover both the hawk and capture the Guru 
          for his insolence. In the ensuing battle the Gurus forces emerged victorious 
          after the Guru killed Mukhlis Khan in single combat with his sword. 
          This battle took place in 1634. This battle marked a turning point as 
          the Sikhs now turned militant under mughal persecution.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After the battle 
          Guru Hargobind left Amritsar never to return. The Guru shifted to Kartarpur 
          and went on to build the city of Hargobindpur on the banks of the river 
          Beas. The local villagers who were members of the Gherar tribe were 
          very excited, but the headman of the tribe Bhagwan Das did not want 
          the Guru to settle there. Bhagwan Das who was friendly with the mughal 
          authorities made derogatory remarks against the Guru, the Sikhs lost 
          their temper and in the insuing scuffle, Bhagwan Das was killed. His 
          son Ratan Chand went to Abdullah Khan the Subedar of Jullundur and convinced 
          him to attack the Guru at Hargobindpur with a force of 10,000 troops. 
          The Guru felt that he was being forced into a fight when all he wanted 
          was to be left alone to pursue his religious pursuits. He said, "We 
          are fighting for a righteous cause - our right to live with honour and 
          in peace - and not for the sake of self glory or rule over others."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A fierce battle 
          ensued in which the Gurus forces were only half of the invading mughals. 
          Karam Chand the son of Chandu Shah joined Rattan Chand the son of Bhagwan 
          Das for revenge. In the ensuing battle both the Subedar Abdullah Khan 
          as well as his two sons were killed. Rattan Chand was also killed while 
          Karam Chand was captured by the Sikh Bidhi Chand. Guru Hargobind ordered 
          Karam Chand released but he soon returned to battle again. At this Guru 
          Hargobind engaged Karam Chand in single hand to hand combat without 
          any weapons and killed him with his bare hands. The mughal forces were 
          completely defeated and forced to retreat. After the battle the construction 
          of a Gurdwara at Hargobindpur resumed and the Guru ordered that a mosque 
          also be built for Muslims.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Friction with the 
          mughal authorities were to continue. A group of devoted Sikhs from Afghanistan 
          were on their way to present the Guru with two extraordinary horses. 
          The horses were seized by the Muslim authorities at Lahore and presented 
          to Shah Jahan who was visiting there. When the Sikhs heard about this, 
          Bidhi Chand decided to rescue the horses for the Guru. He gained the 
          confidence of the keeper of the royal stable at Lahore first disguised 
          as a grass cutter and then as a magician. Both times he was able to 
          safely spirit away both horses to the Gurus household. The fact that 
          the mughals would retaliate was a foregone conclusion, therefore Guru 
          Hargobind shifted his base deep into the forest in the district of Nabha. 
          Here a large contingent of mughal troops sent by the emperor under the 
          control of Lala Beg found there way. A bloody battle lasting 18 hours 
          took place in which the Sikhs suffered over 1,200 casualties but were 
          able to inflict even heavier losses to the mughals and send them retreating 
          in defeat. This battle took place in 1631.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Before the death 
          of Guru Nanaks son Baba Sri Chand, he asked Guru Hargobind if he could 
          adopt one of the Gurus sons since he had no children. Out of respect 
          for Sri Chand, Guru Hargobind offered him the choice of his eldest son 
          Baba Gurditta. Baba Sri Chand then chose Baba Gurditta as his successor. 
          Baba Gurditta who was married to Natti gave birth to a son called Dhir 
          Mal who was to later cause much trouble to the Guru and his family. 
          In 1630 Baba Gurditta had another son called Har Rai who was to prove 
          to be a blessing. The son of Guru Hargobind, Atal Rai started displaying 
          his supernatural powers by performing miracles and revived a dead playmate 
          of his. When Guru Hargobind heard about this he reprimanded his son 
          saying, "My son has started dissipating his spiritual powers without 
          discrimination. Shall our occupation now be to revive everyone's dead 
          son and interfere ever in God's will, we who are enjoined to accept 
          whatever good or bad comes to us in His pleasure." Atal Rai took the 
          Guru's reprimand so seriously that he soon passed away after that. His 
          death caused Guru Hargobind much grief and he constructed a nine storey 
          structure called the Bunga of Baba Atal at Amritsar to commemorate the 
          nine short years of his sons life.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Trouble soon evolved 
          among some of the Gurus troops. One of the Gurus favorite soldiers Painda 
          Khan let the honour and gifts presented to him by Guru Hargobind go 
          to his head. He gave the choice gifts which he had personally received 
          to his son in law Asman Khan who also captured one of the Gurus favorite 
          hunting hawks and refused to return it. When Guru Hargobind asked Painda 
          Khan for an explanation he replied in a rude and insulting manner. Therefore 
          the Guru regrettably terminated the services of Painda Khan. The disgruntled 
          Painda Khan along with 500 troops loyal to him approached the emperor 
          in Lahore and offered to join the imperial forces against the Guru. 
          The emperor was pleased to have the help of such a close confidant of 
          the Gurus. Painda Khan told the emperor that the Gurus army was only 
          composed of poor peasants. In the year 1634 Fifty thousand troops under 
          the command of Kale Khan and supported by Painda Khan were dispatched 
          to attack the Sikhs at Kartarpur. When the Gurus forces heard about 
          the impending attack, Dhir Mal the Gurus grandson sent a secret letter 
          to Painda Khan pledging him his full support. The battle was fierce 
          with Guru Hargobinds two sons Gurditta and Tegh Bahadur also fighting 
          along with their father. Many great soldiers fell on the battlefield 
          including Kale Khan. The mughal forces were decimated until among the 
          remaining Painda Khan engaged Guru Hargobind in battle. Guru Hargobind 
          had raised Painda Khan from a young age and loved him like a son, therefore 
          he refused to strike the first blow. Painda Khan struck two times unsuccessfully 
          missing the Guru both times. Painda Khan continued to taunt and insult 
          the Guru until finally Guru Hargobind killed him with his sword. Seeing 
          his body in the dust, Guru Hargobind clasped his old comrade in his 
          arms and put his shield over Painda Khan's face to shade it from the 
          scorching sun. Guru Hargobind then wept over the death of one so dear 
          to him and prayed that God grant Painda Khan forgiveness and a place 
          in heaven. In another part of the battlefield Baba Gurditta also wept 
          at killing another mughal general Asman Khan who had been his childhood 
          friend. The mughal forces were successfully routed and retreated with 
          heavy losses although the Sikhs suffered over 700 dead.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Immediately following 
          the battle Guru Hargobind and his family left Kartarpur to retire to 
          the out of the way town of Kiratpur in order to avoid further bloodshed. 
          Here the Guru had also promised to visit a Muslim devotee of his Budhan 
          Shah who was near death and had previously met Guru Nanak. The Gurus 
          grandson Dhir Mal refused to move, instead he remained in Kartarpur 
          and with possession of the original copy of the Granth Sahib which he 
          refused to hand over. Dhir Mal had aspirations of succeeding Guru Hargobind 
          as the next Guru because he had the Holy Granth. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here are Kiratpur 
          Guru Hargobind remained the rest of his life peacefully. He kept a small 
          army of men and 900 solders as his protection. The Guru continued to 
          receive countless devotees who flocked to Kiratpur to hear and see the 
          Guru and Sikhism continued to spread throughout the Indian Subcontinent. 
          The most accurate eye witness account of Guru Hargobind's life appears 
          in the Dabistan-i-Mazahib written by the Muslim Mohsin Fani. In this 
          he writes about the Sikhs, "The Guru believes in one God. His followers 
          put not faith in idol worship. They never pray or practice austerities 
          like the Hindus. They believe not in their incarnations, or places of 
          pilgrimage nor the Sanskrit language which the Hindus deem to be the 
          language of the gods. They believe that all the Gurus are the same as 
          Nanak. The Sikhs are not restricted in the matter of eating and drinking."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Soon the Guru received 
          the shocking news of the death of his eldest son Baba Gurditta who passed 
          away at age 24. He passed in much the same manner as Atal Rai, having 
          taken to heart the reprimand of the Guru for reanimating a dead cow 
          of an angry farmer which he had accidentally killed while out hunting. 
          Guru Hargobind was much saddened by the death of his son and requested 
          his grandson Dhir Mal to appear for his fathers last rites and receive 
          his fathers turban. Dhir Mal refused to come even on such a solemn occasion, 
          only caring about styling himself as the next Guru, especially now with 
          his fathers untimely demise.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Hargobind 
          now started training his grandson Har Rai the other son of Baba Gurditta 
          as his natural successor. The Gurus own sons; Gurditta had passed away, 
          Suraj Mal and Ani Rai were too worldly while Tegh Bahadur preferred 
          solitude and meditation. Har Rai was a pious young man and Guru Hargobind 
          proceeded to train him in the use of arms as well as spiritual matters. 
          At the age of fourteen Har Rai was ordained by Guru Hargobind as the 
          seventh Sikh Guru. Guru Hargobind bowed before Guru Har Rai as his successor. 
          Soon thereafter Guru Hargobind passed away in 1644 having in his lifetime 
          transforming the Sikhs into soldier-saints. </font>
