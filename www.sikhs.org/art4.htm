        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the paper &quot;Why 
          Sikhism&quot;? I discussed my personal experiences in how I had dealt with 
          issues in my life. I focused on myself as a child and as an adult, and 
          the primary conflicts that Sikhs face during these periods of their 
          life. Acceptance as a child and as an adult, but love playing a greater 
          role in our lives as adults.</font>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My focus was to 
          highlight how Sikhs living in a western society have to deal with problematic 
          issues, where certain western values don't blend with Sikh religious 
          principles. I also brought up the point that I was &quot;lucky&quot; to know of 
          the Sikh religion, which helped guide my decisions, but unfortunately 
          many of today's young grow up ignorant to what Sikhism is. Below I have 
          listed 13 points why I think Sikhism is the best religion in the world, 
          and what it has to offer to Sikhs and to the World, and why Sikhs should 
          not abandon their faith, but strive harder to understand it, learn about 
          it, and they will realize once they do, that it is worth keeping, holding 
          on to, prizing in our hearts and souls.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 1. Sikhism does 
          not look down upon people who follow other religions as &quot;inferior, non-believer, 
          etc&quot;. That is one reason why you don't see Sikh Missionaries actively 
          pursuing conversions. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 2. Sikhism is a 
          religion of Equality. Equality between Men and Women and also stressing 
          &quot;universal equality&quot; amongst all human beings. Which all other religions 
          do not have. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 3. Sikhism is a 
          modern way of life, it doesn't subject people to valueless rituals. 
          A few examples being the caste system, bathing in holy rivers, facing 
          a certain direction for a prayer, slaughtering animals in the name of 
          God, circumcision.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (NOTE: I'm talking 
          of Sikhism, not cultural practices.. which at times are not up to date 
          with the teachings of the religion, as can be seen in all religions))</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 4. Sikhism, is 
          a religion of worship of One God. A God that has no 'chosen people', 
          a God compassionate to all, God not bonded to a &quot;single religion&quot;, God 
          to be found and realized by all, God that is not pleased with ritualistic 
          behavior, a God that is only pleased by &quot;ANYONE&quot; who with true devotion 
          LOVES HIM, yes a God for all the UNIVERSE.. not of Jews, Sikh, Hindus, 
          Muslims,etc. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> God himself spoke 
          to Guru Nanak Ji the founder of Sikhism on the &quot;Day of Revelation&quot;, 
          when Guru Nanak Ji was called to God' home and given his directives 
          to preach to this world.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> God spoke the following 
          verse on this most blessed day to Guru Nanak Ji and the entire world. 
          Known as the Mul Mantra. The very first verse written in the Guru Granth 
          Sahib Ji (the Sikh scripture) and found at many other places before 
          other hymns in the Guru Granth Sahib Ji.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ik Onkar (God is 
          One)<br>
          Sat Nam ( His name is True)<br>
          Kartaa Purakh (He is the Creator)<br>
          Nirbhau (He is without fear)<br>
          Nirvair (He is inimical to none)<br>
          Akal-murat (He never dies)<br>
          Ajooni (He is beyond births and deaths)<br>
          Saibhang ( He is self illuminated)<br>
          Gurprasaad (He is realized by the kindness of the True Guru)<br>
          Jap (Repeat His Name)<br>
        </font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And in God's court 
          Guru Nanak spoke the following, which God accepted and condoned, and 
          comes write after &quot;Jap&quot;.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Aad sach (He is 
          True in the beginning, (before the anything (universe) existed)<br>
          Jugaad sach (He was True when the ages commenced and has ever been True)<br>
          Hai bhi sach (He is also True now)<br>
          Nanak hosi bhi sach. ((Satguru) Nanak (says that) he will be certainly 
          True in the future.)</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 5. Sikhism believes 
          in reincarnation. As the worldly science is improving and people are 
          starting to realize this phenomenon is true (through hypnosis and near-death 
          experiences) they will understand the &quot;Greater Glory&quot; in the Sikh scriptures 
          to have realized this concept while others don't believe in it at all. </font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Note: Only Hinduism 
          and Bhudism share these values of reincarnation, and many Christians 
          are starting to believe it, and though Muslims rejects this notion, 
          I believe many believe of it as well.)</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 6. Sikhism stresses 
          that God judges all people as to their actions in this world. It does 
          not matter what religion he practices, or was born to. Hence the theory 
          of Karma is also a part of Sikh religion.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The ultimate reward 
          in Sikhism is to be freed from the PAINS of 'births and deaths' that 
          Humans undergo. Reflect for a few minutes, and think of how much do 
          we as people suffer in life? We suffer a tremendous amount! The older 
          you are the more you will know of it.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Unlike other religions, 
          which offer a heavenly paradise, where one is rewarded with Virgins 
          (only for the males as one scripture has it) and rivers of wine (which 
          ironically is not sanctioned for one to drink here on this earth). Sikhism 
          rewards people with the concept of becoming &quot;one with God&quot;. Where the 
          soul is emersed back into the Godly soul, like a raindrop is emersed 
          into the ocean and hence find ever lasting bliss. (Never to be reborn 
          again)!</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This is for both 
          MALE and FEMALE. No sexism is in the scripture. I challenge all to have 
          a look for themselves, and they will be happily surprised that a religion 
          born 500 years ago, has accepted the equality of sexes as well as people, 
          which not even today's western society has, nor any other religion has. 
          This is just one reason why I adore the Sikh religion. Men and Women 
          are Equal in all respect.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 7. In Sikhism, 
          Men and Women are able to carry out prayer rights. There is no priest 
          class, unlike other religions, which is controlled by men. Hence again 
          women are equal partners in Sikhism. Sikhism is a very egalitarian religion.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 8. &quot;Sikhism is 
          an intellectual way of life&quot;! Sikhs are told very strongly, explicitly, 
          to seek knowledge within the Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Knowledge is the 
          &quot;key&quot; to enlightenment. One must understand the Guru's written words 
          in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, in order to help themselves transcend 
          this worldly ocean and reach the higher spiritual goals given to Humankind 
          by God. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The challenge of 
          being a Sikh is truly a hard one, the majority of the world of today 
          have not the courage in them, nor the will power, nor are the willingness 
          to spend time to pursue this &quot;intellectual&quot; and &quot;spiritual&quot; journey 
          and achieve that ultimate state of ETERNAL BLISS. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> People not wanting 
          to face this challenge, since it is a difficult one, a long one, is 
          why people are unaware of the greatness of their Sikh religion. They 
          continue to play in this world (metaphorically speaking) in the pursuit 
          of trying to find happiness, yet never achieve it. Happiness is only 
          temporary. It is eternal bliss (Anand) that we want, which the Guru 
          guides us on how to achieve, in the Guru Granth Sahib Ji.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Happiness (Bliss) 
          can not be bought with riches, etc. Happiness is a state of mind. Bliss 
          is the state of being one with our mind, soul, and heart. One can only 
          find it by being able to control (cleansing) the mind, which Sikhism 
          stresses one to do, with God' Naam (Name. Then only will one achieve 
          true lasting happiness (bliss) within ourselves.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I challenge the 
          readers to spend some time, to read up on the lives of Sikh Gurus, read 
          the Sikh scripture, along with the other religions open mindedly, and 
          Sikhism will pass as the most objective, logical, equal, humanitarian 
          religion. A good place to start is Sandeep Singh's WWW home page.The 
          Sikhism Home Page: http://www.sikhs.org/</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 9. Sikhism is a 
          religion which builds character. It tells its followers to be &quot;hard 
          workers&quot; to earn their daily bread. To share this with others, as well 
          as to remember the Lord in their heart. Hence within Sikhism, there 
          is a compassion towards all of humanity, a fact of social reform.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 10. Sikhism is 
          the only religion that allows all people, of any caste, colour, creed, 
          religion to come to &quot;ANY&quot;! of their holy places, without restriction, 
          and be given equal respect in all matters.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> They are served 
          in the Gurdwara (Sikhs holy temple), in the kitchen with the same dignity 
          as if they were Sikhs. They are allowed to participate in Singing Hymns 
          on stage even if they are not Sikhs. They are allowed to read the Guru 
          Granth Sahib Ji (if they know how to read Gurmukhi Script) even if they 
          are not Sikhs. They are allowed to discuss Sikhism in these places of 
          worship even if they are not Sikhs. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A very good example 
          comes to mind is Bhai Chaman Lal even though he is a Hindu. He sings 
          Gurbani hymns all over in Gurdwaras and tells wonderful stories of the 
          Gurus. Sikhs respect and give him equal dignity, even though he is not 
          a Sikh.&quot; I personally love his singing and his stories. He's more of 
          a Sikh than I am. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hence one does 
          not have to even change religion, to follow Sikh practices and sing 
          the Glories of God using Sikh scripture and that truly is the greatness 
          of Sikhism.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 11. Sikhism allows 
          one to follow the path to enlightenment, at their own speed. This enlightenment 
          comes with their own understanding and awareness of the message in the 
          Guru Granth Sahib Ji and how much effort they have given to incorporate 
          it in their lives. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Sikhism allows 
          people to interpret the Guru Granth Sahib for themselves (unlike other 
          religions) and with increasing awareness and understanding, the person 
          will gain greater (deeper) understanding of the &quot;divine&quot; words of the 
          Gurus, who were in direct communication with God and wrote what God 
          told them in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 12. Sikhism is 
          the only religion where the Scripture is written by the Prophet of the 
          religion who was in divine communication with God, out of all the other 
          worldly religions whose scriptures were written later by people. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 13. Sikhism is 
          the only religion that has in its Scripture, Hymns of Divine saints 
          who had attained that state of perfection and communion with God in 
          life. Be them Muslim or Hindu (from every caste). Hence Sikhism is truly 
          a religion that has broken down barriers between religions, to show 
          the world that, &quot;anyone&quot; can reach God by immersing themselves in His 
          love. That is why Hindu and Muslim saints divine hymns from God are 
          also recorded in Guru Granth Sahib Ji.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Sikh Gurus are 
          not only honoring the achievement of these Saints throughout time, but 
          are sending a message to the world. Sikhism is not the property of those 
          who are born in Punjab or to Sikh families. It is a religion for all 
          of humanity, men and women, be them of any caste, creed or colour and 
          be them born to any religion in the world. Sikhism is for all of humanity, 
          let us not forget the entire universe.</font> </p>
