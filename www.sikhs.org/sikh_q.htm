          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adopting the physical 
          symbols or taking the Khalsa baptism ceremony alone does not make one 
          a Gursikh (Sikh of the Gurus). It is a step in the right direction but 
          a full commitment to living the Sikh lifestyle both physically and spiritually 
          is required to be a Gursikh and true Khalsa of Guru Gobind Singh.</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Whosoever assumes 
            a religious garb pleases not God even a bit. O ye men, understand this 
            clearly in your minds, that God is attained not through showmanship. 
            They who practice deceit, attain not Deliverance in the Hereafter. They 
            do so only to accomplish the affairs of the world and even the kings 
            worship them for their appearance! But through showmanship, God is attained 
            not, howsoever one searches. He who subdues his mind alone recognizes 
            the Transcendent God.&quot;</i> (Guru Gobind Singh, Chaupai 53-55, Chapter 
            6, Vachitra Natak, Dasam Granth)</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;The disguiser 
            puts on various garbs. Within him is desire, and he walks about proudly. 
            His ownself he understands not and loses the game. Putting on religious 
            garbs some play clever. Love of maya and doubt have supremely misled 
            them. Without serving the Guru, they suffer immense pain. They who are 
            imbued with God's Name, ever remained detached.&quot;</i> (Guru Amar Das, 
            Gauri, pg. 230)</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Indulging in 
            egotism, one knows not the Lord, whatever religious garb he may wear.&quot;</i> (Guru Nanak, Gauri, pg. 226)</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;He who calls 
            himself a Sikh of the True Guru, he should get up in the early hours 
            of the morning and remember the Name of the Lord. He should make effort 
            to rise before the day dawns and take a bath in the pool of nectar. 
            Under the instructions of the Guru, he should repeat the mantram of 
            the Guru, all his troubles will end and all his sins and blemishes will 
            be destroyed. Then when the day dawns, he should sing the bani of the 
            Guru and remember the Name of the Lord while sitting or moving. He who 
            remembers my Lord with every breath and loaf, that Gursikh is liked 
            by the Guru. He on whom my Lord showers His Blessings, the Guru instructs 
            that Gursikh. I beg for the dust of the feet of that Gursikh, who not 
            only repeats the Name of the Lord but also makes others to repeat it.&quot;</i> (Guru Ram Das, Var Gauri)</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;In this body 
            (lamp), put the oil of the practice of reciting the religious books 
            and the wick of Lord's fear. Light this lamp with the fire of the knowledge 
            of the Truth.&quot;</i> (Guru Nanak, Sri Rag, pg.25)</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Those who are 
            absorbed in the Name of the Lord, all their eatables, clothes and maya 
            are pure; their houses, temples, palaces and rest-houses are all pure, 
            in which the Gurmukhs, devotees, and the praying Sikhs live or stay; 
            their horses, saddles and sacks are all pure on which the Gurmukh Sikhs 
            and saints take a ride; their actions of piety are all pure, who repeat 
            and remember the Name of the Lord; those who are destined to be virtuous, 
            such Gurmukh Sikhs go to the Guru&quot;</i> (Guru Ram Das, Var Sorath)</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;O Gursikhs, 
            always remember the Name of the Lord, the True Guru and the Lord will 
            make the life comfortable in your home, O Gursikhs, consider the bani 
            of the Guru as True, the Lord Himself issues it through his mouth. The 
            dear Lord Himself purifies the mouth of the Gursikhs and Himself makes 
            the whole world proclaim loudly the Praises of the Guru. I am the servant 
            of the Lord, who protects the honour of his servants.&quot;</i> (Guru Ram 
            Das, Var Gauri)</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;The True Guru 
            is the ocean of pearls, one attains it according to his Writ. The Sikhs 
            like swans gather together according to the Will of the True Guru. The 
            ocean is full of gems and pearls, the swan eats them, but the ocean 
            always remains full. The Lord wills that the ocean and the swans are 
            not separated. Only that Sikh comes to the Guru, on whose forehead this 
            Writ is recorded from the very beginning. Such a Gursikh not only ferries 
            across the world-ocean, himself, but also saves his family and the whole 
            world.&quot; </i>(Guru Arjan, Var Ramkali, pg. 960)</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;The True Guru 
            is the field of Dharma, in which one reaps whatever one sows. The Gursikh 
            sow the nectar and get the ambrosial fruit of God. They are pure in 
            both worlds and in the Court of the Lord, they receive a robe of honour.&quot;</i> (Guru Ram Das, Var Gauri) </font> </p>
