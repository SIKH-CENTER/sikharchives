          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru Arjan the 
          Fifth Sikh Guru compiled the original version of the Guru Granth Sahib. 
          The Guru's older brother Prithi Chand as well as others had started 
          passing off some of his own compositions as the hymns of the Gurus. 
          Guru Arjan realized that if this situation was allowed to continue 
          it would be the undermining of the Sikh religion. The Sikhs needed an 
          authentic compilation of the hymns of their Gurus. Thus Guru Arjan 
          started collection the original verses of all the Gurus. He sent trusted 
          Sikhs such as Bhai Piara, Bhai Gurdas and Baba Buddha across the country 
          in search of original manuscripts. Guru Arjan made trips to Goindwal, 
          Khadur and Kartarpur to visit the families of the previous Gurus. Guru 
          Arjan collected original manuscripts of the Gurus from Mohan (son 
          of Guru Amar Das), Datu (son of Guru Angad) as well as Sri Chand (son 
          of Guru Nanak). </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Arjan 
            now pitched a tent by the side of Ramsar tank in Amritsar and started 
            the arduous task of compiling the first edition of the Holy Guru Granth 
            Sahib. Bhai Gurdas was entrusted as the Guru's scribe for the master 
            copy. The monumental task was finally completed after a number of years. 
            This original edition of the Guru Granth Sahib known at that time as 
            Pothi Sahib was installed on a high pedestal within the Harmandir Sahib 
            in August 1604. Guru Arjan seated himself at a lower level and instructed 
            all Sikhs to bow before it, not as an idol, but as the book of divine 
            inspiration which instructed living men in the ways of God and dedicated 
            secular life. The revered Baba Buddha was appointed the first Granthi 
            (custodian) of the book. Guru Arjan dictated that unlike the Hindu 
            scriptures, the Pothi Sahib could be open to reading by anyone of any 
            caste, creed or sex.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Arjan 
            provided the following epilogue;</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Three things 
            are there in the vessel; Truth, contentment and intellect. The ambrosial 
            Name of God is added to it, The Name that is everybody's sustenance. 
            He who absorbs and enjoys it shall be saved. One must not abandon this 
            gift, It should ever remain dear to ones heart. The dark ocean of the 
            world can be crossed by clinging to His feet. Nanak, it is He who is 
            everywhere.&quot; (Guru Arjan Dev, Mundawani)</i></font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pothi Sahib (known 
            today as the Kartarpur Bir) was kept by the Sixth Master Guru Hargobind 
            in his house. From here it was stolen by his grandson Dhir Mal who intended 
            to use it to further his claims on the succession of the Guruship. Some 
            thirty years later the followers of the Ninth Master, Guru Tegh Bahadur 
            forcibly recovered it, but were instructed by the Guru to return it. 
            They placed it in the shallow river bed of the Satluj River. From here 
            Dhir Mal recovered it, miraculously it was undamaged. Throughout the 
            eighteenth century it most likely remained with Dhir Mal's family, the 
            Sodhis of Kartarpur, thus the name Kartarpur Bir (Bir means volume). 
            The Holy Book next emerged from obscurity in 1849. In that year following 
            the annexation of Punjab, the volume together with its golden stand 
            were discovered by the British in the custody of the Lahore royal court. 
            An application was received from Sodhi Sadhu Singh of Kartarpur and 
            in 1850 the volume was returned to his family. The Kartarpur Bir is 
            preserved to this day and installed monthly for worshippers.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> An unauthorized 
            edition of the Guru Granth Sahib know as the Banno Bir also exists. 
            Guru Arjan gave this copy of the Granth Sahib to Bhai Banno one 
            of his disciples to take to Lahore for binding. Bhai Banno kept this 
            volume and wrote in some verses of Sudras and Mirabai which it is believed 
            had been rejected by the Guru as well as a few hymns allegedly to be 
            by Guru Nanak at the end of his Granth. Guru Arjan did not approve 
            the Banno Bir. This copy is still in the possession of the descendants 
            of Bhai Banno.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Dhir Mal even refused 
            to return the Kartarpur Bir over to Guru Gobind Singh, The Tenth and 
            Final Master. While at Talwandi Sabo (known as Damdama Sahib today) 
            Guru Gobind Singh undertook to prepare a new edition of the Granth Sahib 
            including in it all of the hymns appearing in the original edition as 
            well as the hymns of his late father, the Ninth Master Guru Tegh Bahadur. 
            The Guru dictated the entire Granth to his scribe Bhai Mani Singh. Out 
            of his humility, Guru Gobind Singh who was a great and profuse writer 
            and poet only included one of his hymns. </font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The great task 
            was finally completed in 1705. The Damdama Sahib Bir was then taken 
            to Nanded where it was installed as desired by the Guru. Near the end 
            of his life Guru Gobind Singh ended the line of personal Guruship by 
            investing the Granth Sahib with the status of Eternal Guru and his official 
            successor in 1708. Bhai Nandlal one of Guru Gobind Singhs disciples 
            recorded the Guru's words as; &quot;He who would wish to see the Guru, Let 
            him come and see the Granth. He who would wish to speak to him, Let 
            him read and reflect upon what says the Granth. He who would wish to 
            hear his word, He should with all his heart read the Granth.&quot; (Rahitnama) 
            In 1721 Mata Sundri the widow of Guru Gobind Singh instructed Bhai Mani 
            Singh to go to Harmandir Sahib as the head Granthi along with the Sacred 
            Volume. This Sacred Volume which was carried by the Sikhs before their 
            troops on march was tragically lost in battle during the Second Sikh 
            Holocaust - Wadda ghalughara on February 5th 1762. Fortunately since 
            a number of copies had been made, this text has survived to today become 
            the official authorized version of the Guru.</font></p>
