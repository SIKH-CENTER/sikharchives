        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think that quote 
          really describes the way I view this web site. It's all about celebrating 
          and sharing with others. It's not about being selfish and keeping what 
          you know or have learned to yourself or trying to use the pretext of 
          religion to make money. That's why you won't find this web site on a 
          commercial CD being sold to make money. It's here on the Internet for 
          anyone in the world to access free of charge, not requiring any membership 
          or money from anyone. Read, learn, think, contemplate, discuss and enjoy.</font>

          <br>
          The mandate of this web site is very specific and that is to be a learning 
          resource about Sikhism. It's not meant to be an entertainment site, 
          nor is it meant as a social site. It's purely focused on being a learning 
          resource and nothing else. Why? Because that is my specific area of 
          interest. I will leave the presentation of such topics as post-Guru 
          Sikh history and the political/human rights struggle in Punjab to others 
          who have expertise in those areas. My passion is Sikhism and that is 
          where I enjoy devoting my spare time.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Internet is 
          a very powerful medium, in the wrong hands in can easily be used to 
          spread misinformation with damaging consequences. In this regard I have 
          made a concerted effort to present information about Sikhism while respectfully 
          remaining within the parameters of The Rehat Maryada which is The Official 
          Sikh Code of Conduct. There are a number of theological issues where 
          Sikh scholars differ and there is debate or variance. As a Sikh, I have 
          presented my views on some of them, but at all times I have been very 
          respect to not contradict either the Rehat Maryada or the Akal Takht, 
          which is the governing temporal Sikh authority.</font>

          Sikhism Home Page</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          <br>
          It all started back in October of 1994, the World Wide Web was a lot 
          smaller place back in those days and I noticed that there were no web 
          sites about Sikhism. A group was working on The Punjab Home Page and 
          I volunteered to write something about Sikhism for that web site. What 
          started out as an idea to write a simple essay soon grew to encompass 
          a lot more and over the Christmas holidays in 1994 I finished and launched 
          the first version of The Sikhism Home Page. Since then things have never 
          been the same for me. It has taken over most of my free time. I have 
          plenty of ideas and have worked away to implement them one by one over 
          the years given my limited resources, time and finances. The web site 
          has a life of its own and is a dynamic ever changing and growing entity 
          so this is really a project without an end. The current web site is 
          the sixth major revision of the web site. As an artist I like to change 
          it's look at least once a year. Other than being the worlds first web 
          site on Sikhism, some other pioneering firsts include the first complete 
          version of Sri Guru Granth Sahib on the Internet, the first Sikh audio 
          files on the Internet, the first Sikh video on the Internet and the 
          first photographic documentation of the historical Gurdwaras of Punjab 
          in any form. From my one solitary web site I have seen a rapid explosion 
          of Sikhism related web sites over the years. I think this is a very 
          positive development as others are starting to realize the power of 
          the Internet. It really is the dawning of a new age in human communications 
          as there has never been any media like this in history for the transmission 
          of thoughts and ideas.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Sikhism and Religion</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          <br>
          This web site is an expression and extension of my love affair with 
          my religion. I am not an authority or expert on Sikhism and neither 
          is religion my profession or educational background. I am just a simple 
          Sikh on the path of discovery and learning. What a wonderful path it 
          has been. This Sikhism Home Page is all about sharing whatever I have 
          come across with others. The philosophy and religion are so progressive 
          and applicable to everyone that it's quite amazing and fills me with 
          a sense of enthusiasm in sharing it with others.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The shame is that 
          few people either Sikh or non-Sikh have made any sort of concerted effort 
          to study the religion in any depth. Many people are ready to make quick 
          judgements on the religion based on very little. Non-Sikhs are ready 
          to dismiss it as an obscure faith while marginal Sikhs are ready to 
          give it up for a more glamorous &quot;mainstream&quot; religion without 
          ever having made any effort to understand Sikhism and the beauty of 
          Sri Guru Granth Sahib, which comes across in Gurmukhi or even an English 
          translation. Others fail to make the clear distinction between culture 
          and religion, deciding to judge the religion by the culture. A religion 
          is a set of unchanging fundamental principals laid out by its founders. 
          It needs to be judged on those principals, their merits and applicability, 
          not on the actions of any individual who chooses not live up to those 
          principles. For example any law in the legal system is judged on its 
          social and ethical merits and not by the attributes of the criminal 
          who chooses to break that law. Judged accordingly its quite amazing 
          how progressive and modern a religion Sikhism is, free of the entanglements 
          of mythologies, blind rituals and prejudices.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
          all religion is what you make it.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although a major 
          religion in the east, Sikhism remains relatively unknown in the west. 
          Why is a major world religion which has more followers than even Judaism 
          for example (20 million vs. 13 million) largely ignored by the mainstream 
          education system and media in the west? I see a couple of possible reasons. 
          First there is a lack of easily available material on Sikhism in English. 
          Even if it exists, in many cases it is either out of print, very hard 
          to get, poorly written or incorrect and misleading. Secondly Sikhism 
          is not a missionary religion, there are no concerted missionary efforts 
          to convert followers of other religions to Sikhism. You won't find the 
          equivalent of Christian missionaries full of religious zeal to convert 
          people to 'the only right path' to reaching God and salvation. Instead 
          Sikhism believes that there are many paths to reaching God and Salvation, 
          following the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and their way of life is one 
          of them, but not necessarily the only exclusive path. The progressive 
          teachings of the Gurus on the equality of mankind and not needing to 
          renounce ones worldly social obligations in order to achieve salvation 
          are quite progressive ideas. Sikhism follows a low key approach, rather 
          than a heavy handed in your face approach that some religions choose 
          to take when dealing with people of another faiths. Here it is, this 
          is what it's all about, if you like it embrace it your most welcome, 
          that's Sikhism.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hopefully The Sikhism 
          Home Page can do something about addressing these shortcomings and I 
          feel that it is successfully doing that based on the tremendous positive 
          response in emails that I have received from around the world over the 
          years.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many people today 
          look down on religion as a waste of time, they are busy bowing down 
          before the mighty dollar god and see economic salvation as the only 
          thing that counts in life. Their ethics, dealings with others and entire 
          worldview are completely defined around the economics of materialism. 
          Theirs a lot more to life than that, rich people have just as many problems 
          as poor people. Rather than viewing religion or Sikhism as a hindrance 
          or a distraction in life, I view it as a guiding compass and a strength 
          to draw upon in leading my daily life. Sikhism is not some heavy anchor 
          around my neck, neither do I look at it as a set of restrictions getting 
          in my way every day. Instead it's something that provides a sense of 
          purpose, guidance, strength, motivation and inspiration.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Physical 
          Symbols</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          <br>
          The physical symbols of Sikhism are a natural extension of that expression 
          of love for the religion. Looking different from everyone else is a 
          source of strength and motivation to be a better person. Not only are 
          you now automatically accountable to a set standard of ethics and behaviors 
          as part of a collective recognizable group, but you are also an ambassador 
          for Sikhism through your actions. Either people feel hatred or a sense 
          of security when they see a policeman, it's up to the policeman to create 
          that positive image and to live up to his responsibilities if he chooses 
          to join the police force. Looking in the mirror, wearing the turban 
          and physical symbols of Sikhism inspires me to live up to the high standards 
          set by the Gurus. I honestly fail a lot more often than I succeed and 
          am far from an ideal Sikh, but at least I have a goal and high standard 
          as my guide and inspiration. The physical symbols provide no scientific 
          or physical superiority, nor do they need such justifications for their 
          existence or relevance. They are all about love for Sikhism and the 
          Gurus and self-motivation. If one questions their practical validity 
          than you are not in love with your religion. Until a person is in love, 
          they can never understand why you do what you do, you have to experience 
          that love yourself and be willing to fall in love in the first place. 
          Love cannot be intellectualized, forced or blindly acted out, it has 
          to come from within. If one loses track of that love, than the physical 
          symbols are reduced to nothing more than a blind ritual, which is something 
          the Sikh Gurus went out of their way to condemn. Looking like a Sikh 
          but not acting like a Sikh is a useless waste of time as you become 
          nothing more than a walking contradiction to the very founding principles 
          of Sikhism.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Whosoever 
          assumes a religious garb pleases not God even a bit. O ye men, understand 
          this clearly in your minds, that God is attained not through showmanship. 
          They who practice deceit, attain not Deliverance in the Hereafter. They 
          do so only to accomplish the affairs of the world and even the kings 
          worship them for their appearance! But through showmanship, God is attained 
          not, howsoever one searches. He who subdues his mind alone recognizes 
          the Transcendent God.&quot; (Guru Gobind Singh, Chaupai 53-55, Chapter 
          6, Vachitra Natak)</i></font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand 
          deciding to act like a Sikh but not look like a Sikh is also a halfhearted 
          approach. Why aim for failure, why not aim for success - to look and 
          act like a Sikh. If that is your goal, I don't care if you are there 
          yet or not, if your hair is cut, or if you fail to live up to the spiritual 
          standards fully yet, you are still a Sikh. As long as you have love 
          and respect for the path laid out by the Gurus, you are a Sikh. But 
          if you decide to outrightly reject either the physical or spiritual 
          principles of Sikhism for whatever reason as not being and never being 
          applicable to you then you have made a conscious decision not to be 
          a Sikh. In that case that is your right and choice but with that choice 
          you loose the privilege of calling yourself a Sikh. Sikhism is a package 
          deal not a buffet dinner where you pick and choose what you want and 
          what you don't want. Either one embraces the religion with love and 
          enthusiasm or you reject it, the ultimate choice is really your own. 
          The definition of a Sikh in the Rehat Maryada is broad enough to encompass 
          anyone who wants to follow the Sikh path, irrespective of where they 
          may currently be as they start out on that path. It's a very personal 
          journey, all of us may not complete that journey in this life or may 
          be at different levels but at least we are all on the same path, the 
          Sikh path.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>About Me</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          <br>
          In the big picture its important to keep in mind that the message is 
          more important than the messenger. One very important thing that I cannot 
          overemphasize is that I am just an ordinary Sikh. Not wiser or better 
          than anyone else. Just a Sikh on the spiritual path of learning and 
          discovery. English is my main language of preference although I can 
          speak Punjabi and read Gurmukhi. One very frustrating thing I found 
          growing up was the lack of material on Sikhism in English. Hopefully 
          I can lessen that frustration for others through this web site. I enjoy 
          graphic arts, photography, computers and Sikhism, so this web site provides 
          a perfect natural outlet for my interests. One thing that Sikhism teaches 
          is that you don't have to renounce the world in order to be a religious 
          person, you can enjoy life, fulfill your obligations to family and society 
          while pursuing the spiritual path to self improvement and enlightenment. 
          I am a husband and father, work for a computer company and find that 
          Sikhism is truly a way of life and living for me rather than a specific 
          activity unto itself.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Financial Support</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          <br>
          I am not affiliated with any organization or group and have never received 
          any major funding from anyone. The entire project has been supported 
          by me, and I am not a wealthy person although I wish I was. My dream 
          is to be able to work on this web site and the promotion of Sikhism 
          full time, maybe one day that dream will come true. Irrespective of 
          what has been done so far on my own part-time, I could take it to a 
          much higher lever and scope if I had some funding and resources behind 
          me. I continue to receive plenty of praise from individuals and organizations 
          but disappointedly have never received any funding from them. I have 
          received offers to send donations from students, but have refused them 
          because I don't feel that its morally right to ask someone with limited 
          funds going through school for money. If you are a organization or individual 
          who is financially stable and you see the value and merit of my work, 
          than please help support it financially. When I receive an email from 
          someone telling me that they have learned more about their religion 
          from my web site than from going to Gurdwara for 20 years, than I know 
          that it's worth it. When someone writes to me that they have printed 
          out Japji Sahib from the web site and read it every day or listen to 
          the audio file than I know it's worth it. When someone writes to me 
          that they are rediscovering their religion for the first time than I 
          know it's worth it. When a child or a schoolteacher writes to thank 
          me for help in their class project than I know it's worth it. I receive 
          such emails all the time and that is the greatest motivation to keep 
          going with what I do, to know that I have helped make a positive difference 
          in the life of someone in the world. That is the true meaning of the 
          Sikh idea of Seva - selfless service for the sake of humanity, not for 
          material or personal gain. This project is too important to ever be 
          hindered by a lack of funds or resources. No matter what it takes I 
          have made a unwavering commitment to this project. I will never compromise 
          its integrity or quality for financial or personal gain, that is a promise. 
          If you need an excuse not to fund this project, I am sure that you will 
          find one, for example I am not a charitable organization because that 
          process is expensive so I cannot provide a receipt for tax write-off 
          purposes. But if you share my dream and vision and can see the value 
          of what is being accomplished here and the lives that are being touched 
          than you will help.</font>
