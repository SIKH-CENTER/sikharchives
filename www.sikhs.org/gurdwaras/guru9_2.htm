Gurdwara Baba Bakala, Dist. Amritsar</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru 
        Harkrishan before he died in 1644 had said that his successor could be 
        found at Bakala. When Sikhs flocked there they were confronted with 22 
        members of the Gurus family each claiming that they were the Guru. Meanwhile 
        a wealthy merchant Makhan Shah had his ships carrying valuable cargo caught 
        in a fierce storm at sea. He vowed to offer five hundred gold coins to 
        the Guru if his goods safely reached home. The ships reached port safely 
        and Makhan Shah made his way to Bakala to pay homage to the Guru. When 
        he finally got there he was confronted with all the same quandary as the 
        rest of the Sikhs, who was the real Guru? Being a businessman Makhan Shah 
        decided that he would pay homage to all of the twenty two claimants and 
        placed two gold coins before each of them as tribute. When he had visited 
        all of the claimants, a child pointed out to him that a holy man lived 
        across the street. Makhan Shah decided that he may as well pay him tribute 
        also. When Makhan Shah entered the house he found that Guru Tegh Bahadur 
        was in meditation. He was told that Tegh Bahadur who had lived here in 
        quiet meditation for many years did not like to receive visitors. Makhan 
        Shah waited until he met the Guru and placed two gold coins before him. 
        At this Guru Tegh Bahadur smiled and said to Makhan Shah, “I thought that 
        you had pledged five hundred coins”. Makhan Shah became so elated that 
        he kissed the Gurus feet and started shouting from the rooftop “I’ve found 
        the Guru, found the Guru!”. All the Sikhs rushed to the house of the quiet 
        saint and when they heard the story there was much rejoicing for many 
        days. Thus the pious, humble saint Tegh Bahadur was acclaimed here as 
        being the true Guru of the Sikhs and natural successor of Guru Harkrishan.</font></p>
