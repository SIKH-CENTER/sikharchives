          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
        gurdwara commemorates the spot of the bloody battle of Chamkaur. After 
        the attack at the river Sarsa, Guru Gobind Singh, his two eldest sons 
        and 40 Sikhs made it to the town of Chamkaur while being pursued by an 
        army of 1,000. Guru Gobind Singh and the 40 Sikhs sought shelter in a 
        mud-built double story house. They were attacked by the enemy on December 
        22, 1705. Against these overwhelming odds, the Sikhs ventured our in small 
        groups to fight the enemy and bravely lay down their lives. Thirty Seven 
        Sikhs were martyred that day including Guru Gobind Singhs two eldest sons 
        as well as three of the Five Beloved Ones (the first baptized Khalsa). 
        Guru Gobind Singh himself was preparing for battle and martyrdom, but 
        the five remaining Sikhs in the fort enacted the scene at Anandpur, where 
        they were had the authority of Guruship and Gobind Singh their Khalsa 
        disciple. Quoting the Gurus words giving them authority to issue resolutions, 
        they ordered Guru Gobind Singh to escape the fort at night followed by 
        three of the five remaining Sikhs. </font></p>
