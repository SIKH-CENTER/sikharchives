          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Spiritual Heart <br>
Darbar Sahib (The Golden Temple), Dist. Amritsar</b></font></p>
          <p><img src="images\golden0.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Harmandir Sahib (meaning Temple of God) is also commonly known as the 
        Golden Temple or Darbar Sahib (Divine Court). Darbar Sahib is a living 
        symbol of the spiritual and historical traditions of the Sikhs. It is 
        a source of inspiration for all Sikhs. 
        The temple with it's glistening gold covered exterior stands in the middle 
        of the tank of nectar. The Darbar Sahib has entrances and doors on 
        all four sides. Guru Arjan exclaimed; &quot;My faith is for the people 
        of all castes and all creeds from whichever direction they come and to 
        whichever direction they bow.&quot; Guru Amar Das asked Ram Das to build a 
        central place of congregation for the Sikhs. Guru Ram Das started excavation 
        work in 1577 during his lifetime. Guru Arjan completed excavation 
        of the Tank known as Amritsar (The Pool of Nectar) in 1588. Guru Arjan 
        then started construction of the Temple building itself which was 
        finally completed in 1601. The first edition of the Holy Book of the Sikh's 
        The Guru Granth Sahib was installed there in 1604 with Baba Buddha as 
        the first granthi (caretaker of the book). The last Sikh Guru to live 
        in Amritsar was Guru Hargobind. In 1664 Guru Tegh Bahadur visited Darbar Sahib but was refused entry by the corrupt temple caretakers, 
        the Masands. Darbar Sahib has always been a rallying point for Sikhs 
        throughout it's history. Around 1740 Massa Ranghar, the Muslim ruler of 
        Amritsar desecrated the Temple by using it as a dancing hall. He was killed 
        by the Sikh hero Mahtab Singh. In 1761 the Afghan Ahmed Shah Abdali blew 
        up the Temple and filled in the Sacred Tank with refuse. The great Sikh 
        martyr Baba Deep Singh laid down his life in revenge. The construction 
        of the Darbar Sahib as it appears today was begun in 1764 when Jassa 
        Singh Ahluwalia laid the foundation stone. Many of the doors, walls and 
        domes were covered with copper sheets overlaid with gold during the reign 
        of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Darbar Sahib was partially damaged by the 
        military invasion of the Indian Army during June 1984.</font></p>
