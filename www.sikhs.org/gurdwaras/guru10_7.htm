        is the birthplace of the Khalsa. It was here on March 30th, 1699 that 
        a very large gathering of Sikhs had arrived at Anandpur Sahib as per Guru 
        Gobind Singhs instructions. After prayers Guru Gobind Singh stood up with 
        his sword and asked the gathering of thousands, &quot;Is there anyone here 
        ready to lay down his life at my call? This sword of mine is crying for 
        the blood of a dear Sikh of mine.&quot; The congregation was shocked and afraid, 
        the third time Guru Gobind Singh repeated his call, Daya Ram stood up 
        and offered his head. Guru Gobind Singh took him into a tent. The sound 
        of a sword cutting a body was heard and blood trickled out of the tent. 
        Guru Gobind Singh emerged from the tent and asked for another Sikh. Dharam 
        Das stood up and volunteered. Again the same episode was repeated. Three 
        more Sikhs offered their heads to the Guru in the same way, Mukham Chand, 
        Himmat Rai and Sahib Chand. After some time Guru Gobind Singh brought 
        the five Sikhs before the congregation dressed in new clothes and revealed 
        to the congregation that he had really slaughtered five goats inside the 
        tent. Guru Gobind Singh then baptized them with amrit (sweetened water) 
        stirred with his Khanda, The Guru called them his Five Beloved Ones and 
        gave them the last name ‘Singh’ which means Lion. Guru Gobind Singh then 
        humbly bowed before the Five Beloved Ones and asked them to initiate Him 
        into the Khalsa Brotherhood. Never in history has the leader of a religion 
        bowed down before his followers for baptism. Some of the original weapons 
        of Guru Gobind Singh as well as the khanda (two edged sword) used by the 
        Guru to stir the amrit (sweet water) during the Khalsa baptism ceremony 
        are kept here.</font></p>
