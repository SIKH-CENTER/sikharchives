<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the enemy troops 
  of Wazir Khan were approaching Guru Gobind Singh they were intercepted 
  by a force of 40 Sikhs led by a village women Mai Bhago. Earlier during 
  the prolonged siege of Anandpur Sahib, 40 Sikhs had deserted the Guru 
  by signing a letter saying that they were no longer Sikhs of the Guru. 
  They lived in the Malwa region in which Guru Gobind Singh was now staying. 
  Here they were shamed by their women folk for having deserted the Guru. 
  Mai Bhago dressed in soldiers uniform gathered the 40 deserters to help 
  Guru Gobind Singh and they engaged the approaching army of Wazir Khan 
  at this spot. While the enemy had a large force they was tired from 
  their long march while the outnumbered Sikhs were fresh. In the fierce 
  battle the ensued the Sikhs were able to scatter the enemy who were 
  forced to retreat after having suffered severe casualties and because 
  of the lack of drinking water in the area. Although the Sikhs emerged 
  victorious, all 40 former deserters were killed in battle. Guru Gobind 
  Singh was deeply touched by the sacrifice of the 40. As Guru Gobind 
  Singh surveyed the battle scene, one seriously wounded Sikh Mahan Singh 
  was still alive and before he died he begged Guru Gobind Singh to forgive 
  the 40 for having deserted him earlier. Guru Gobind Singh blessed the 
  40 and said that they had achieved 'Mukhti', spiritual liberation for 
  their brave act of self sacrifice. </font></p>
