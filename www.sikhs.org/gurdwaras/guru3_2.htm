            Amar Das was forced to leave Goindwal by Datu the son of Guru Angad who 
            was jealous at not being named the Guru by his father. Datu told Guru 
            Amar Das to leave Goindwal, and being the humble person that he was, Guru 
            Amar Das returned to his family village of Basarke. Here the Guru shut 
            himself up in a small hut with a note on the door, ‘He who opens this 
            door is no Sikh of mine, nor am I his Guru.’ When a delegation of Sikhs 
            lead by Baba Buddha finally found the hut they were perplexed as what 
            to do. Finally they decided to make a hole in the wall so as not to go 
            against the Gurus injunction. Once inside they pleaded with the Guru to 
            return to Goindwal as only he was their true beloved Guru and the Sikhs 
            could not live without him. Guru Amar Das finally relented and returned 
            with the Sikhs. The hole in the wall is still preserved today inside the 
            Gurdwara.</font></p>
