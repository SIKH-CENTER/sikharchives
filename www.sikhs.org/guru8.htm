          <p><img src="images\guru8.jpg" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru 
          Harkrishan was born on July 7, 1656 to Guru Har Rai and Krishan Kaur. 
          Before his death in October 1661 Guru Har Rai had appointed his younger 
          son Harkrishan as the next Guru as opposed to his elder son Ram Rai 
          who was in collusion with the mughals. Guru Harkrishan was only five 
          years old when he received the guruship.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Gurus older 
          brother Ram Rai complained to emperor Aurengzeb in Delhi that he had 
          been discriminated against because of his loyalty to the emperor and 
          had not received his due share of the property of his father Guru Har 
          Rai. Ram Rai knew that before his death Guru Har Rai had instructed 
          Guru Harkrishan to never meet Aurengzeb. Ram Rai hoped if Guru Harkrishan 
          met the emperor he would be going against his fathers wishes and the 
          Sikhs would be displeased with their Guru. On the other hand if Guru 
          Harkrishan refused to come to Delhi, then he would be attacked by the 
          emperors forces. Since Aurengzeb was very friendly with Ram Rai he summoned 
          Guru Harkrishan to appear before him in Delhi. The Sikhs were very apprehensive 
          about allowing young Guru Harkrishan to go to Delhi. Aurengzeb sent 
          Raja Jai Singh a high court official known for his devotion to the Gurus 
          to escort the Guru to Delhi.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Raja Jai Singh 
          assured the Guru that he would not have to meet the emperor personally 
          while in Delhi, and that there were a large number of devotees in Delhi 
          who were anxious to see and hear their Guru. Guru Harkrishan convinced 
          the Sikhs at Kiratpur that he should go to Delhi. As a result Guru Harkrishan 
          along with his mother and a group of devotees set out for the long journey 
          to Delhi. On their journey the Guru was met by large crowds of devotees. 
          At Panjolhara an jealous Brahmin taunted the Guru, "Your Guru is called 
          Hari Krishna, a mere child of eight years! Krishna, the incarnation 
          of Vishnu, uttered the Gita which is the repository of all the eternal 
          truths, If your Guru also calls himself Krishna, let him expound the 
          truths of Gita to us". Hearing this a poor watercarrier called Chhajju 
          stood up and proclaimed that anyone could expound on the Gita if he 
          were so blessed by the Guru. Guru Harkrishan touched Chhajju with his 
          walking stick and Chhajju immediately began explaining the philosophy 
          of the Gita. The Brahmin was so humbled by the spectacle that he fell 
          to the Gurus feet and asked forgiveness for his arrogance.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Upon reaching Delhi 
          the Guru and his party were the guests of Raja Jai Singh who had promised 
          to uphold the safety of the Guru. Every day large numbers of devotees 
          started flocking to see the Guru. At this time a smallpox epidemic was 
          raging in Delhi. The Guru helped to heal many sick people, naturally 
          coming in contact with so many people every day, the Guru was also infected 
          and taken seriously ill. On March 30, 1664 Guru Harkrishan decided to 
          announce his successor, the Guru called for five coins and a coconut. 
          He took them and being too weak to move, waved his hand three times 
          in the air and said "Baba Bakala". Guru Harkrishan then suddenly passed 
          away at the tender age of eight years old. </font>
