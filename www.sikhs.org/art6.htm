        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I was in my parents 
          gurdwara over the holidays and I don't think I understood even 10 percent 
          of what was said. This is due to my inadequate understanding of Punjabi,&quot; 
          a youth remarked recently.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This is definitely 
          a &quot;problem&quot; especially with the Sikh youth in the Western countries. 
          The inadequate knowledge of Punjabi stems probably from the fact that 
          parents don't put an effort to speak Punjabi at home... especially when 
          their kids are young. Many among both the parents and the children, 
          say that because they spend better part of the day around the English 
          speaking people, they don't get a chance to speak Punjabi.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Lately I have come 
          across programmes in gurdwaras being conducted in English! Is the use 
          of English in gurdwaras the trend of the future in the West? Should 
          the use of English in gurdwaras be encouraged to attract the youth, 
          or opposed as a dilution of the Sikh culture and practices. A controversy 
          is continuing on the topic among the Sikhs here. Here are some points 
          and counter-points:</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I am sure that 
          many young Punjabis, especially those born and raised in the US/Canada/UK 
          would benefit from more English being used in the gurdwaras. The coming 
          generations in the West are certainly not going to be as conversant 
          in the Punjabi language as the community is today, and so English will 
          become increasingly useful in the future as well.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> However, there 
          is an inherent problem with using English in gurdwaras in the sense 
          that a lot of stuff just doesn't translate adequately or in English 
          could sound really &quot;strange&quot;. Also it would have to be a dual language 
          delivery as we have a large number of those who do not understand English 
          at all.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On the other hand 
          many young Punjabis would benefit from learning the Punjabi language. 
          We speak enough of English in the work-place; places like the gurdwaras 
          and our homes are the only places where we can really be in touch with 
          our very own language. The use of English even in gurdwaras paves the 
          way for the extinction of Punjabi! The community should make an effort 
          to teach Punjabi to the young and not try to preach the sermons in English!</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> English is necessary 
          in order that the ceremonies can be comprehended fully by a majority. 
          Most of those attending can comprehend everything said in English, and 
          only a few, mainly older folks, can comprehend the Punjabi well. The 
          crucial point is that the elders are already knowledgeable about the 
          religion, and the ceremonies in English won't hurt them, whereas, the 
          young folks are the ones who need to be informed about religion and 
          the best way to do so is to inform them in the language they comprehend 
          best - not the language that the elders feel more comfortable with.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> English will have 
          to be accepted if the religious tradition is to continue strong. However, 
          some young people must be adept at Punjabi in order to be able to be 
          the torch-bearers in the future and serve the community. Also every 
          Sikh should have some knowledge of Punjabi so as to comprehend Gurbani 
          and Sikh History well. Conscious effort is needed to learn Punjabi, 
          but it is not hard with so many Punjabi speaking people around. I feel 
          the youngsters will do well to make hay while the sun shines. Gurbani 
          can be appreciated fully only if one can comprehend it without a translation.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In one of his books, 
          Essays in Sikhism, first published in 1944, Teja Singh, the late principal 
          of Khalsa College, Amritsar, addressed this problem in the following 
          way: &quot;As long as Sikhism had to deal with people whose language was 
          akin to Punjabi or Hindi, it had all possibilities of advance. But as 
          soon as it came in contact with people who could not be approached in 
          the original language of the Sikh Scriptures, the attempt failed, because 
          those responsible for the missionary work were not yet certain whether 
          they could use translations in place of the original. ?This is the problem. 
          Can Malayalam, or for that matter any other language, serve the purpose 
          of the Guru's Word? If Sikhism is to go to America or England, which 
          language is to be used by the new converts, English or Panjabi? They 
          will have to recite prayers individually, and approach God in their 
          own tongue. How can their prayer be realistic if offer it the original 
          Panjabi or Hindi?&quot;</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> How this scenario 
          plays out only time will tell. There are good arguments from either 
          side. I personally feel that increasing use of English in gurdwaras 
          of the West is inevitable. I would rather put more emphasis on keeping 
          the youth engaged in Punjabi culture by bringing them to the gurdwara, 
          not forgetting to celebrate the Sikh festivals, visiting Punjab, and 
          speaking Punjabi at home as much as possible.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If I may end on 
          a personal note: After having been in America since 1963 it pleases 
          me so much to hear, both in America and on visits to India: &quot;You still 
          speak such good Punjabi!&quot;</font> </p>
