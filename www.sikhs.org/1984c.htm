          Sahib Singh, the head Granth of Sri Darbar Sahib, had his residence 
          in Shaheed Bunga Street on the back side of Sri Darbar Sahib. Indian 
          forces had initiated their attack on Sri Darbar Sahib at 4:45am on the 
          morning of June 4. Under the battle conditions and intense exchange 
          of fire, Singh Sahib fulfilled his duties on June 5 until noon. However, 
          on June 6 he was not allowed to reach Harmandir Sahib for his duties. 
          Other Giani Sahibans, including Giani Mohan Singh Ji and Giani Puran 
          Singh Ji, were forced to remain inside, even after the completion of 
          their regular duties on June 5 evening. They simply could not leave 
          the premises. Following is an excerpt from an interview by BBC Journalist 
          Harbir Singh Bhanwer with Singh Sahib Giani Sahib Singh. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          When were you able to first return to Sri Darbar Sahib after Operation 
          Bluestar and what were the conditions as you saw them?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          Giani Mohan Singh Ji and Giani Puran Singh Ji, accompanied by some soldiers, 
          reached my house around 5am of June 7. They informed me that General 
          Sahib had summoned for me and instructed me to get ready in 15 mins. 
          and accompany them. I left escorted by the soldiers. The Atta Mandi, 
          Katdha Dal Singh and back anteroom (Deodhi) of Sri Darbar Sahib was 
          full of soldiers. There were thousands of soldiers everywhere. We were 
          stopped at every place and questioned, "who is he? kill him." Soldiers 
          escorting me responded, "he is the head priest." Upon reaching the Darbar 
          Sahib complex, inside I saw Sikhs seated all over the parkarma with 
          their hand tied behind their backs with their own turbans. Among them 
          were the Gurdwara employees. Giani Sujan Singh, Sant Bhindrawale's helper 
          and SGPC member, was among the detained Sikhs. At the foot-steps of 
          the parkarma, we were met by an arrogant Sikh Cornel. When the accompanying 
          soldiers informed him about me, he promptly ordered "if he is the head 
          Granthi, bring him inside." Parkarma had 6-7 tanks. Dead bodies were 
          everywhere. I inquired from the Sikh Cornel if I could meet with the 
          detained Sikhs. He replied that his orders are against it. However, 
          when I informed him that our own staff was among the detained, he suggested 
          that I could watch but not speak with them. He further emphasized that 
          if I talked with anyone, I will be killed. Baba Deep Singh Ji Shaheed's 
          Bunga was full of detained Sikhs. As they saw me, they started crying. 
          Some requested if I could seek permission for them to drink water from 
          the sarowar. Who so ever spoke was mercilessly beaten by soldiers with 
          gun-butts and subjected to derogatory verbal abuse saying, "Sala asks 
          for water!" I informed the Sikh Cornel that GurSikhs regularly organize 
          "Shabeels" to gratuitously distribute water, and requested permission 
          to distribute water among the detained Sikhs. Indian forces could be 
          seem in all buildings of Sri Darbar Sahib. Reference library was burning 
          at this moment. The whole parkarma was in bad shape with blood, red 
          ammunition shells, and broken glass. There was no place to put your 
          foot down. The soldiers accompanying me suggested that I wear my shoes. 
          However, I refused and proceeded bare-foot. At the Shabeel corner someone 
          fired at me. Fortunately, I escaped. Now the soldiers escorting me were 
          yelling "He is the head priest" but no one was listening to anyone. 
          I was shoot at once again near the Lachi Baer Gurdwara. This bullet 
          missed and hit the floor near me. Near Lachi Baer Gurdwara, Sri Akal 
          Takhat's courtyard was filled with dead bodies. Soldiers were everywhere. 
          The Darshani (Deodhi) anteroom, Janda Bunga, New anteroom, everywhere 
          soldiers were positioned with entrenched machine guns and LMGs. The 
          historical Lachi Baer tree was badly brutalized. The nearby room for 
          Palki Sahib was badly littered with scattered rumalas. With a deeply 
          saddened heart and great difficulty, I reach thus far. The Darshani 
          (Deodhi) anteroom was full of drunken soldiers who were smoking cigarettes. 
          When these soldiers saw me, they started hurling derogatory verbal abuses 
          at me, "who is this Sala?" Almost all soldiers were abusive. They couldn't 
          utter any words without using derogatory terms. From the doorsill till 
          the bridge, the Darshani anteroom was filled with rubbish. The bridge 
          was heavily guarded with armed soldiers. Sri Harimandir Sahib was also 
          heavily guarded. The situation inside Sri Harimandir Sahib wasn't any 
          better. The carpets used for June 5 could not be replaced on June 6. 
          Ammunition shells and broken glass littered the insides as well. There 
          were 6-7 Sikh soldiers including a granthi and two Cornels when I reached 
          inside. They informed me that General Sahib had left after a long wait 
          for me. They instructed me to conduct Sri Guru Granth Sahib's Prakash 
          and initiate kirtan and other services. By now I had been informed by 
          other Singh Sahibans that the sacred copy of Sri Guru Granth Sahib had 
          been hit by a bullet.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          The sacred copy of Sri Guru Granth Sahib that was hit by a bullet, was 
          that in use in the main hall or on the first story?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          This copy was in prakash in Sri Harimandir Sahib. At Har-Ki-Paudi a 
          Sikh was reading from Guru Granth Sahib, when a bullet hit a window 
          and broke its glass. A piece of that glass cut Pathi Sikh's hand. It 
          is this Sikh's blood that you find on the rumalas. The Central Reserve 
          Police Force (CRPF) had previously riddled Sri Darbar Sahib with bullets 
          from all corners on June 1. The next day, June 2, wasn't any better 
          either. In consultation with Tohra Sahib, on the morning of June 4, 
          all Akhand Paths were concluded and all sacred copies of Sri Guru Granth 
          Sahib were moved in safekeeping after their 'sukhasan'. However, the 
          Akhand Path at Har Ki Paudi was allowed to continue and completed on 
          the morning of June 6. Because of the curfew imposed by the Indian forces, 
          our employees could not reach Sri Darbar Sahib to assume their duties. 
          As a result most pathis had to recite Path for 8-10 hrs. continuous.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          When was Sri Guru Granth Sahib's Prakash conducted?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          First of all we cleaned the insides of Sri Harimandir Sahib. The Sikh 
          soldiers helped me with this task. Sukhasan of the sacred copy of Sri 
          Guru Granth Sahib that was hit by a bullet was conducted next. Then 
          the Sri Guru Granth Sahib copy was brought from Lachi Baer Gurdwara 
          and the prakash was accomplished around 10am. There was no Kadha Prakash 
          served. A Sikh Subedar brought some sweet-meat prepared from sugar (Patasae) 
          from somewhere, that was served instead.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          Then which Shabad's kirtan was initiated?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          When the two Cornels inside Sri Harimandir Sahib, Shamindar Singh and 
          Sharma, asked me to organize shabad kirtan, I expressed the need for 
          a significant staff to conduct such program. They asked me in return 
          where to get the required staff. Upon which I informed them of the Gurdwara 
          employees among the detained Sikhs outside and asked for their release. 
          They agreed to my suggestion and escorted me to where the Sikhs were 
          detained. As I pointed out our staff members, their hands were sniffed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          (Astonished) Why did they sniff their hands?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          I didn't know either. Apparently, the hands used in firing guns can 
          be identified through smell. It can also be identified from the fingers. 
          Based on my request 15 Sikhs were released. The rest were considered 
          prisoners and sent to camps. Among the released were Hajuri Ragi Mohinder 
          Singh's tabla companion Bhai Gurcharan Singh (who could perform kirtan 
          as well), Surma Singh Karamjeet Singh who could play tabla, and Sant 
          Bhindrawale's Ragi Bhai Harbhajan Singh. For several days these individuals 
          conducted the kirtan. The information regarding kirtan being performed 
          by military personnel in your diary is inaccurate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          Who did the Ardas?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          This too was done by Sri Darbar Sahib's Ardassia Bhai Harpal Singh. 
          All these individuals stayed in my house for several days. Upon seeking 
          their release I took them to my house. Several of them had blood stains 
          on their cloths. They bathed and washed their clothes. Several of them 
          had to use my cloths.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          Shabad kirtan started being relayed on radio from June 8, who organized 
          this program? SINGH SAHIB: The radio and electricity workers arrived 
          on June 7. They installed the necessary wires, etc. Military personnel 
          brought a loudspeaker from some Hindu individual. We returned it afterwards.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          When were the dead bodies removed?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          Giani Zail Singh was to arrive on June 8. So the Indian force removed 
          all dead bodies from the parkarma path from Ghanta Ghar anteroom towards 
          Baba Budha's Baeri tree. But the bodies were left elsewhere. Even the 
          sarowar had 10-12 floating bodies. I witnessed on June 7 that a Sikh 
          ran out from a room along the parkarma and jumped into the sarowar. 
          The soldiers immediately opened fire and killed him in the sarowar itself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          Did you learn anything about Sant Bhindrawale?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          We learned on June 7 that his dead body was displayed in the Ghanta 
          Ghar's anteroom. However, we weren't allowed to go there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          Tell us about Giani Zail Singh's visit?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          On the day of Giani Zail Singh's visit, some soldiers took me towards 
          the Langar building. All stories of this building were filled with soldiers. 
          Dogra regiment was stationed here. Cornel Bajwa and one other Cornel 
          informed me that some Sikhs were holed in Ramgharia Bunga. They had 
          taken one Captain Doctor hostage. Furthermore, these Sikhs had conveyed 
          that if 5 Singh Sahibans asked them to drop their weapons they will 
          comply. Giani Puran Singh was with me. As we approached the bunga, we 
          saw two GurSikhs seated with their backs tied to each other in front 
          of the Bunga. We asked the Cornels that if the Sikhs drop their weapons 
          would they not shoot them? They promised that if these Sikhs haven't 
          killed any of their men, they will be spared. Within the Ramgharia Bunga, 
          approaching from Baba Kharak Singh's Dera side we spoke with the Sikhs 
          over a small loudspeaker. We told them that "if you have any military 
          hostages, release them and come out, you will not be killed." We could 
          hear some noises but couldn't understand what was being said. Finally 
          we heard that they did not have any hostages. Upon hearing this the 
          Cornel asked us to leave and said they will handle it from here. Giani 
          Zail Singh's arrival was fast approaching.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          Was firing ongoing when Giani Zail Singh arrived?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          Firing was continuously ongoing here at one place or another. However, 
          your report that a security personal of Giani Zail Singh's escort was 
          shot is inaccurate. When Giani Zail Singh arrived, one of his escort 
          had an umbrella covering him. I sent a sewadar and asked for the removal 
          of the umbrella. They obliged. Giani Zail Singh paid respect upon reaching 
          Harimandir Sahib. The question of honoring him with saropa simply did 
          not arise. He asked some officer to contact me. Upon meeting, Giani 
          Zail Singh first inquired about the Jathedar of Sri Akal Takhat Sahib, 
          Giani Kirpal Singh. I told him that he was safe. Then he asked about 
          the attack. I summarized the events. Further I told him that the soldiers 
          were moving around with naked heads, with boots, and continuously drinking 
          and smoking within the premises. Their behavior was inappropriate and 
          derogatory. Whenever they see a Sikh, they kill him without asking any 
          question. Hundreds of Sikhs have been killed this way. Additionally, 
          the sacred places are being abused by them. They have done worst things 
          than the mughals. How could all this happen under a Sikh President? 
          Giani Zail Singh told me that Shrimati Ghandi did not tell him anything. 
          He said that he wanted to visit on June 7 but couldn't. He said, "even 
          today I have managed to come after great difficulty." I told Giani Zail 
          Singh that the soldiers misbehaved with me and my staff. They make our 
          job difficult. Why not arrest us too? He immediately ordered the four 
          generals, Sundar Ji, Dayal, Baradh and Jamwaal to provide security. 
          I further explained that the soldiers have looted the homes of our staff 
          including Giani Sahibans. Giani Mohan Singh has been badly beaten, arrested 
          and taken away. They wanted to burn the markets behind Sri Darbar Sahib 
          complex. I later learned that the military had planned to burn the whole 
          street around my house and the Kolsar Bazar. They were saved by Giani 
          Zail Singh. Giani Zail Singh saw the sacred copy of Guru Granth Sahib 
          that was injured with a bullet. He had also witnessed the state inside 
          Sri Harimandir Sahib. Thus upon reaching Delhi, he immediately sent 
          a package of Rumalas. I thought even though Giani Zail Singh is a Sikh, 
          the rumalas are government property and therefore did not use them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          Sardar Bhan Singh and Sardar Abinashi Singh were brought from camps 
          by soldiers for Sri Darbar Sahib's visit, when were they brought for 
          the first time?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          Probably they were brought on June 8. Interior Minister, Butta Singh, 
          first arrived here on June 9. subsequently he visited everyday. On June 
          9, I, Giani Kirpal Singh Ji, Sardar Bhan Singh, Sardar Abinashi Singh 
          met with Butta Singh inside Sri Harimandir Sahib and exchanged views 
          about various processes. Subsequently, committees were organized to 
          take care of treasury (Tosha Khana), Museum, and Historical weapons 
          and slowly the processes started improving. I had informed the military 
          on June 7 itself that five Singh Sahibans will collectively make all 
          decisions and take any actions. However, the Jathedar of Sri Akal Takhat 
          is the supreme authority. He individually can take any decision. Until 
          June 16, all Singh Sahibans had gathered together.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HARBIR SINGH:</b> 
          Your interview on Doordarshan, was that given of your free will or under 
          the pressure of military guns?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SINGH SAHIB:</b> 
          Punjab situation was dangerous at that moment. Giani Kirpal Singh had 
          already read his views on TV. Whatever I said was done in consultation 
          with our organizers, Sardar Bhan Singh and Sardar Abinashi Singh, etc. 
          This was done to normalize the situation. However, all statements were 
          checked and approved by the military authorities. They were constantly 
          saying that there is nothing here, write more statements. HARBIR SINGH: 
          When was the sacred maryada of Sri Harimandir Sahib restored? SINGH 
          SAHIB: September 29, the complex was handed over to us. The interrupted 
          maryada was restored from Oct. 1 onwards. (The first Akhand Path at 
          Har-Ki-Paudi was initiated for Giani Sahib Singh Ji).</font></p>
