        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For thousands of 
          Amritsar's inhabitants, the day begins early. It begins, in fact, the 
          night before at three o'clock or so in the morning, as householders 
          in the city stir with the activity of people preparing for a predawn 
          visit to Darbar Sahib - a routine that hasn't changed for four centuries.</font>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The devout of Amritsar 
          eagerly await this hour each morning with the keen sense of anticipation 
          that comes from knowing they will soon visit the Harimandir.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As they walk through 
          the familiar streets of the old city, their pace quickens in expectation 
          of soon seeing the beloved shrine. Some of them have made this walk 
          at this hour each morning for as long as they can remember.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Outside the main 
          entrance, they take their shoes off, checks them with an attendant and 
          proceed, ... to the complex. At a trough of swiftly running water, they 
          dip their feet to cleanse them. As they pass the flowers stall, some 
          stop to buy garlands of yellow, gold or russet marigolds to carry inside 
          as offerings.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Descending the 
          marble stairs to the parkarma, they behold in the center of the sarowar, 
          the serene and immortal Harimandir Sahib. They gaze at it with awe and 
          with reverence and love the very emotions others before them have experienced 
          for as long as the Harimandir has existed.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> They are transfixed 
          by this first sight of it by its golden facades and domes. The waters 
          around it are still and glassy in the peaceful early morning silence, 
          and capture an almost perfect reflection.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bowing low to make 
          their foreheads touch the cool marble of the parkarma, worshippers pay 
          homage and express thanks for the divine grace that has made their visit 
          possible. Then, as is customary, they turn left to go around the entire 
          parkarma, and to stop at shrines on the way, before finally reaching 
          the Harimandir.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The first shrine 
          along the marble walkway is Dukh Bhanjani Ber. Built around a dujube 
          tree, it marks the spot there, it is said, a dip in the sacred pool 
          miraculously cured a crippled youth. Since many consider their visit 
          to the temple incomplete without bathing at this spot here and enter 
          the water, hoping to shed their afflictions and troubles.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Past Dukh Bhanjani 
          Ber is a raised marble platform which is the Ath Sath Tirath, the Shrine 
          of the Sixty eight Holy Places. If they bathe near it, some believe, 
          their dreams of visiting the 68 holy places of India will be fulfilled.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Further along the 
          parkarma, around the next corner is the shrine of Baba Deep Singh, the 
          legendary old warrior who died at this spot. Ever since pilgrims have 
          paused here to pray to sprinkle rose petals or to lay fresh garlands 
          in his honor.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Such cameos of 
          valor enliven the rich mosaic of a military tradition that continues 
          to this day. Even now, the names of Sikh martyrs and soldiers who die 
          in battle are inscribed on marble plaques embedded in the floor of the 
          parkarma or on the pillars of the adjoining verandahs. Many Indian Army 
          regiments still maintain the tradition of installing commemorative plaques 
          here to honor their war heroes.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As the devout turn 
          the next corner of the parkarma, leading to Akal Takht and Darshani 
          Deorhi, their excitement builds, for soon they will witness, and possibly 
          join in the ceremonies that only those who visit Darbar Sahib at this 
          hour can. These are the rituals that attend the traditional bearing 
          of Guru Granth Sahib from Katha Sahib at Akal Takht where it is kept 
          each night, to Harimandir Sahib, to which it is always returned before 
          five o'clock in the morning.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> About half and 
          hour before Granth Sahib is brought down from Akal Takth, the palki, 
          a gold and silver palanquin, is prepared for it. Attendants replace 
          the cushions and pillows on which Granth Sahib will rest. They lay down 
          fresh sets of silk and brocade coverings and, when everything is ready, 
          they sprinkle delicately scented rose water over all.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As the head priest 
          of the Harimandir appears with Granth Sahib on a cushion on his head, 
          a series of deep, resonant drum beats of the nagara heralds its arrival 
          to the assembled worshippers who, even at this hour, fill the large 
          plaza to capacity. Showering fragrant red, pink and white rose petals, 
          and reciting hymns from the holy scriptures, they make way for the palki's 
          journey to the Harimandir. This passage, through short, sometimes takes 
          up to half an hour while as many worshippers as possible share the honor 
          of carrying it.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The procession 
          solemnly moves across the plaza through Darshani Deorhi, and along the 
          causeway, stopping as it reaches the main door of the Harimandir. The 
          head priest reverently lifts Granth Sahib out of the palke, places it 
          on a silk cushion on his head and enters the holy shrine.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He carries it to 
          its customary place of honor beneath a velvet canopy richly brocaded 
          with silver and gold, and carefully sets it on velvet cushions and silks 
          placed on Manji Sahib.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As the congregation 
          stands in hushed silence, the head priest seats himself in front of 
          Guru Granth Sahib, ceremoniously opens it, and reads aloud the 'Vaq', 
          or the Lord's message, for the day.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The recitation 
          of 'Asa di War', which had been in progress here since a little after 
          3 a.m., had stopped as Granth Sahib was carried in, sung always at this 
          pre-dawn hour, Asa di War also, like all other compositions recited 
          here, is taken from Granth Sahib.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After the 'Vaq' 
          is read, the singing of 'Asa di War' continues. As it ends, the entire 
          congregation and the servitors of the temple stand up for the Ardas, 
          a prayer that is recited at the conclusion of each service. After the 
          Ardas, the Shabad Kirtan, the vocal and musical rendition of sacred 
          verses, is resumed. Shabads will be sung throughout the day and late 
          into the evening by a succession of ragis.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The early morning 
          worshippers now step out of the Harmandir, walk on the inner parkarma 
          that encircles it, and stop on its southern side at the Har ki Pauri. 
          Here, marble steps descend into the sarowar so that visitors may cup 
          the water of the sacred pool in their hands and sprinkle it on their 
          heads. Some take a small sip of it as well. Tradition has it that Guru 
          Arjan himself gave this place its name.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Continuing around 
          the Harmandir, on the inner parkarma, the devotees once more bow in 
          the direction of Granth Sahib, then make their way back over the causeway, 
          through Darshani Deorhi and on to the main parkarma.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As they proceed 
          along the parkarma, towards the stairs by which they had entered, some 
          pause by Ber Baba Buddha, popularly represented, from those who have 
          already made the better part of their journey through life, to the newlyweds 
          who have come to seek blessings for the life that lies ahead - brides 
          in scarlet and gold wedding finery, grooms in crisply tied pink or red 
          turbans.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> People are spread 
          out everywhere. Some are in the Harmandir listening to the Shabad kirtan 
          on the ground floor, others are absorbed in the words of the akhand 
          path in the quiet of its upper floors. Some visit Akal Takht where the 
          swords and personal weapons of Guru Gobind Singh are enshrined.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many join the line 
          in front of the special kitchen where Karah parshad is prepared. They 
          make a donation of money for this sacramental food and carry it into 
          the Harimandir. They give it to the attendants stationed at the door 
          specially to receive it. The attendants, in turn pass it on with Got's 
          blessing to those leaving the sanctum.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Some devotees sit 
          in quiet contemplation in the Shrine of Baba Atal, built to honor Guru 
          Hargobind's remarkably gifted son who died young or in the shrine built 
          in Guru Tegh Bahadur's memory. Since voluntary service is the very essence 
          of Sikhism, a continuous stream of visitors makes its way to the Guru 
          Ram Dass langar, to help prepare the food that will be served to the 
          thousands who eat there daily.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Occasionally visitors 
          go on brief forays into the winding bazaars around Darbar Sahib, drawn 
          to them by the endless variety of goods on display, the prospect of 
          good-natured bargaining, the banter between the customers and the shopkeepers, 
          and the stimulation of the many colors, textures and sounds that only 
          a traditional Indian bazaar offers.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As the sun sets 
          and the time for evening prayers nears, there is a perceptible change 
          in the nature of the people who now enter the Harimandir. These devotees 
          come to sit and listen in rapt attention to the evening recitations, 
          and to enjoy the beauty of the verses and the rags in which these prayers 
          are rendered. Just as in the morning prayers began with 'Asa di War', 
          in the evening prayers end with the Rahras, the arti, and the shabad 
          kirtan, concluding with Ardas at 9:45 pm.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When the prayers 
          end, Guru Granth Sahib reverently closed, wrapped in fresh layers of 
          rich silk and muslin, and ceremonially carried to the palki waiting 
          outside. As in the morning, so also now, the palki is shouldered by 
          devout Sikhs and taken to Kotha Sahib where Granth Sahib will rest for 
          the night.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The massive silver 
          and rosewood doors of Darshani Deorhi are shut and a group of volunteers 
          inside the Harimandir start the ritual cleansing of the shrine with 
          milk and water in preparation for the next day. In the few hours the 
          doors of Darshani Deorhi will once again be opened to worshippers, and 
          the Harmindir will be ready to receive them so that they can welcome 
          the arrival of Guru Granth Sahib and seek spiritual guidance for another 
          day.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Seeing the glow 
          of the lamps and their myriad reflections in the pool, bearing the melodic 
          chanting of hymns, tossing handfuls of rose petals before the procession 
          of Granth Sahib, and feeling the intensity of the love and reverence 
          that attend each ritual are experiences that will always be remembered.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Day after day, 
          the Harimandir, the abiding symbol of the Sikh faith, continues to inspire 
          and uplift those thousands who come to it. It is, in a sense, the heart 
          of the Sikh, for wherever beats a Sikh heart, there throbs the sentiment 
          of undying devotion for this holiest of all Sikh shrines.</font> </p>
