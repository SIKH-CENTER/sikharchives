          the bard out of work, the Lord has applied to His service. In the very 
          beginning He gave me the order to sing His praises night and day. The 
          Master summoned the minstrel to His True Court. He clothed me with the 
          robe of His true honour and eulogy. Since then the True Name had become 
          my ambrosial food. They, who under the Guru's instruction, eat this 
          food to their satisfaction, obtain peace. By singing the Guru's hymns, 
          I, the minstrel spread the Lord's glory. Nanak, by praising the True 
          Name I have obtained the perfect Lord." (Guru Nanak, Pauri, pg. 150)</font></i> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The founder of 
              the Sikh religion, Guru Nanak was born on April 15, 1469 in the Western 
              Punjab village of Talwandi. He was born to a simple Hindu family. His 
              father Mehta Kalian Das was an accountant in the employment of the local 
              Muslim authorities. From an early age Guru Nanak made friends with both 
              Hindu and Muslim children and was very inquisitive about the meaning 
              of life. At the age of six he was sent to the village school teacher 
              for schooling in reading and writing in Hindi and mathematics. He was 
              then schooled in the study of Muslim literature and learned Persian 
              and Arabic. He was an unusually gifted child who learned quickly and 
              often question his teachers. At age 13 it was time for Guru Nanak to 
              be invested with the sacred thread according to the traditional Hindu 
              custom. At the ceremony which was attended by family and friends and 
              to the disappointment of his family Guru Nanak refused to accept the 
              sacred cotton thread from the Hindu priest. He sang the following poem;</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Let mercy be the 
                cotton, contentment the thread, Continence the knot and truth the twist. 
                O priest! If you have such a thread, Do give it to me. It'll not wear 
                out, nor get soiled, nor burnt, nor lost. Says Nanak, blessed are those 
                who go about wearing such a thread" (Rag Asa)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As a young man 
                  herding the family cattle, Guru Nanak would spend long hours absorbed 
                  in meditation and in religious discussions with Muslim and Hindu holy 
                  men who lived in the forests surrounding the village. Thinking that 
                  if bound in marriage Guru Nanak might start taking interest in household 
                  affairs a suitable match was found for him. At age 16 he was married 
                  to Sulakhani daughter of a pious merchant. Guru Nanak did not object 
                  as he felt that married life did not conflict with spiritual pursuits. 
                  Guru Nanak was happily married, he loved his wife and eventually had 
                  two sons Sri Chand in 1494 and Lakshmi Chand three years later. Now 
                  that he had a family of his own Guru Nanak was persuaded by his parents 
                  to take a job as an accountant in charge of the stores of the Muslim 
                  governor of Sultanpur Daulat Khan Lodi. Guru Nanak agreed and was joined 
                  by his family and an old Muslim childhood friend Mardana, a musician 
                  by profession. Guru Nanak would work during the days, but early in the 
                  mornings and late at nights, he would meditate and sing hymns accompanied 
                  by Mardana on the rabab ( a string instrument). These sessions attracted 
                  a lot of attention and many people started joining the two. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Early one morning 
                    accompanied by Mardana, Guru Nanak went to the river Bain for his bath. 
                    After plunging into the river, Guru Nanak did not surface and it was 
                    reported that he must have drowned. The villagers searched everywhere, 
                    but their was no trace of him. Guru Nanak was in holy communion with 
                    God. The Lord God revealed himself to Guru Nanak and enlightened him. 
                    In praise of the Lord, Guru Nanak uttered; </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is but One 
                      God, His name is Truth, He is the Creator, He fears none, he is without 
                      hate, He never dies, He is beyond the cycle of births and death, He 
                      is self illuminated, He is realized by the kindness of the True Guru. 
                      He was True in the beginning, He was True when the ages commenced and 
                      has ever been True, He is also True now." (Japji)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> These words are 
                        enshrined at the beginning of the Sikh Holy Scriptures, the Guru Granth 
                        Sahib. Guru Nanak did not believe in a Trinity of Gods, or the belief 
                        that God can be born into human form.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After three days 
                          Guru Nanak appeared at the same spot from where he had disappeared. 
                          He was no longer the same person he had been, there was a divine light 
                          in his eyes and his face was resplendent. He remained in a trance and 
                          said nothing. He gave up his job and distributed all of his belongings 
                          to the poor. When he finally broke his silence he uttered "There is 
                          no Hindu, no Muslim". Daulat Khan asked what he meant when he said to 
                          Guru Nanak, "Perhaps the Hindus were no longer Hindus but the Muslims 
                          remain devout to their faith." Guru Nanak replied,</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Let God's grace 
                            be the mosque, and devotion the prayer mat. Let the Quran be the good 
                            conduct. Let modesty be compassion, good manners fasting, you should 
                            be a Muslim the like of this. Let good deeds be your Kaaba and truth 
                            be your mentor. Your Kalma be your creed and prayer, God would then 
                            vindicate your honour." (Majh)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Nanak was 
                              thirty years old at this time in 1499. The next stage of his life began 
                              with extensive travels to spread the message of God. Accompanied by 
                              his Muslim rabab player Mardana for company, Guru Nanak undertook long 
                              journeys to convey his message to the people in the form of musical 
                              hymns. Guru Nanak choose this medium to propagate his message because 
                              it was easily understood by the population of the time. Wherever he 
                              traveled he used the local language to convey his message to the people. 
                              He traveled throughout the Indian Subcontinent and further east, west, 
                              and north to spread his mission. Wherever he went he set up local cells 
                              called manjis, where his followers could gather to recite hymns and 
                              meditate.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Once when Guru 
                                Nanak came to the small town of Saidpur in West Punjab he choose to 
                                stay there with Lalo, a low caste carpenter. At the same time the local 
                                chief of the town Malik Bhago, who was quite wealthy and a very proud 
                                man was holding a feast to which all holy men were invited. When Malik 
                                Bhago found out that Guru Nanak would not attend his feast but instead 
                                partook of the simple fare of his host Lalo, he was quite angry and 
                                had the Guru brought to him for questioning. When asked why he didn't 
                                join in the feast, the Guru sent for the meal served by Malik Bhago 
                                and also some of the simple meal served by Lalo. Holding these in separate 
                                hands he squeezed them, blood appeared out of the rich food of Malik 
                                Bhago, while milk oozed out of Lalos simple fare. Malik Bhago was put 
                                to shame and realized that his riches had been amassed by exploiting 
                                the poor, while what Lalo offered was the milk of hard earned honest 
                                work.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another time while 
                                  camped out at a town during the rainy season, several devotees would 
                                  come to the Guru on a regular basis. One of them while on the way to 
                                  see the Guru, came across a prostitute and was allured by her. Thereafter 
                                  he would leave home on the pretext of going to see the Guru, but instead 
                                  visited the prostitute. A few days later his friend who daily came to 
                                  pay homage to the Guru was pricked by a thorn, while his neighbor, who 
                                  visited the prostitute, found a gold coin in the street. The incident 
                                  bewildered the Guru's devotee who came every day religiously. He mentioned 
                                  it in the morning prayer meeting where Guru Nanak heard it and was amused. 
                                  He told the Sikh;</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Your friend was 
                                    destined to come across a treasure but due to his evil ways, it has 
                                    been reduced to a single coin. While on the account of your past karma 
                                    you were to have been impaled with a stake, but having reformed yourself, 
                                    you have been let off with the mere prick of a thorn." (Janamsakhi)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When the Guru visited 
                                      Kurukshetra in Haryana, a big fair was being held at the holy tank to 
                                      celebrate the solar eclipse. There were a large number of pilgrims all 
                                      over the country. On his arrival at the fair, Guru Nanak had Mardana 
                                      cook them a meat dish of a deer presented to them by one of his followers. 
                                      Upon finding that meat was being cooked on the holy premises, a large 
                                      angry crowd gathered in anger to attack the Guru for what they thought 
                                      amounted to sacrilege <i>(Bhai Mani Singh, Gyan Ratnavali, pg. 123)</i>. 
                                      Upon hearing the angry crowd Guru Nanak responded;</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Only fools argue 
                                        whether to eat meat or not. They don't understand truth nor do they 
                                        meditate on it. Who can define what is meat and what is plant? Who knows 
                                        where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non- vegetarian?" (Malhar)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When Guru Nanak 
                                          stopped at Hardwar a pilgrimage center on the Ganges river he found 
                                          a large gathering of devotees. They were taking ritual baths in the 
                                          holy river and offering water to the sun. When the Guru asked "Why do 
                                          you throw water like that?" The pilgrims replied that they were offering 
                                          it to their ancestors. Guru Nanak upon hearing this started throwing 
                                          water in the opposite direction towards the west. When the pilgrims 
                                          asked him what he was doing?. Guru Nanak replied "I am sending water 
                                          to my farm which is dry". They asked, "How will water reach you crops 
                                          so far away?". Guru Nanak replied, "If your water can reach your ancestors 
                                          in the region of the sun, why can't mine reach my fields a short distance 
                                          away?" The pilgrims realized their folly and fell at the Gurus feet.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On an eastern journey 
                                            Guru Nanak visited Gorakhmata where he discussed the true meaning of 
                                            asceticism with some yogis;</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Asceticism doesn't 
                                              lie in ascetic robes, or in walking staff, nor in the ashes. Asceticism 
                                              doesn't lie in the earring, nor in the shaven head, nor blowing a conch. 
                                              Asceticism lies in remaining pure amidst impurities. Asceticism doesn't 
                                              lie in mere words; He is an ascetic who treats everyone alike. Asceticism 
                                              doesn't lie in visiting burial places, It lies not in wandering about, 
                                              nor in bathing at places of pilgrimage. Asceticism is to remain pure 
                                              amidst impurities. (Suhi)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After his first 
                                                long journey, Guru Nanak returned home after twelve years of propagating 
                                                his message. He then set out on a second journey traveling as far south 
                                                as Sri Lanka. On his return north he founded a settlement known as Kartharpur 
                                                (the Abode of God) on the western banks of the Ravi river. Guru Nanak 
                                                would one day settle down here in his old age. It was also here that 
                                                he met a young devotee who would later go on to serve five of the following 
                                                Gurus, Baba Buddha (the revered old one). On his third great journey 
                                                Guru Nanak traveled as far north as Tibet. Wherever Guru Nanak traveled 
                                                he always wore a combination of styles worn by Hindu and Muslim holy 
                                                men and was always asked whether he was a Hindu or Muslim. Guru Nanak 
                                                visited Sheikh Ibrahim the muslim successor of Baba Farid the great 
                                                Sufi dervish of the twelfth century at Ajodhan. When asked by Ibrahim 
                                                which of the two religions was the true way to attain God, Guru Nanak 
                                                replied; "If there is one God, then there is only His way to attain 
                                                Him, not another. One must follow that way and reject the other. Worship 
                                                not him who is born only to die, but Him who is eternal and is contained 
                                                in the whole universe."</font>

                                                  at Mecca, Guru Nanak fell asleep with his feet pointing towards the

                                                  the Guru, saying, "How dare you turn your feet towards the house of 
                                                  God". At this Guru Nanak woke up and said, "Good man, I am weary after 
                                                  a long journey. Kindly turn my feet in the direction where God is not."
