          the city of Paunta. On the banks of the Kalindri, I refreshed and amused

All of the Sikh cronicles record the fact that during the ceremony of 
        initiating the first five Sikhs into the Khalsa brotherhood Guru Gobind 
        Singh asked for volunteers who would be willing to give their heads. He 
        took each volunteer into the tent and a loud thud was heard and blood 
        trickled out of the tent. Guru Gobind Singh then emerged from the tent 
        with his sword dripping with blood and asked for the next volunteer. Eventually 
        Guru Gobind Singh emerged from the tent with the five beloved ones alive. 
        He pulled back the covers of the tent and revealed to the thousands gathered 
        that he had really slaughtered five goats with his sword and not the five 
        beloved ones. </font>

At Kurukshetra, a great centre of Hindu pilgrimage, where a big fair was 
        being held on the occasion of the solar eclipse. A follower of the Guru 
        offered him deer meat to eat. The Guru who had never made any distinction 
        between one kind of food and another and took whatever was offered to 
        him, did not refuse the courtesies of his devotee. And he allowed him 
        to roast it for his food. </font>

          It first occurs in Bhai Mani Singh's Gyan Ratnavali (pg. 123) which 
          mentions Nanak having been engaged in debate with a Pandit, called Nanau 
          Chand. The deer-meat was, according to this version, brought to him 
          as an offering by a Prince and his consort, who having been dispossessed 
          of their realm, came to him for a blessing. In the dialogue that followed 
          with the Pandit, he is not only convinced of Nanak's logic, but persuades 
          also the fellow Brahmins, basing his argument on the Veda, the Puranas 
          and even the Quran, saying that even the Hindu gods could be propieated 
          since the earliest times only through yagnas in which meat was invariably 
          served, and that it has been the dharma of the Kashatriya Kings since 
          ages to hunt. </font> </p>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Guru Angad and Guru 
        Amar Das Eating Meat</b></font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Sikh Religion, 
          Volume II by Max Arthur Macauliffe</b><br>
          One day the Guru had a meat dinner prepared. Amar Das said, &quot;If the 
          Guru is a searcher of hearts, he must know that I am a Vaishnav and 
          do not touch flesh&quot;. The Guru (Guru Angad), knowing this, ordered that 
          dal should be served him. Amar Das then reflected, &quot;The Guru knoweth 
          that meat is forbidden me, so he hath ordered that dal be served me 
          instead.&quot; Amar Das then rapidly arrived at the conclusion that any disciple, 
          whose practice differed from that of the Guru, must inevitably fail. 
          He therefore told the cook that if the Guru were kind enough to give 
          him meat, he would partake of it. The Guru, on hearing this, knew that 
          superstition was departing from Amar Das's heart, and he handed him 
          his own dish. When Amar Das had partaken of it, he for the first time 
          felt peace of mind, and as he became further absorbed in his attentions 
          and devotion to the Guru, celestial light dawned on his heart. Thus 
          did he break with the strictest tenet of Vaishnavism and become a follower 
          of the Guru. One day the Guru, in order to further remove Amar Das's 
          prejudices, thus began to instruct him: &quot;The meats it is proper to abstain 
          from are these - Other's wealth, other's wives, slander, envy, covetousness 
          and pride. If any one abstaining from meat is proud on the subject and 
          says, 'I never touch meat,' let him consider that the infant sucks nipples 
          of flesh, that the married man takes home with him a vessel of flesh.&quot; 
          Guru Angad then repeated and expounded Guru Nanak's sloks on the subject. 
          He also related to Amar Das the story of Duni Chand and his father, 
          giving in the Life of Guru Nanak. &quot;If you think of it,&quot; continued the 
          Guru, &quot;there is life in everything, even in fruits and flowers, so say 
          nothing of flesh; but whatever thou eatest, eat remembering God, and 
          it shall be profitable to thee. Whatever cometh to thee without hurting 
          a fellow creature is nectar, and whatever thou recievest by giving pain 
          is poison. To shatter another's hopes, to calumniate others, and to 
          misappropriate their property is worse than to eat meat.&quot;</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Macauliffe collaborated 
          with the most learned Sikhs of his time when he wrote this over 100 
          years ago. The exact written source of this account is unknown.</font> </p>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Guru Hargobind Eating 
        Meat</b></font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mohsin Fani, 
          Dabistan-e-Mazahib</b><br>
          Mohsin Fani was a historian, traveller and mystic who was born around 
          1615 in Persia. During the lifetime of Guru Hargobind he migrated to 
          India and studied the religions of India. He became very good friends 
          with Guru Hargobind and spent a great deal of time with the Guru upto 
          the Gurus death in 1644. In between 1645 and 1654 he produced his great 
          work 'Dabistan-e-Mazahib' meaning 'the schools of thought of various 
          religions'. This book provides the most accurate account of the life 
          of Guru Hargobind and the Sikhs at that time. Mohsin Fani writes:</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Guru believes 
          in one God. His followers put not their faith in idol-worship. They 
          never pray or practice austerities like the Hindus. They believe not 
          in their incarnations, or places of pilgrimage nor the Sanskrit language 
          which the Hindus deem to be the language of gods. They believe that 
          all the Gurus are the same as Nanak. The Sikhs are not restricted in 
          the matter of eating or drinking. When Partap Mall Giani saw a Hindu 
          boy who had a mind to embrace Islam, he said, 'Why do you become a Muhammadan? 
          If you have an inclination to eat everything, you may become a Sikh 
          of the Guru and eat whatever you like.&quot;</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Some use a quote 
          from Mohsin Fani to prove that Guru Nanak and Guru Arjan did not 
          allow Sikhs to eat meat. Since he only emigrated to India during the 
          lifetime of Guru Hargobind, his information about Guru Nanak and Guru 
          Arjan cannot be considered an eyewitness account of his. Also vegetarian 
          proponents usually only give a partial quote, the full quote of his 
          is:</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nanak himself 
          abstained from animal food and the prudent Arjan endevoured to add to 
          his saintly merit and influence by a similar moderation; but the adventurous 
          Hargobind became a hunter and an eater of flesh, and his disciples imitated 
          him in these robust practices.&quot;</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Gokul Chand 
          Narang</b><br>
          Another contemporary of the Guru, Gokul Chand Narang provides the following 
          eyewitness acount:</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Hargobind began 
          to devote most of his time to wrestling, riding, tent-pegging and hunting 
          the tigers and the boars. With the change of aims the occupation changed, 
          and with the change in the occupation came a change in tastes and even 
          diet. Animal food was not only sanctioned but encouraged.&quot;</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> An eyewitness account 
          of the siege of the Khalsa army at Gurdaspur and how the Khalsa soldiers 
          and Banda Singh Bahadur bravely held out against the Mughal army for 
          eight months is provided below:</font> </p>

          Muntakhabul-Lubab, pg. 723</b><br>
  &quot;The Sikhs were not strict observers of cast, they slaughtered oxen 
          and other animals and not having any firewood, ate the flesh raw. Many 
          died of dysentry and privation... when all the grass was gone, they 
          gathered leaves from trees. When these were consumed, they stripped 
          the bark and broke off the small shoots, dried them, ground them down 
          and used them instead of flour, thus keeping body and soul together. 
          They also collected the bones of animals and used them in the same way. 
          Some assert that they saw a few of the Sikhs cut flesh from their own 
          thights, roast it, and eat it.</font> </p>
