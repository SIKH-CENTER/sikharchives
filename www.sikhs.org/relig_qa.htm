<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recitation of religious 
          books, penance, religious discussions and all meditations,<br>
The exposition of six schools of philosophy and Hindu ceremonial books,<br>
The practice of yoga and the performance of religious rituals,<br>
The abandonment of everything and wandering in forests,<br>
The performance of many efforts of various types,<br>
Alms giving, oblation to fire and bestowal of many jewels,<br>
Cutting off the body into small pieces and making them an offering of 
          fire,<br>
The performance of fastings and vows of many varieties,<br>
All these are not equal to the contemplation of Lord's Name.<br>
<i>(Guru Arjan, Ashtpadi, pg. 205)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If we think of 
  the suitable time and moment, at what time, then can the worship of 
  Lord be performed? By remaining, night and day, imbued with God's Name, 
  the true person has true reputation. When one forgets the Beloved even 
  for a moment, what sort of devotional service is that?&quot; <i>(Guru Amar 
    Das, Sri Rag, pg. 35)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Say not that the 
  Vedas and Muslim books are false. False is he, who reflects not on them.&quot; <i>(Bhagat Kabir, Parbhati, pg. 1350)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Make thy mind 
  thy Mecca and make thy body thy temple of worship. This soul, the speaker 
  is the Supreme Guru. O Maulvi, then utter thou the call to prayer. The 
  one body mosque has ten doors. Slay thou thy wrath, doubt and malice 
  and consume thine five demons. Thus thou shalt be blest with contentment. 
  The Hindus and the Muslims have the same One Lord. For man, what can 
  the Maulvi do and what can the Sheikh do?&quot; <i>(Bhagat Kabir, Bhairo, 
    pg. 1158)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Hindu is blind 
  and the Muslim is one-eyed. The Lord divine is the wiser of the two. 
  The Hindu worships at the temple and the Muslim at the mosque. Namdev 
  serves that Lord, who has neither a temple nor a mosque.&quot; <i>(Bhagat 
    Namdev, Gond, pg. 875)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;All the Vedas, 
  the religious books of the Muslims, the Simirtis and Shashtras, by reading 
  these, salvation is not obtained. He who by Guru's instruction utters 
  the one Name; He gathers the pure glory.&quot; <i>(Guru Arjan, Suhi, 
    pg. 747)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;One man shaves 
  off and calls himself a sanyasin, another passes for a yogi or a celibate. 
  One calls himself a Hindu, another a Turk, one a Shia, another a Sunni, 
  but know ye, men all over are the same. He alone is the Creator of both 
  Hindus and Muslims, the Compassionate One, the Allah, our great Giver: 
  nay, know not another, for there is not another. So serve they all the 
  One alone: for He the One is the only God of us all: it is His Form, 
  His Light that is diffused in all.&quot; <i>(Guru Gobind Singh, Kabitas 71-90, 
    Akal Ustati)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A Muslim understands 
  the Muslim way of life and a Hindu the Vedas and Puranas. To instruct 
  his mind, man ought to study Divine Knowledge to some extent. I know 
  only the One Lord, who is the source of everything. I believe not in 
  him, whom the Lord writes (creates) and erases (destroys). If someone 
  sees the One Lord, he perishes not by beholding Him.&quot; <i>(Bhagat Kabir, 
    Gauri, pg. 340)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If God abides 
  only in the mosque, then to whom else does the rest of the country belong? 
  According to Hindus the Lord's Name, abides in the idol, but, I see 
  not truth in both. O my Lord God, I live by Thy Name. O my Master, show 
  Thou mercy unto me. The God of Hindus dwells in the southern land and 
  the God of Muslims has His seat in the west. Search thou in thy mind, 
  yea, search thou in the heart of thy mind, for this alone is the only 
  abode and seat of thy God.&quot; <i>(Bhagat Kabir, Parbhati, pg. 1349)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Muslims praise 
  the Islamic law and they read and reflect upon it. According to them 
  the Lord's servants are only they, who fall in captivity (of orthodoxy 
  of Islamic law) to see His sight. The Hindus praise the Praiseworthy 
  God, when they see in many beauteous form. They bathe at holy places, 
  make flower offerings and spread the perfume of eagle-wood before idols. 
  The yogis that there are meditate on the Absolute Lord and name the 
  Creator as Unseen....Like the above, depart after eating here, what 
  they had. Have they thus done any good deeds?&quot; <i>(Guru Nanak, Slok, 
    pg. 465)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The temple or 
  the mosque are the same, the Hindu worship or the Musalman prayer are 
  the same; all men are the same; it is through error they appear different. 
  Deities, demons, Yakshas, heavenly singers, Musalmans and Hindus adopt 
  the customary dress of their different countries. All men have the same 
  eyes, the same ears, the same body, the same build, a compound of earth, 
  air, fire, and water. All and Abhekh are the same, the Purans and the 
  Quran are the same; they are all alike; it is the one God who created 
  all. The Hindu God and the Muhammadan God are the same; let no man even 
  by mistake suppose there is a difference.&quot; <i>(Guru Gobind Singh, Akal 
    Ustat, pg. 275)</i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i></i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i></i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font> </p>
