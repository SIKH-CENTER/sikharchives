          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A concise history of the Sikhs, Ardas is 
            used as the common prayer. It is recited whenever starting or ending 
            any reading of Sri Guru Granth Sahib or any other important task. The 
            first part of it appears as a prologue to Chandi Di Var written by Guru 
            Gobind Singh invoking blessings of God and the Gurus. The remainder 
            of the bulk was incorporated by the great Sikh scholar Bhai Mani Singh. 
            Further additions have been added over time taking into account major 
          events affecting Sikhs.</font></p>
