        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kirpan (ceremonial 
          sword) worn by followers of the Sikh religion sometimes raises questions 
          or concerns among people who are unfamiliar with the religion or it's 
          tenants. The Kirpan is an ingrained part of the Sikh religion and is 
          in many ways it's religious symbolism is similar to the Cross in Christianity. 
          Just as a Cross is worn be devout Christians, baptized Sikhs are required 
          to wear the Kirpan. The Kirpan is no more symbolic a weapons than the 
          Christian Cross is symbolic of a torture instrument. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikhism is a 500 
          year old religion with over 20 million followers worldwide. It is ranked 
          as a major world religion with even more followers than Judaism for 
          example. Guru Nanak (1469-1539) who preached a message of One God for 
          all of humanity founded it. He stressed loving devotion to God and universal 
          principles of morality, truth and honest living and full equality of 
          mankind irrespective of race, caste, creed or sex. Nine successive prophets 
          succeeded Guru Nanak, the line ending with Guru Gobind Singh in 1708. 
          Sikhism is not a new-age movement, cult or sect, but a well established 
          and respected major world religion with it's own distinctive beliefs 
          and practices. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kirpan has been 
          an integral part of the Sikh religion since it's early inception and 
          has a very sacred religious symbolism for Sikhs. To suggest that it 
          is a `dagger', or a `weapon' or merely a cultural symbol is both misleading 
          and offensive to Sikhs. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To Sikhs the Kirpan 
          is religiously symbolic of their spirituality and the constant struggle 
          of good and morality over the forces of evil and injustice, both on 
          a individual as well as social level. The usage of the Kirpan in this 
          religious context is clearly indicated in the Sikh holy scriptures (Sri 
          Guru Granth Sahib) and wearing it is ment to inspire a Sikh in their 
          daily life; </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"To forsake pride, 
          emotional attachment, and the sense of `mine and yours', is the path 
          of the double-edged sword." (Guru Arjan Dev, Devgandhari, pg. 534) </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"From the Guru, 
          I have obtained the supremely powerful sword of spiritual wisdom. I 
          have cut down the fortress of duality and doubt, attachment, greed and 
          egotism. The Name of the Lord abides within my mind; I contemplate the 
          Word of the Guru's hymns." (Guru Ram Das, Maru, pg. 1087) </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru Gobind Singh 
          introduced the metaphor of the Kirpan to refer to God and his qualities; 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"O Sword, O Conqueror 
          of continents, O Vanquisher of the hosts of evil, O Embellisher of the 
          brave in the field of battle. Thy Arms are unbreakable, Thy Light refulgent, 
          Thy Glory and Splendor dazzle like the sun. O Happiness of the holy, 
          O Crusher of evil intent, O Subduer of sin, I seek Thy refuge." (Guru 
          Gobind Singh, Vachitra Natak, Chapter I) </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The practice of 
          Sikhs carrying the Kirpan as a religious symbol can be traced back to 
          the lifetime of the sixth Sikh prophet, Guru Hargobind (1595-1644). 
          Guru Hargobind regularly carried two swords, symbolic of a Sikhs spiritual 
          as well as temporal obligations. Guru Hargobind introduced Sikhs to 
          the concept of being a Sant-Sipahi (Saint-Soldier). A Sikh must be a 
          Saint always meditating and remembering God. At the same time a Sikh 
          is also expected to be a soldier, a person taking part in their social 
          responsibilities to their family and community. Following the path of 
          law, order and morality as laid out by the Sikh Gurus. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was Guru Gobind 
          Singh, the final living Sikh prophet who formally instituted the mandatory 
          requirement for all baptized Sikhs to wear the Kirpan at all times. 
          He instituted the current Sikh baptism ceremony in 1699 which is referred 
          to as the `baptism of the sword' (khanda di pahul). During the ceremony 
          sugar crystals and water are stirred in a steel bowl with a Kirpan before 
          the initiate drinks the mixture. During the baptism ceremony the initiate 
          is instructed in the duties and obligations of becoming a Khalsa (one 
          belonging to the Divine). The Khalsa is expected to live by the high 
          moral standards of the Sikh Gurus at all times which includes such things 
          as abstaining from smoking, drinking and other intoxicants, performing 
          daily prayers and always maintaining the distinctive physical symbols 
          of Sikhism on their person. The most noticeable of these being uncut 
          hair and carrying the Kirpan. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This injunction 
          appears in the Rehat Maryada (The Official Sikh Code of Conduct); "Have, 
          on your person, all the time, the five K's: The Keshas (unshorn hair), 
          the Kirpan (sheathed sword), the Kachhehra (drawers like garment), the 
          Kanga (comb), the Karha (steel bracelet)." (Rehat Maryada, Ceremony of 
          Baptism or Initiation, Section 6, Chapter XIII, Article XXIV, paragraph 
          (p)) </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rehat Maryada 
          does not specify the length of the Kirpan or how it is to be worn by 
          the devotee. Kirpans can be anywhere from 3 foot swords carried by Sikhs 
          on religious festivals, marriages and parades, to a few inches in length. 
          They can either be worn over ones clothing or under the clothing. The 
          Kirpan is usually kept sheathed except when it is withdrawn from it's 
          casing on such occasions as consecration of the ceremonial sweet pudding 
          distributed during religious ceremonies. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To suggest that 
          the Kirpan is a weapon is both incorrect and misleading. If it was instituted 
          as a weapon, then would Sikhs not be expected to carry guns today? Guns 
          were in common use during the time of Guru Gobind Singh. If the Kirpan 
          was purely a soldiers weapon for Sikhs, than why do they not also carry 
          a shield as well or other armour? Why do modern armies and soldiers 
          carry swords on ceremonial occasions? Because it is symbolic of their 
          military tradition and heritage. In the same way Sikhs carry the Kirpan 
          at all times because it is symbolic of their religious tradition and 
          heritage. </font>
