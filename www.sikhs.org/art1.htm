        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru Nanak's concept 
          and vision of the Supreme Being is embodied in terse terms in the Sikh 
          Fundamental Creed, Mool Mantra, literally meaning the Root Formula. 
          Because of its importance as a basic theological declaration around 
          which revolves the whole Sikh philosophical thought, it is most appropriately 
          placed in the very beginning of the Sikh scripture, the Guru Granth 
          Sahib. It affirms in unequivocal terms Guru Nanak's uncompromising belief 
          in monotheism. In the original the text read as:</font>
        <p> 
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Ek Onkar Satnam 
          Karta Purush Nirbhau Virvair Akal Murat, Ajuni Saibhang Gurprasad(i)"</i></font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The English rendering 
          would approximate to:</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There is One and 
          only One God who is transcendent as well as immanent. True and Eternal 
          Name. Creator and Person. Without Fear and without Enmity. Timeless 
          Form, Unborn, Self-existent. Realized by Divine Grace.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Besides Mool Mantra 
          there is another term Bij Mantra (Seed Formula) which is occurs in Guru 
          Arjun's composition 'Sukhmani' (Pearl of Peace). The original text where 
          it appears runs as:</font>
        <p> 
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Bij Manter sarab 
          ko Gyan. Chahu Varona meh japey kou Naam."</i></font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It's English version 
          is:</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> All can be enlightened 
          with Bij Mantra. Anyone from four castes can meditate on it.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It may be noted 
          that this is entirely in contrast to the traditions of the caste ridden 
          Hindu society wherein the lower castes are not entitled to benefit from 
          enlightenment of Mantras for meditation, etc.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The term Bij Mantra 
          signifies any word or phrase out of which develops a prayer meant to 
          be meditated upon or chanted to invoke Divine blessing. Almost all the 
          Sikh scholars and theologians are unanimous in recognizing Ek-Onkar 
          as the Bij Mantra out of which has emanated Guru Nanak's vision of the 
          Supreme Being in the form of Mool Mantra. That is why it stands majestically 
          at the head of the Mool Mantra and forms its integral part.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It is constituted 
          of two components - Ek and Onkar. Ek means one, and is written as a 
          numerical figure '1'. Onkar stands for the Primal mystical Divine Name 
          of God referred to as Brahma in the Vedic literature. In order to grasp 
          fully the underlying spiritual significance and meaning of Ek-Onkar 
          each of its components needs to be studied in depth, beginning with 
          Onkar.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The root of Onkar 
          is traceable to the Hindu sacred syllable Om, also written as Aum. Historically, 
          in the beginning, Om was used as a reply of approval or consent. It 
          is equivalent to the English word 'Amen' uttered at the end of a Christian 
          prayer, meaning 'so be it'.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At a later stage, 
          with the evolution of Indian philosophic thought, the sages of Upanishads 
          pronounced it as an adequate symbol of the Absolute Transcendent Reality, 
          Brahma. It is considered as the unity of all sound to which all matters 
          and energy are reduced in their primordial form, hence fit as a symbol 
          for Atman (soul) or Brahma, the Supreme Being, which is the unity of 
          all existence. These - and possibly some other - considerations led 
          the Vedic sages to accord to Om the highest Divine reverence and worship. 
          As a very sacred and powerful Mantra it forms part of daily worship 
          and meditation by Hindu devotees. It is treated as the holiest symbol 
          of Divinity calling it Nada Brahma or Shabda Brahma in the form of sound. 
          Its nearest equivalent in the West is Logos or the 'Word'. St. John's 
          Gospel expounds it thus:</font>
        <p> 
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"in the beginning 
          was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God." The Word 
          was the true light that enlightens all men!</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Written in original, 
          it is composed of three letters of Sanskrit alphabet, corresponding 
          to A U M of English alphabet. According to the polytheistic tradition 
          of Hinduism it also represented the Hindu Trinity, each letter standing 
          for one of the deities, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This, is obviously, 
          was not acceptable to Guru Nanak whose concept of God was based on unalloyed 
          monotheism. His was One and Only One Supreme Being, an Indivisible Entity. 
          This belief in the unity of God he has re-iterated in various ways in 
          his other compositions as well. At one place he emphatically affirms, 
          Sahib mera Eko hai, Eko hai Bhai, eko hai.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In English:</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'My Master is One, 
          One only, Oh Brother, He is Sole.'</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> So Guru Nanak's 
          revealed Scripture place numerical figure '1' before Onkar thus enhancing 
          his firm conviction in the unity of God. Its main importance and underlying 
          significance lies in the fact that one is not represented by 'one' in 
          words, but by a numerical figure '1'; thus completely eliminating any 
          possibility of words being given different meaning. It was Guru Nanak's 
          own inspired vision that transformed AUM into Ek-Onkar representing 
          the Supreme Being, the Sole Absolute Eternal Reality which, while manifesting 
          itself in multiplicity as Onkar, is still in its essence 'Sole and Absolute'; 
          Transcendent as well as Immanent. Impersonal is also Personal in Ek-Onkar.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> By the large, Sikhs 
          worship 'Waheguru' as God's name for constant remembrance by repetition 
          aloud or Sotto Voce. In Sikh parlance, this is known as 'Naam Simran'. 
          There are, however, many a Sikh who also meditate upon and use Ek-Onkar 
          for 'Naam Simran'. Like 'Waheguru' this is also considered to be a powerful 
          Mantra for achieving spiritual progress and Divine Grace for final emancipation 
          of the individual soul.</font>
        <p> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In conclusion, 
          it can be said that Ek-Onkar is the true symbol of Sikhism given to 
          us by Guru Nanak based on his spiritual experience and inspired vision 
          at the very inception of the Sikh faith. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">
