        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smoking and drug 
          taking is banned in Sikhism and using tobacco is listed in the Sikh 
          Rehat Maryada (Code of Conduct ) as one of the four transgression (Kurahits). 
          The Sikh Rehat Maryada was drafted by an expert committee of eminent 
          Sikh scholars. Many western friends of mine are surprised that Sikhism 
          explicitly forbids the use of tobacco and this may be because there 
          is no prohibition of tobacco use in other religions. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Tobacco first started 
          being used for smoking around 100 B.C. by native Americans tribes and 
          the Europeans first came into contact with it when Columbus discovered 
          America. During the nest two centuries tobacco use was spread by the 
          Europeans across the entire known world. it is interesting to note that 
          tobacco was paid to the English clergy as wages right upto the 1750's. 
          Tobacco was introduced by the Portuguese into India during the 17th 
          century. It was traded through the Portuguese trading post on the west 
          coast of India. During the time of Guru Gobind Singh tobacco use had 
          become common by the Mughal nobles. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It may appear strange 
          to people of other religions as to why Sikhism has such a Anti-smoking 
          stance, the reason is that smoking is recorded as being forbidden by 
          all the Sikh writers who were contemporaries of the 10th Guru. According 
          to these writers Guru Gobind Singh was once riding with his Sikhs when 
          he suddenly stopped his horse and after dismounting proceeded to rip 
          out a wild tobacco plant. The Sikhs asked why the Guru had ripped the 
          plant out and the Guru replied that the Sikhs should avoid alcohol as 
          it destroys a generation but tobacco destroys several generations. The 
          Guru then forbade his Sikhs to ever use tobacco. Early European writers 
          who came across the Sikhs in the 1780's were perplexed as to why tobacco 
          was forbidden for the Sikhs as tobacco was being widely used by both 
          the British and the Indians at that time. Of all the Nations that the 
          Europeans came into contact with the Sikhs were the only one who had 
          a religious injection against tobacco. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Until the 1950's 
          smoking was encouraged by governments as a means to acquire tax. Only 
          in 1950 when Morton Levin published his study into the connection between 
          lung cancer and smoking did any governments take notice. according to 
          the World Health Organization report of 1995 worldwide lung cancer is 
          the biggest single cause of cancer deaths in men. Smoking causes approximately 
          3 million deaths worldwide and if current trends persist it will kill 
          10 million a year from 2020. Smoking causes about 20.5% of all deaths 
          in developed countries. These are frightening statistics but the biggest 
          tragedy is that smoking is the single largest preventable factor in 
          premature death, disability and disease. These effects of smoking are 
          not limited to the smokers themselves but to those around them. Family, 
          friends and even complete strangers in the smoker's vacinity suffer. 
          Smoking while pregnant has been linked to sudden infant death syndrome 
          (cot death), bronchitis, pneumonia and higher risk of miscarriage (The 
          Guru had said that tobacco would destroy several generations) </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Apart from the 
          effects on health , smoking also takes a large chunk of family budgets 
          sometimes as much as 20% if both parents smoke. Smoking is increasing 
          in developing countries amongst people who can ill afford the habit. 
          There are roughly 1.1 billion smokers worldwide about 17 % of the total 
          population and about 6000 billion cigarettes are smoked every year. 
          According to some estimates about 300 million is spent on the habit 
          worldwide with about 100 billion being spent in the developing countries. 
          This sheer wastage is borne by families who live in slum quarters unable 
          to better themselves due to the drain on their resources caused by smoking. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Sikhs have 
          escaped from the effects of the 'evil weed' and the absence of smoking 
          amongst Sikhs has been noted by several western writer when they visit 
          India. Today the Sikhs can wonder at the foresight of their Great Guru 
          Gobind Singh that he foresaw the miseries that would stem from the tobacco 
          plant and wisely instructed the Sikhs to keep it at an arms length. 
          Such foresight is indeed befitting a great prophet of Waheguru. </font>
