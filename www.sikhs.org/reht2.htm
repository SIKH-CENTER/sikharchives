                then Arjan, Hargobind and Harirai. Meditate then on revered Hari 
                Krishan on seeing whom all suffering vanishes. Think then of Tegh 
                Bahadar, remembrance of whom brings all nine treasures. He comes

                got their bodies dismembered bit by bit, got their skulls sawn off, 
                got mounted on spiked wheels, got their bodies sawn, made sacrifices 
                in the service of the shrines (gurdwaras), did not betray their

                of such remembrance, may total well-being obtain. Wherever there 
                are communities of the Khalsa, may there be Divine protection and 
                grace, and ascendance of the supply of needs and of the holy sword, 
                protection of the tradition of grace, victory to the Panth, the 
                succour of the holy sword, ascendance of the Khalsa. Say, O Khalsa,

                Say, “Wondrous Destroyer of darkness”. May the Khalsa be imbued 
                with humility and high wisdom! May Waheguru guard its understanding!<br>
                O Immortal Being, eternal helper of Thy Panth, benevolent Lord,
