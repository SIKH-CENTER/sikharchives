  Nam Karan, Naming of a Child</font></h3>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As soon as the 
        mother and child are able to travel, the family visits the Gurdwara. There 
        they recite joyful hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib to celebrate the birth 
        of the new child. Karah Prashad (sacred pudding) is prepared by the family. 
        Amrit (sweet water) is also prepared and given to the infant as well as 
        the mother. The name is chosen by taking the Hukam, the granthi randomly 
        opens Sri Guru Granth Sahib to any page and reads the hymn on that page. 
        The first letter of the first word of the hymn is chosen. The child's 
        name is than chosen beginning with that letter and is announced to the 
        congregation. </font> 
       
        <p> 
        
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_o.gif"> 
  Amrit Sanskar, Baptism</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This is the sacred 
          ceremony for the initiation into the Khalsa brotherhood. It should be 
          taken only by those who are fully mature enough to realize the commitment 
          required and the significance. The initiate may be a man or woman of any 
          caste or previous religion. Generally they are encouraged to start behaving, 
          acting and looking like a Sikh before seeking baptism. The baptism is 
          done in a quiet place away from distractions where Sri Guru Granth Sahib 
          has been installed. The initiate is required to wash their hair, cover 
          their head, wear clean clothes and the 5K's before presenting themselves 
          before 6 amritdhari Sikhs (those who are already baptized). Five amritdhari 
          Sikhs will conduct the ceremony while one reads Sri Guru Granth Sahib. 
          The principals of Sikhism are explained to the initiate and this is followed 
          by Ardas and taking of the Hukam (opening of Sri Guru Granth Sahib to 
          a random page and reading of a hymn). Amrit (sweet sugar water) is prepared 
          in a steel bowl and stirred with a kirpan by the five beloved ones while 
          Japuji, Jaap, Ten Sawayyas, Bainti Chaupai and 6 verses from Anand Sahib 
          are recited. This is followed by Ardas and the initiate drinking the amrit 
          five times in cupped hands and exclaiming Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru 
          Ji Ki Fateh (The Pure Belong to God, Victory to God). Amrit is then sprinkled 
          on the hair and eyes of the initiate and any leftover is drunk by all 
          present. This is followed by an explanation of the code of conduct and 
          discipline required for a Khalsa. The Khalsa is required to wear the 5K's 
          and abstain from 1) cutting hair, 2) eating Muslim halal meat, 3) cohabiting 
          with a person other than ones spouse and 4) using intoxicants such as 
          tobacco. Other breaches of the code of conduct are also explained before 
          Ardas is once again repeated. This is followed by taking Hukam and eating 
          of karah prasad (sacred pudding) from a common bowl. If a person does 
          not have a Sikh name, they take a new name at this time.</font> </p>

  Funeral Ceremony</font></h3>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In Sikhism death 
        is considered a natural process and God's will. Any public displays of 
        grief at the funeral such as wailing or crying out loud are discouraged. 
        Cremation is the preferred method of disposal, although if it is not possible 
        any other method such as burial or submergence at sea are acceptable. 
        Worship of the dead with gravestones, etc. is discouraged, because the 
        body is considered to be only the shell, the person's soul is their real 
        essence. The body is usually bathed and clothed by family members and 
        taken to the cremation grounds. There hymns are recited which induce feeling 
        of detachment are recited by the congregation. As the body is being cremated, 
        Kirtan Sohila the nighttime prayer is recited and Ardas is offered. The 
        ashes are disposed of by immersing them in the nearest river. A non continuos 
        reading of the entire Sri Guru Granth Sahib is undertaken and timed to 
        conclude on the tenth day. This may be undertaken at home or in the Gurdwara. 
        The conclusion of this ceremony marks the end of the mourning period.

  Akhand Path</font></h3>
        
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This is the non-stop 
          cover to cover reading of Sri Guru Granth Sahib which is undertaken to 
          celebrate any joyous occasion or in times of hardship, such as birth, 
          marriage, death, moving into a new house, and Gurpurbs. The non stop reading 
          takes approximately 48 hours and is carried out be family members, or 
          professional readers in the presence of the family. The reading must be 
          clear and correct so that it can be understood by all listeners. After 
          the completion of the reading the Bhog ceremony takes place. A Hukam is 
          taken by randomly turning to any page and reading the hymn on that page. 
        Karah parshad (sacred pudding) is also distributed to all present.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This ceremony evolved 
          in the mid 18th century when there were few hand written copies of Sri 
          Guru Granth Sahib. Sikhs were fighting for their lives at this time 
          and hiding in jungles. They would all gather to hear whatever portion 
          of a reading that they could before Sri Guru Granth Sahib would me moved 
          to another location for another audience. Performance of Akhand Path 
          as a blind ritual is highly disrespectful to Sri Guru Granth Sahib and 
          contrary to the teachings of the Gurus.</font>

  Gurpurbs</font></h3>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Important anniversaries 
        associated with the lives of the Gurus are referred to as Gurpurbs. These 
        are usually marked at gurdwaras with Akand Path (continuos cover to cover 
        reading of Sri Guru Granth Sahib) concluding on the specific day. There 
        is also kirtan (musical recitation of hymns from Sri Guru Granth Sahib) 
        as well as katha (lectures on Sikhism). Some places also have nagar kirtan, 
        where there is a procession with Sri Guru Granth Sahib led by 5 Sikhs 
        carrying Nishan Sahibs (the Sikh flag). Free sweets and langar are also 
        offered to the general public outside some gurdwaras. </font>

          Vaisakhi</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Amar Das 
          first institutionalized this as one of the special days when all Sikhs 
          would gather to receive the Gurus blessings at Goindwal in 1567. In 1699 
          Guru Gobind Singh gathered thousands at Anandpur Sahib and founded the 
          Khalsa order by baptizing 5 brave Sikhs who were willing to give their 
          life for the Guru. The Five Beloved Ones in turn baptized Guru Gobind 
          Singh into the Khalsa brotherhood. This day celebrated around April 13 
          is considered the birthday of the Khalsa order. Sikhs visits gurdwaras 
          and fairs and parades are held. Many Sikhs choose to be baptized into 
          the Khalsa brotherhood on this day, as well the wrappings of the Nishan 
        Sahib flag post at most gurdwaras are changed on Vaisakhi. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: Vaisakhi is not the Sikh New Year. Vaisakhi occurs in the second month of the Sikh calendar. The Sikh New Year is on Chet 1 according to the Sikh calendar which occurs on March 14th every year. See the Sikh Calendar for more information</font>        </p>

        Immortals. The largest gathering happens at Muktsar where an annual fair 
        is held. It occurs on the first day of Maghar Sangrant, around January 
        14. Forty followers of Guru Gobind Singh who had previously deserted him, 
        fought bravely against overwhelming Mughal army forces and were martyred 
        here. Guru Gobind Singh personally blessed them as having achieved mukti

  Hola Mohalla</font></h3>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> An annual festival 
        of thousands held at Anandpur Sahib. It was started by Guru Gobind Singh 
        as a gathering of Sikhs for military exercises and mock battles on the 
        day following the Indian festival of Holi. The mock battles were followed 
        by music and poetry competitions. The Nihang Singh's carry on the martial 
        tradition with mock battles and displays of swordsmanship and horse riding. 
        There are also a number of durbars where Sri Guru Granth Sahib is present 
        and kirtan and religious lectures take place. The festival culminates 
        in a large parade headed by the nishan sahibs of the gurdwaras in the 
        region. Hola Mohalla is held around March 17. </font>

        Maha, Song of the 12 Months, by Guru Arjan (pg. 133) or sometimes 
        Bara Maha by Guru Nanak (pg. 1107). This day just marks the beginning
