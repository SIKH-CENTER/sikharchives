  <br>
  <img src="images\bullet_k.gif" align="absmiddle"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Reincarnation<br>
Like Hinduism Sikhims believes in the transmigration of the soul. There 
        are countless cycles of births and deaths. One only breaks this cycle 
        when they achieve mukhti (merger with God) </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif" align="absmiddle"> Karma<br>
  Karma regulates the reincarnation and transmigration of the soul, Sikhism 
  links Karma with the doctrine of Grace.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Mortals obtain 
  a human body as a result of good deeds but he reaches the gate ofsalvation 
  with God's kind grace.&quot; (Guru Nanak, Japji)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif" align="absmiddle"> Maya<br>
  The world is just an illusion and some get enchanted with this illusion 
  and forget God</font> </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Differences</font></h3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> Sikhism rejects polytheism and accepts monotheism. Whereas Sikhism starts 
        with one God and universalizes Him, Hinduism starts with many Gods and 
        occasionally gives glimpses of 'One'. </font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;I do not accept 
  Ganesha as important. I do not meditate on Krishna, neither on Vishnu. 
  I do not hear them and do not recognize them. My love is with the Lotus 
  feet of God. He is my protector, the Supreme Lord. I am dust of his 
  Lotus feet.&quot; (Guru Gobind Singh, Krishna Avatar)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif">Authority 
  of the Vedas and the belief that the truth revealed in them is absolute 
  and that reading them one can realize perfection.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;I have read 
  all the Vedas, but my mind's separation from God is not removed and 
  the five demons of my house (body) are stilled not even for an instant.&quot; 
  (Guru Arjan Dev, Ashtpadis, pg. 687)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif" align="absmiddle"> Sikhism does not recognize any priestly class.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Kabir, the 
  Brahman may be the Guru of the world, but he is not the Guru of the 
  saints. He rots to death in the perplexities of the four Vedas&quot; (Bhagat 
  Kabir, Salok, pg. 1377)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> Rejection of the Ashrama Dharma theory of dividing man's life into four 
  stages. Instead the Gurus emphasized living the householders life. Rejection 
  of the Varna distinction of division of human society into higher and 
  lower castes.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;There are four 
  castes of the literates, warriors, cultivators and menials and the four 
  stages of life. He who meditates on the Lord is the most distinguished 
  amongst men.&quot; (Guru Ram Das, Gond, pg. 861)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;The Lord asks 
  not mortals caste and birth, so find thou out the Lord's True Home (truth). 
  That alone is man's caste and that his glory, as are the deeds which 
  he does.&quot; (Guru Nanak, Parbhati, pg. 1330)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> The Gurus rejected the Avtara theory of the incarnations of God. The 
  Gurus not only exposed the mortality of these gods but used stories 
  to illustrate moral values, such as 'pride leads to a fall' illustrated 
  by the story of Harnakhash, untouchability becoming superior through 
  devotion to God by Krishna stories and stories where Bhrahma, Vishnu 
  and Shiva are shown to be ordinary mortals. The Gurus stressed that 
  there is only one God and that these gods and goddeses were not true.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;In every age, 
  the Lord creates the kings, who are sung of as His incarnations. Even 
  they have not found His limits.&quot; (Guru Amar Das, Ashtpadis, pg. 423)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Millions of 
  incarnations of Vishnu and Shiv, with matted hair Desire Thee, O Kind 
  Lord, with endless longing of their mind and body. Infinite and Inaccessible 
  is Lord, the World Sustainer, and He is the Omnipresent wealthy Master. 
  The gods, perfect persons, heavenly heralds and celestial singers contemplate 
  on Thee. The greater gods and heavenly dancers utter Thine praises. 
  Myrids of kings, gods and many super human beings remember the Lord 
  and hail Him.&quot; (Guru Arjan Dev, Chhant, pg. 455)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif" align="absmiddle"> Worship of idols and images.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;The blind ignorant 
  ones stray in doubt and so deluded, deluded they pluck flowers for worship. 
  They worship the lifeless stones and adore tombs. Their service all 
  goes in vain.&quot; (Guru Ram Das, Malar, pg. 1264)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;They who say 
  the stone is a god; in vain is their service. He who falls at the feet 
  of the stone; vain goes his labour. My Lord ever speaks. The Lord gives 
  gifts to all the living beings. The Lord is within, but the blind one 
  knows not. Deluded by doubt, he is caught in a noose. The stone speaks 
  not, nor gives anything. In vain are the ceremonies of the idolater, 
  and fruitless his service.&quot; (Guru Arjan Dev, Bhairo, pg. 1160)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> The Gita and Vedanta goal of a Mukt. Once he achieves salvation he does 
  not live for the community. In Sikhism the Gurmukh achieving salvation 
  lives to save others.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Abandon lust, 
  wrath, avarice and worldly love. Thus be rid of both birth and death. 
  Distress and darkness shall depart from thy home, when, within thee, 
  the Guru implants wisdom and lights the Divine lamp. He, who serves 
  the Lord crosses the sea of life. Through the Guru, O slave Nanak, the 
  entire world is saved.&quot; (Guru Arjan Dev, Gauri, pg. 241)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif" align="absmiddle"> Belief that reading of the six Shastras and their mastery will bring 
  salvation.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;The greatly 
  voluminous Simirtis and Shastras stretch out the extension of worldly 
  love. The fools read them, but know not their Lord. Some rare one knows 
  Him by the Guru's grace. Of Himself the Creator does and makes others 
  do. By means of the True Bani, He implants truth within the mortal.&quot; 
  (Guru Amar Das, Maru, pg. 1053)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Many Shashtras 
  and many Simirtis have I seen and searched them all. Nanak, they equal 
  not Lord God's invaluable Name.&quot; (Guru Arjan Dev, Gauri, pg. 265)</i></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif" align="absmiddle"> Rejection of Sanskrit or any language as being sacred.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font> </p>
