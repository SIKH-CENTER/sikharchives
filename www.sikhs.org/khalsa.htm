&quot;He who keeps alight the unquenchable torch of truth, and never swerves 
        from the thought of One God; he who has full love and confidence in God 
        and does not put his faith, even by mistake, in fasting or the graves 
        of Muslim saints, Hindu crematoriums, or Jogis places of sepulchre; he 
        who recognises the One God and no pilgrimages, alms-giving, non-destruction 
        of life, penances, or austerities; and in whose heart the light of the 
        Perfect One shines, - he is to be recognised as a pure member of the Khalsa&quot;

            word &quot;Khalsa&quot; means &quot;pure&quot;, Khalsa's are Sikhs which have undergone 
            the sacred Amrit Ceremony initiated by the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind 
            Singh. The Khalsa order was initially created on Baisakhi Day March 
            30 1699, with Guru Gobind Singh baptizing 5 Sikhs and then in turn asking 
            the five Khalsa's to baptize him. Following this the Guru personally 
            baptized thousands of men and women into the Khalsa order. The Khalsa 
            baptism ceremony is undertaken as part of ones own personal spiritual 
            evolution when the initiate is ready to fully live up to the high expectations 
            of Guru Gobind Singh. All Sikhs are expected to be Khalsa or be working 
          towards that objective.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Khalsa baptism 
            ceremony involves drinking of Amrit (sugar water stirred with a dagger) 
            in the presence of 5 Khalsa Sikhs as well as the Guru Granth Sahib. 
            The initiate is instructed in the following; (a) You shall never remove 
            any hair from any part of thy body, (b) You shall not use tobacco, alcohol 
            or any other intoxicants, (c) You shall not eat the meat of an animal 
            slaughtered the Muslim way, (d) You shall not commit adultery. The initiate 
            is required to wear the physical symbols of a Khalsa at all times as 
            well as follow the Khalsa Code of Conduct.</font> </p>

              religious followers who keep long hair but wear caps or keep matted 
              hair. The turban cannot be covered by any other head gear or replaced
