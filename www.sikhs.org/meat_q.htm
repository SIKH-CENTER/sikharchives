          <h3>Sri Guru Granth Sahib Quotes </h3>
        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meat classifed 
          with good foods such as bread, not bad foods such as wine</font></b>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The body is the 
          bottle, self-conceit is the wine, and desire is the company of drinking 
          companions. The glass of the mind’s longing is filled to overflowing 
          with falsehood; the Messenger of Death is the bartender. Drinking in 
          this wine, O Nanak, one takes on countless vices and corruption. So 
          make spiritual wisdom your molasses, and the Praise of God your bread; 
          let the Fear of God be the dish of meat. O Nanak, this is the true food; 
          let the True Name be your only Support.&quot; (Baba Mardana, Bihagara, pg. 
          553)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>In the society 
          of the times meat was avoided by Hindus and certain kinds by the Muslims. 
          The Gurus tried to explain to these people that it was not eating meat 
          was not the real sin but:</b></font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Taking anothers 
          right is the real thing to be avoided</i><br>
  &quot;Nanak, another's right is swine for him (the Musalman) and cow for 
          him (the Hindu).&quot; (Guru Nanak, pg. 141)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Falsehood is 
          the real thing to avoid</i><br>
  &quot;By uttering falsehood, man eats meat, Yet, he goes to admonish others. 
          Such appears to be the leader, O' Nanak! who himself is beguiled and 
          beguiles his comrades.&quot; (Guru Nanak, Slok, pg. 140)<br>
  &quot;Falsehood is my dagger and to eat by defrauding is meat.&quot; (Guru Nanak, 
          Sri Rag, pg. 24)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Evil intellect, 
          heartlesness, slander and wrath are the real things to avoid</i><br>
          “Evil-intellect is the she drummer, heartlessness is the butcheress, 
          other’s slander in the heart is a sweepress and deceitful wrath is a 
          pariah-woman” (Guru Nanak, Slok, pg. 91)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Avarice, falsehood, 
          cheatings and slander are the real things to avoid</i><br>
          “Avarice is a dog., falsehood the sweeper and cheating the eating of 
          meat. Slandering others solely amounts to puting other’s filth in ones 
          own mouth and fire of wrath is a pariah.” (Guru Nanak, Sri Rag, pg.15)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Gurus clearly 
          stated what are sins throughout the Guru Granth Sahib, nowhere is eating 
          meat mentioned as being one of these sins.</b></font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Taking halter, 
          men go out at night to strangle others, but the Lord knows all, O mortal. 
          Concealed in places they look at other women. They break into places, 
          difficult to acceess and enjoy wine deeming it sweet. Over their respective 
          misdeeds, they shall themselves afterwards regret. Azrail, the courier 
          of death shall crush them like the mill full of sesame.&quot; (Guru Arjan 
          Dev, Pauri, pg. 315)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Renounce sexual 
          pleasures, wrath, falsehood and calumny, forsake worldly valuables and 
          dispel pride. Put aside the lust for belles and leave worldly love. 
          Then shalt thou obtain the bright Lord amidst the dark world. Eschew 
          self-adoration, egotism and affection for thy sons and wife. Shed thirst 
          and desire for wealth and embrace love for the omnipresent Lord. Nanak, 
          he, in whose mind the True One abides, through the True Gurbani gets 
          absorbed in God's Name.&quot; (Guru Ram Das, pg. 141)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Abandon lust, 
          wrath, avarice and worldly love. Thus be rid of both birth and death. 
          Distress and darkness shall depart from thy home, when, within thee, 
          the Guru implants wisdom and lights the Divine lamp. He, who serves 
          the Lord crosses the sea of life. Through the Guru, O slave Nanak, the 
          entire world is saved.&quot; (Guru Arjan Dev, Gauri, pg. 241)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the fire of 
          desire, avarice, arrogance and excessive egotism the man is burning. 
          He repeatedly goes, comes and loses his honour. His life he wastes away 
          in vain. Rare is the person who understands Gurbani.&quot; ( Guru Amar Das, 
          Majh, pg 120)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The superstitions 
          of the impurity of certain foods such as meat exposed and the real emphasis 
          revealed:</b></font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the principle 
          of impurity be admitted, then there is impurity everywhere.<br>
          In cow-dung and wood there are worms.<br>
          As many as are the grains of corn, none is without life.<br>
          In the first place there is life in water, by which, all are made green.<br>
          How can impurity be warded off? It falls on our own kitchen.<br>
          Nanak, impurity is not removed like this. It is washed away by Divine 
          Knowledge.<br>
          The mind's impurity is avarice and the tongue's impurity falsehood.<br>
          The impurity of the eyes is to behold another's woman, another's wealth 
          and beauty.<br>
          The impurity of the ears is to hear the slander of others with ears,<br>
          Nanak, mortal's soul goes bout to the city of death.<br>
          All impurity consists in doubt and attachment to duality.<br>
          Birth and death are subject to Lord's command and through His will mortal 
          comes and goes.<br>
          Eating and drinking are pure, for the Lord has given sustenance to all.<br>
          Nanak, the Gurmukh who know the Lord, to them impurity sticks not.&quot;<br>
          (Guru Nanak, Slok, pg. 472)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What can be achieved 
          by eating and what by dressing, so long as that True Lord abides not 
          in the man's mind? What is fruit, what clarified butter and sweet molasses, 
          what fine flour and what meat? What is rainment and what comfortable 
          couch to enjoy sexual intercourse and revelments? Of what use is an 
          army and of what the mace-bearers, servants and coming and dwelling 
          in mansions? Nanak, without the True Name, the entire paraphernalia 
          is perishable.&quot; (Guru Nanak, pg. 142)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The True food 
          is the Lord's love. So says the True Guru. With the True food I am appeased 
          and with Truth I am delighted.&quot; (Guru Angad, Pauri, pg. 146)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The world-hardened 
          men, who eat poison by repeatedly telling lies, the Lord Himself has 
          led astray. They know not the ultimate reality of departure, and increase 
          the poison of lust and wrath.&quot; (Guru Amar Das, Pauri, pg. 145)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Without the Name 
          all, which man wears and eats is poison. By praising the True Name one 
          merges in the True Master.&quot; (Guru Nanak, Pauri, pg.144)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By reading and 
          reciting men grow weary but they obtain not peace. By desire they are 
          consumed, and they have no knowledge of it. Poison they purchase and 
          for the love of poison they are thirsty. By telling lies they eat poison.&quot; 
          (Guru Amrar Das, Majh, pg. 120)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I have tasted 
          and seen all other relishes but to my mind the God's dainty is the sweetest 
          of all.&quot; (Guru Arjan Dev, Majh, pg.100)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Do thou only that 
          by which filth may not attach to thee, and this soul of thine may remain 
          awake in singing God's praises.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Meditate on the 
          One Lord, and think not duality.<br>
          In the guild of saints repeat only the Name.<br>
          Rituals, duty, religious rites, fasting and worship are all covered 
          recognising none else in sans the Supreme Lord.<br>
          Of him the toil is approved, whose affection is with his own Master.<br>
          Infinitely invaluable is that vegetarian (Vishnavite), says Nanak; who 
          renounced sins.&quot;<br>
          (Guru Arjan Dev, Gauri, pg. 199)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Let somone sing, 
          someone hear, someone reflect on, someone preach the Name of God and 
          somone fix it in his mind, he shall forthwith be saved. His sins shall 
          be effaced, he shall become pure and his filth of many births shall 
          be washed off. In this world and the next world, his countenance shall 
          be bright, and mammon shall not affect him. He is the man of wisdom, 
          he the vegetarian, he the divine and the man of wealth; He is the hero, 
          and he is of high family, who has meditated on the Fortunate Lord.&quot; 
          (Guru Arjan Dev, Pauri, pg. 300)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Self-conceit and 
          wealth are all poison. Attached therewith, man ever suffers loss in 
          this world. By pondering on the Name, the Guru-ward earns the profit 
          of God's wealth. By placing God and God's elixir in the mind, the poison 
          of the filth of ego is removed.&quot; (Guru Ram Das, Slok, pg. 300)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The attachment 
          of all the visible objects is all impurity. Due to this, the mortal 
          dies and is reborn again and again. Impurity is in fire, air and water. 
          Within all the food, which we eat, there is pollution. Defilement is 
          in mans actions as he performs not God's worship.&quot; (Guru Amar Das, Gauri 
          Guareri, pg. 229)</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Without the Name

          sugarcane is sheared. After cleansing and chopping off its plumes, its 
          feet are bound to form it into bundles. Placing it in between the wooden 
          rollers of the press, they crush and award it punishment. Extracting 
          the juice, they put it in the cauldron and it groans as it burns. Even 
          the empty crushed cane is collected and is burnt in the fire. Nanak, 
          how the sweet-leaved sugar-cane is treated, come and see, O’ people!&quot;

          and vegetables for millions of years, God has not designed meat eating
