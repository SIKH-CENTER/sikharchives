          <h3>Terms &amp; Phrases</h3>
   
        
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many volumes can 
          be written on this, and the next two sections. I am now, simply going 
          to list some Sikh vocabulary, some buzzwords. They represent the core 
          of the Sikh thought, conduct, and tradition, not subject to change with 
          the fads of the ever-changing society. This list is not complete. From 
          a philosophical view, each of these is just a different facet of Naam. 
          I apologize, for using too many non-English words. If you want, you 
          may go to the next sections first and read this later. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A student of Sikh 
          Panth should understand at least these. They are not in an alphabetical 
          order:</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Gurudwara:</b> 
          A Sikh place of worship. In a Gurudwara, any Gursikhs can take turns 
          to lead the activity as long as they respect Maryada and time constraints. 
          A Granthi (Custodian) or a secretary is merely there to maintain order.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Amrit:</b> Ambrosia 
          of eternal life, the Initiation of a Gursikh with Amrit, a Sikh form 
          of Baptism. When the Sikh submits completely to the Guru, Five Gursikhs 
          give him instructions regarding the Nitt Name, the Rehet, and how to 
          meditate on a Word. Waheguru is the Sikh Gurmantra. Amrit is the only 
          way to spiritually receive Gurmantra from the Sikh Guru. Having a Gurmantra 
          is not an exclusive privilege of a Gursikh, though. It is an ancient 
          practice, followed in some form by all serious seekers and Saints. Meditation 
          on the Sikh Gurmantra without Amrit is compared to someone trying to 
          earn a diploma without being enrolled in the school. A Gurmantra, with 
          submission to a Guru and proper meditation, is essential for a true 
          repose in God, leading to a wholesome life. To stress this, this is 
          the only time the Fifth Master has used such harsh words: &quot;A living 
          being without a Gurmantra turns his precious human birth into disgrace. 
          He becomes putrefied and foul. This fool is like a (helpless) dog, a 
          (muck loving) swine, a donkey (toiling for others), a (vagrant) crow, 
          and a (venomous) snake.&quot; (SGGS, p.1356)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rehet or Reht:</b> 
          The Sikh conduct, whether alone or in the company of others, as The 
          Tenth Master explained to the &quot;Five Beloved.&quot; Rehet has the 
          essential attributes of Tenth Master's lifestyle, including the five 
          K's (see the next section) and the Nitt Name. In the words of The Tenth 
          Master, &quot;My Sikh is only he who lives the Rehet, he is my master 
          and I am his servant.&quot; Why? Rehet allows The Tenth Master to turn 
          the Sikh into Khalsa, which is his own personality.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Maryada:</b> 
          Rules for conducting various ceremonies in a Sikh's life, including 
          procedures in the Gurudwara.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Gurbani or Bani:</b> 
          The verses in the Sikh Scripture, <b>Guru Granth Sahib</b>. Any other 
          verses or writings may be respected, but they are not to be considered 
          as Gurbani. To emphasize this, The Tenth Master did not include his 
          own writings in the Guru Granth Sahib, though they should be considered 
          as Gurbani. Gurbani acts as a verbal teacher, as well as the Shabad. 
          The Tenth Master mandated: &quot;The Panth was launched only after God's 
          command. All Sikhs are ordained to regard the Granth as the Guru. You 
          shall see Guru Granth Ji as the Guru's physical body. Whoever wants 
          to see God, can search, and find all the guidance in the Shabad.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          <b>Shabad or Shabd:</b> The Word. God's Voice. God's Light. It is manifest 
          to the world in Gurbani, now in Guru Granth Sahib. Shabad is useless 
          without <b>Surat:</b> Inner attention fixed on the Shabad. Surat is 
          the place where <b>Shabad (Gurbani)</b> acts. When Surat is tied to 
          Shabad through Guru's Mercy, a sad but peaceful and spontaneous, melody 
          of God's Love can be &quot;heard&quot; in the mind, and in everything 
          else. Then the Shabad is felt to be present everywhere. A seeker follows 
          this delicate thread, leading him to where the Shabad resides. Some 
          day, by Guru's Grace the seeker gives up everything, including food 
          and personal care, but he would not let this thread go. This is one 
          example of Naam (God's Name). The Gurbani stresses its importance by 
          repeatedly recounting the stories of its practice by Kabir, Namdev, 
          Dhruva and Prahalad. Only this kind of union with Naam creates a perfect 
          Saint (Sant).</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Satt:</b> Being 
          a man of your word. Having a yearning for the absolute Truth. <b>Santokh:</b> 
          Contentment. To give up chasing things of the world, and <b>Vichaar:</b> 
          Reflection. Analyzing Guru's message. These are three prerequisites 
          for understanding Gurbani. A Sikh is expected to understand and absorb 
          when he reads and recites Gurbani, not just use it as a mouthwash.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nam or Naam:</b> 
          Worship of God during all activity. Not forgetting Him, and thanking 
          Him for his gifts, life, body, and other things of the world, while, 
          not losing your soul among those things. Realization that life without 
          Him, like a leaf broken away from a tree, cannot thrive. Holding on 
          to God as the ultimate aim of life at every moment, just like a mother 
          cannot forget her newborn child during all her activities. This needs 
          to be developed as an inner, mental habit, not to become a show. In 
          time, it turns into perpetual inner exchanges with God.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Daan:</b> Giving. 
          Taking care of the needy, giving to the poor. The spiritual gift of 
          Naam is considered as the greatest Daan.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ishnan:</b> A 
          spiritual act of washing oneself with prayer and water before dawn. 
          A bath or shower taken after dawn is not considered as Ishnan.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nitt Nem:</b> 
          Daily Routine. This includes Ishnan, Simran and meditative recitation 
          of five prescribed pieces of Gurbani: The Japji, Jaap Sahib, Anand Sahib, 
          Savaiyae, and Chaupaee. A spiritual practice is considered a routine, 
          and it starts being fruitful, after it has been practiced for forty 
          consecutive days.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Amrit Vela:</b> 
          Last three hours of the night, the ambrosial hours. This time is reserved 
          for meditation and Ishnan. A Sikh should not waste these precious moments 
          in useless talk etc. Meditation during these hours is infinitely more 
          fruitful than meditation done at any other hour of the day or night.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Hukam or Hukm:</b> 
          Command, God's Will: Realizing that only God is the real doer and everything 
          is working out according to His Will. Accepting His work above personal 
          preference and desires. Since Guru's Command is in-tune with God's will, 
          it is also the Hukam.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Haumei:</b> Ego, 
          the basic human disease. This is the real sin. All other sins originate 
          from the ego: Feeling rational and self-sufficient while apparently 
          thriving as separated from God. Pride, or, self-condemnation. Feeling 
          responsible for one's past actions. An outlook, as if we are in complete 
          control of our life. Ego is the opposite of Hukam. Ego comes in countless 
          and deceptive forms and shapes. To avoid this, a Sikh does not worship 
          God as the Self. Ego is the only barrier between the man and his true 
          nature. Obeying the True Guru's teaching and his Command is the only 
          way to release the heart and soul from the grips, and invisible chains 
          of ego.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Waheguru:</b> 
          The <b>Gurmantra</b>. It is the word for meditation. It is a pregnant 
          word. It is also used as a synonym of &quot;God.&quot; Its meaning, 
          just like Gurbani, continues to renew and expand for the seeker who 
          meditates on it. Literally, it means, &quot;God-Guru, The Spiritual 
          Light, You are beyond description.&quot; A Sikh worships only One, formless 
          God, who has no limits, and who is able to transcend His own laws.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nam Japna or 
          Simran:</b> Meditation on God's Name, seeing Waheguru everywhere. Repetition 
          of Gurmantra with breath, as explained during Amrit, the Sikh form of 
          baptism. Breaths taken without the Simran are totally wasted. Just like 
          something most precious is allowed to run out from a leaking container, 
          without making a good use of it. This is why, upon realization of this 
          loss, a Sikh prays to have &quot;a million mouths&quot; (tongues), so 
          that he can make up with what is left so far. This realization is not 
          possible without Sadh Sangat.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Wand Chhakna:</b> 
          Feeding the hungry before feeding oneself. Sharing everything with the 
          needy. It seems the Gurus advocated this form of socialism, implemented 
          at the personal level.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dharam Di Kirat:</b> 
          To earn only an honest livelihood. Not accepting gifts that are not 
          earned.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Daswandh:</b> 
          Tithing. Giving 10 percent of income to the Guru, or to poor and needy 
          Sikhs.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sangat:</b> A 
          Spiritual alliance. Gursikhs gathered for singing of Kirtan, discussion, 
          and meditation on Gurbani with other Sikhs. Often overlooked: Correct 
          and steady posture with crossed legs when sitting and, undivided attention 
          is also necessary. A parrot-like recital, or listening to prerecorded 
          Kirtan, while doing other things, is of little value.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sat Sangat:</b> 
          Sangat gathered only for God's Voice and Nam. In Sikh Panth, sharing 
          God's Name with others is the highest form of Yoga. This is the purpose 
          of Gurbani. Among the Sikhs, to assure that we are engaged in a sharing 
          of True Naam without someone's ego contaminating it, a meeting is restricted 
          to singing (Kirtan) of Gurbani (From Guru Granth Sahib) or, listening 
          to Katha. The Tenth Master's writings are also considered as Gurbani, 
          though we know that he did not designate his own writings as the Guru.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Writings of Bhai 
          Gurdas and Bhai Nand Lal are the only other acceptable pieces, as footnotes, 
          for singing during Sat Sangat. This is because: 1) They were written 
          during the time of the ten Masters, who approved them, and 2) they are 
          written to help us follow Gurbani. They were not written with an intention 
          to replace, be equal to or as an addition to, the Gurbani. Other &quot;Satsangi&quot; 
          people, outside the Panth can do or sing whatever they like, a Sikh 
          does not argue with anyone. Quiet meditation on one word for a prolonged 
          period, generally does not build a Sat Sangat, because, everyone's thoughts 
          are not then harnessed by the music and Gurbani.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sadh Sangat:</b> 
          Spiritual company of a True Saint. For Sikhs, it is Guru Granth Sahib 
          in Sangat, or, Sangat of an enlightened Sikh, a Khalsa Gursikh. Sadh 
          Sangat, with Kirtan, is the best spiritual activity, higher than any 
          form of Yoga.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Pangat:</b> Sharing 
          of food while sitting together on floor mats, a traditional practice 
          to remove class differences and to generate humility. To feed and sit 
          with the homeless and the destitute. Sikh Gurus required all visitors, 
          even a king, to sit and eat in a Pangat with the homeless, before seeing 
          the Guru.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Seva:</b> Service 
          of the Guru without a desire for any outcome. Service of the Sangat 
          and others without ego. A neutralizer of Seva is to envy others who 
          do Seva or, to want a reward or recognition.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Jote and Jugat:</b> 
          The Light (Jote), and the Method (Jugat) for uncovering this Light. 
          These are two aspects of the Guru. Jote resides in Guru Granth Sahib. 
          Jugat cannot be explained. It is the proper inner conduct combined with 
          Rehet. It can be learned only through the company of other True Gursikhs. 
          Meditation without proper Jugat is not very fruitful in uncovering the 
          Jote. Jugat resides in the heart of a Khalsa. It resides in the Guru's 
          Mercy. Real Jugat starts only after Amrit from the Five Gursikhs. It 
          then unfolds in a Gursikh's heart through Simran, Sangat, and Seva. 
          Jugat also comes naturally through the service of a True Saint, which, 
          for a Sikh, is only a Khalsa.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Katha:</b> Listening 
          to history and works of the Ten Masters, and spiritual exposition of 
          Guru Shabad.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sanmukh:</b> 
          A Faithful Sikh. A Sikh with firm faith in the Guru finds that the Guru 
          always stays with him to help and guide him. He depends on the Guru's 
          inner guidance for each breath and activity, and does not do anything 
          without the Guru being present. This nurtures a spiritual link between 
          the Sikh and the Guru. Among other things, it also assures clean thoughts 
          and action. A Sanmukh Sikh sees his Guru in everyone. Its opposite is 
          <b>Bemukh</b>.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Deg (Dish):</b> 
          It symbolizes food. Food is a representative of God as His Love. A Sikh 
          does not take a bite without thanking God for this and His other Gifts. 
          A state of gratitude toward God, then, expands and accompanies all his 
          other activities. This is an important spiritual practice. It can even 
          lower your cholesterol and blood pressure! Deg is also a reminder that 
          a Sikh is to take care of the hungry. Hoarding food away from the hungry 
          is not in a Sikh's nature.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Guru Ka Langar:</b> 
          Guru's Free Kitchen is open to all at a place of worship, without discrimination 
          about a person's religion, race, political views, cast, class, or occupation. 
          Feeding each other's friends at the end of a meeting, as is common in 
          the western Gurudwaras, is not what the Gurus aimed for. It can be called 
          only a form of Pangat. Wherever possible, Guru Ka Langar is open all 
          days of the week, to feed the really needy and the poor. It is based 
          at a Gurudwara.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Teg or Kirpan 
          (Sword):</b> It symbolizes Force, or Mahan Kaal (The Great Destroyer). 
          This represents God, as Force, Death, and Mercy. Death, of the personal 
          ego, the evil, and, ultimately, everything that He created. The Sixth 
          and The Tenth Gurus taught the Sikhs to worship God also as the Force, 
          and not be afraid to fight and die for justice. Death during such an 
          act puts one directly in the lap of Force, or Mercy. For a Sikh, this 
          is the preferred form of death, than dying on a bed or in the ICU. This 
          does not mean that a dying Sikh is to go out and pick a fight with someone! 
          A Sikh is prepared to defend Dharma, and protect the persecuted and 
          the saints. He prays that, when he is old, he may die while engaged 
          in a combat with some tyrant. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Tenth Master 
          says: &quot;O Shiva, bless me so that: I may not avoid any pious deeds; 
          I may not be afraid when I fight with a tyrant; I may be always victorious 
          through my faith in you; I may preach only to myself; may my only desire 
          be to utter your praise; and when I am nearing death may I get executed 
          while fighting fiercely.&quot; (DG, p.99)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Parshad:</b> 
          A Gift out of pure Mercy, not because of any merit in the recipient. 
          It is a synonym of <b>Kirpa</b> (Grace) or, God's Merciful Touch. A 
          sweet dish served after the prayer as the representative of God's Grace, 
          after it is touched with Kirpan (A symbol of God's Mercy) is also called 
          Parshad.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Nanak Nam Charrdi Kala</b> (Nanak says, life under Your Name is always 
          advancing and cheerful) <b>Tere Bhanne Sarbatt Da Bhala</b> (Because, 
          whatever You do is, always for the best of everyone): This is the way 
          every <b>Ardas</b> (The Sikh Prayer) is concluded.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sat Siri Akal</b> 
          (Only God is immortal and real): This is the common way of greeting 
          among Sikhs.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Waheguru Ji Ka 
          Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh:</b> This is a required greeting between 
          Gursikhs. It represents the Khalsa Panth revealed by The Tenth Master. 
          Its meaning is, &quot;Khalsa is God-Guru's property, and ultimate victory 
          belongs only to Him.&quot;</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mool Mantra:</b> 
          The first stanza of Guru Granth Sahib. This is the foundation (Mool 
          = root) of Sikh philosophy. Mool Mantra is the first few words uttered 
          by Guru Nanak when he came out of a deep trance, after having disappeared 
          into the river for three days. Bhai Gurdas writes about Guru Nanak: 
          &quot;Guru Nanak engulfed the whole world in a spiritual light causing 
          the thick fog of ignorance to vanish. It is like the sun rising against 
          the stars, or, when a lion roars, all the deer go into hiding. Each 
          house is now a temple of worship. Kirtan and spiritual joy is the rule. 
          Finally, a Gurmukh has emerged during the Iron Age.&quot;</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We all know that 
          a whole book could be written on exposition of Mool Mantra alone, because 
          each statement has several deep implications. The whole Guru Granth 
          Sahib can be very accurately called an expansion of Mool Mantra and 
          Gurmantra. Here is a brief meaning of the Mool Mantra:</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_o.gif" width="27" height="22">: 
          Pronounced <b>EkOnkar:</b> The Only One is everything. The letter &quot;O&quot; 
          here, represents everything. Guru Nanak used only a number (1) before 
          it to indicate God, the reality. He did not want to pollute the unity 
          in the reality by adding any man made words. If he did, it would not 
          be a 1 anymore! In The Tenth Body, in the form of Guru Gobind Singh, 
          two hundred years after Japji, Guru Nanak composed the Jaap Sahib, naming 
          several different aspects of this number (1). Only the One is the reality 
          in everything, the visible and the invisible.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SattNaam:</b> 
          In reality, He is the Naam. His real Name (Naam) is He Himself. This 
          is the ultimate Truth. A Sikh's destination is His Name. A Sikh has 
          no reason to argue about which other name is correct. He uses the Hindu 
          names of Ram, Gobind, Shiva as well as Muslim Allah and Christian God, 
          etc., interchangeably and without hesitation because all these names 
          are equally provisional. This is why the Sikh Gurus chose &quot;Waheguru&quot; 
          as a closer match to God's name.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This leads to another 
          important understanding, that all the religions are also provisional. 
          They all become merely skeletal when the seeker reaches this fact: The 
          only proper Dharma is whatever God himself approves for each individual. 
          Only He can show us how we should worship Him. Books cannot teach it. 
          In the Sikh Panth, Gurbani is the only written word that can communicate 
          true Dharma in the spirit.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Karta:</b> He 
          is The Doer. He is the real creator and the real doer of everything, 
          though it may not be so obvious at first. Everything in the world is 
          like a puppet show. God is the puppet master behind everything. As Shri 
          Naranjan Singh Ji used to say, &quot;Even a single leaf cannot quiver 
          in the breeze without His Will.&quot; How does God do it? The Surat 
          can see this. This is worship. A Sikh is not to lose sight of the Puppet 
          Master behind all the various forms of puppets.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Purakh:</b> He 
          is The Husband. We may imagine God as an energy field or force (which 
          could be harnessed and used by anyone), a light (which can be directed, 
          controlled, or blocked, it has no will of its own), an emotion or a 
          feeling (which presumes someone other than itself experiencing it), 
          or, a space, a ghost, a cloud, a human, an animal, the list can go on 
          and on. None of these represent God. It is important that God is understood 
          as our Master, acting only by His own will which is completely fearless 
          and carefree, and who controls everything.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru Nanak called 
          Him, Husband, to foster a more accurate image of a Seeker's relationship 
          with Him. Sorry if this offends any females, or the males. If it is 
          any consolation, Guru Nanak has called Him as our Master, Father, Mother, 
          Brother, and Friend also. There is no question that He is also the real 
          Guru.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nirbhau:</b> 
          He has no fear, because He has only Love for everything He created, 
          and because there is nothing that is outside His control. His Will is 
          not influenced by some kind of threat, because He has no rival, or death, 
          to worry about. This is in contrast to theology where people believe 
          in God's battle with a rival who has fallen out of God's command.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nirvaer:</b> 
          He holds no grudge or hostility. We are all equally His Children. He 
          has only love and forgiveness for His Children. All we need is to become 
          receptive, ask Him sincerely, with a sincere desire to be correct. It 
          is us, who do not forgive ourselves. It is not in His nature to view, 
          and to dwell upon our mistakes. Only the ego carries a detailed and 
          a permanent record of everything we ever did. The ego, bound by the 
          law of Karma and Dharamraja, prescribes the rewards and penalties also. 
          He made the ego. Only He has the power to erase it.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Akaal:</b> He 
          is beyond time, and space. He made the time. He created the space. He 
          is Eternal. He has no limits. He is above all the law and the restrictions 
          of nature. He can do anything. He sees everything, in the past, the 
          present, and the future, as if it were here and now.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Moorat:</b> He 
          is still. He is motionless, He neither is coming from somewhere, nor 
          is he heading somewhere. He is everywhere. The universe in Him is constantly 
          in motion when he is perfectly still. How can this be? Only He can do 
          this. He is above His own laws. That is why we call Him God. He is the 
          creator of all motion, inside the stillness. He just is, always.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ajooni:</b> He 
          is the only one beyond birth and death. He does not have a life cycle. 
          He has no beginning or end. All entities at various godly levels (Brahma 
          etc.) are subject to falling back into the lowest life forms at any 
          moment. Only He holds the key for releasing a Jiva (life) from transmigration.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Saibhun:</b> 
          He is Existence. Everything is, because of God. He is self-effulgent 
          and Self-Sufficient. There is no one else out there, and there is no 
          such thing as &quot;outside Him.&quot; He is not here (or, everywhere) 
          because of someone or something else. Therefore, He is also in a state 
          of ultimate love, peace, and certitude, which is beyond human imagination.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>GurParshad:</b> 
          He is in Guru's Mercy (see Parshad above).</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Such:</b> I could 
          go on and on. I would like to just mention the fist stanza of Japji. 
          Japji starts with the command: &quot;Japa&quot; (Meditate), to meditate 
          on Truth. Next, Guru Nanak gives us the absolute test of Truth: &quot;Truth 
          always was before anything else, it has been here through the ages, 
          it is here now, and it will always be.&quot; Everything else, because 
          it does not pass this test, is not the Truth, and not worthy of meditation. 
          Whenever this word, Truth (&quot;Such&quot; in Gurmukhi, with a Gurmukhi 
          u at the end), is seen in Gurbani, the same yardstick is to be used, 
          so that we will understand its meaning in the proper context. When everything 
          visible and thinkable is gone, the Truth will still be the same.</font>
