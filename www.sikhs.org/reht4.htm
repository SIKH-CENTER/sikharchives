          of ancestors on appointed days as per the lunar calendar), ancestor 
          worship, khiah (ritual serving of food to priests - Brahmins - on the

          of food in the belief that that would satisfy the hunger of the departed 
          soul), diva (the ceremony of keeping an oil lamp lit for 360 days after 
          the death, in the belief that that lights the path of the deceased),

          the fulfillment of a purpose) jag (religious ceremony involving presentation 
          of oblations), tarpan (libation), sikha-sut (keeping a tuft of hair

          [Most, though not all rituals and ritual or religious observances listed 
          in this clause are Hindu rituals and observances. The reason is that 
          the old rituals and practices, continued to be observed by large numbers 
          of Sikhs even after their conversion from their old to the new faith 
          and a large bulk of the Sikh novices were Hindu converts. Another reason 
          for this phenomenon was the strangle-hold of the Brahmin priest on Hindus 
          secular and religious life which the Brahmin priest managed to maintain 
          even on those leaving the Hindu religious fold, by his astute mental 
          dexterity and rare capacity for compromise. That the Sikh novitiates 
          include a sizable number of Muslims is shown by inclusion in this clause 
          of the taboos as to the sanctity of graves, shirni, etc.]</font>

          congregation. Then the girl and boy should be made to sit facing the 
          Guru Granth Sahib. The girl should sit on the left side of the boy. 
          After soliciting the congregation's permission, the master of the marriage 
          ceremony (who may be a man or woman) should bid the boy and girl and

          commencement of the Anand marriage ceremony.</font>

          life according to the Gurus tenets.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He should initially 
          give to the two an exposition of their common mutual obligations. He 
          should tell them how to model the husband-wife relationship on the love 
          between the individual soul and the Supreme Soul in the light of the 
          contents of circumambulation (lavan) hymns in the Suhi measure (rag) 
          section of the Guru Granth Sahib.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He should explain 
          to them the notion of the state of "a single soul in two bodies" to 
          be achieved through love and make them see how they may attain union 
          with the Immortal Being discharging duties and obligations of the householders 
          life. Both of them, they should be told, have to make their conjugal 
          union a means to the fulfillment of the purpose of the journey of human 
          existence; both have to lead clean and Guru-oriented lives through the 
          instrumentality of their union.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He should then 
          explain to the boy and girl individually their respective conjugal duties 
          as husband and wife. The bridegroom should be told that the girl's people 
          having chosen him as the fittest match from among a whole lot, he should 
          regard his wife as his better half, accord to her unflinching love and 
          share with her all that he has. In all situations, he should protect 
          her person and honour, he should be completely loyal to her and he should 
          show as much respect and consideration for her parents and relations 
          as for his own.<br>
          The girl should be told that she has been joined in matrimony to her 
          man in the hallowed presence of the Guru Granth Sahib and the congregation. 
          She should ever harbour for him deferential solicitude, regard him the 
          lord and master of her love and trust; she should remain firm in her 
          loyalty to him and serve him in joy and sorrow and in every clime (native 
          or foreign) and should show the same regard and consideration to his 
          parents and relatives as she would, to her own parents and relatives.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The boy and girl 
          should bow before the Guru Granth Sahib to betoken their acceptance 
          of these instructions. Thereafter, the girl's father or the principal 
          relation should make the girl grasp one end of the sash which the boy 
          is wearing over his shoulders and the person in attendance of the Guru 
          Granth Sahib should recite the matrimonial circumambulation stanzas 
          (lavan of the fourth Guru in the Suhi musical measure section of the 
          Guru Granth). After the conclusion of the recitation of each of the 
          stanzas, the boy, followed by the girl holding the end of the sash, 
          should go round the Guru Granth Sahib while the ragis or the congregation 
          sing out the recited stanza.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The boy and girl, 
          after every circumambulation, should bow before the Guru Granth Sahib 
          in genuflexion, lowering their forehead to touch the ground and then 
          stand up to listen to the recitation of the next stanza. There being 
          four matrimonial circumambulation stanzas in the concerned hymn, the 
          proceeding will comprise four circumambulations with the incidental 
          singing of the stanza. After the fourth circumabulation, the boy and 
          girl should, after bowing before the Guru Granth Sahib, sit down at 
          the appointed place and the ragis or the person who has conducted the 
          ceremony should recite the first five and the last stanza of the Anand 
          Sahib. Thereafter, the Ardas should be offered to mark the conclusion 
          of the Anand marriage ceremony and the sacred pudding distributed.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (k) Persons professing 
          faiths other than the Sikh faith cannot be joined in wedlock by the

          parents at any time or on any occasion visit their daughter's home and 
          a meal is ready there, they should not hesitate to eat there. Abstaining 
          fromeating at the girl's home is a superstition. The Khalsa has been 
          blessed with the boon of victuals and making others eat by the Guru 
          and the Immortal Being. The girl's and boy's people should keep accepting 
          each other's hospitality, because the Guru has joined them in relationship 
          of equality.</font>

          be recited or "Waheguru, Waheguru" repeated by his/her side.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (b) When some one 
          shuffles the mortal coil, the survivors must not grieve or raise a hue 
          and cry or indulge in breast beating. To induce a mood of resignation 
          to God's will, it is desirable to recite Gurbani or repeat "Waheguru".</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (c) However young 
          and deceased may be, the body should be cremated. However, where arrangements 
          for cremation cannot be made, there should be no qualm about the body 
          being immersed in flowing water or disposed of in any other manner.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (d) As to the time 
          of cremation, no consideration as to whether it should take place during 
          day or night should weigh.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (e) The dead body 
          should be bathed and clothed in clean clothes. While that is done, the 
          Sikh symbols - comb, kachha, karha, kirpan - should not be taken off. 
          Thereafter, putting the body on a plank, Ardas about its being taken 
          away for disposal be offered. The hearse should then be lifted and taken 
          to the cremation ground, hymns that induce feeling of detachment should 
          be recited. On reaching the cremation ground, the pyre should be laid. 
          Then the Ardas for consigning the body to fire be offered. the dead 
          body should then be placed on the pyre and the son or any other relation 
          or friend of the deceased should set fire to it. The accompanying congregation 
          should sit at a reasonable distance and listen to kirtan or carry on 
          collective singing of hymns or recitation of detachment-inducing hymns. 
          When the pyre is fully aflame, the Kirtan Sohila (prescribed pre-retirement 
          night Scriptural prayer) be recited and the Ardas offered. (Piercing 
          the Skull half and hour or so after the pyre has been burning with a 
          rod or something else in the belief that that will secure the release 
          of the soul - kapal kriya - is contrary to the Guru's tenets). The congregation 
          should then leave. Coming back home, a reading of the Guru Granth Sahib 
          should be commenced at home or in a nearby gurduwara, and after reciting 
          the six stanzas of the Anand Sahib, the Ardas, offered and karhah prashad 
          (sacred pudding) distributed. The reading of the Guru Granth Sahib should 
          be completed on the tenth day. If the reading cannot, or is sought not 
          to, be completed on the tenth day, some other day may be appointed for 
          the conclusion of the reading having regard to the convenience of the 
          relatives. The reading of the Guru Granth Sahib should be carried out 
          by the members of the household of the deceased and relatives in cooperation. 
          If possible, Kirtan may be held every night. No funeral ceremony remains 
          to be performed after the "tenth day".</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (f) When the pyre 
          is burnt out, the whole bulk of the ashes, including the burnt bones, 
          should be gathered up and immersed in flowing water or buried at that 
          very place and the ground leveled. Raising a monument to the memory 
          of the deceased at the place where his dead body is cremated is taboo.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (g) Adh marg (the 
          ceremony of breaking the pot used for bathing the dead body amid doleful 
          cries half way towards the cremation ground), organized lamentation 
          by women, foorhi (sitting on a straw mat in mourning for a certain period), 
          diva (keeping an oil lamp lit for 360 days after the death in the belief 
          that that will light the path of the deceased), pind (ritual donating 
          of lumps of rice flour, oat flour, or solidified milk (khoa) for ten 
          days after death), kirya (concluding the funeral proceedings ritualistically, 
          serving meals and making offerings by way of shradh, budha marna (waving 
          of whisk, over the hearse of an old person's dead body and decorating 
          the hearse with festoons), etc. are contrary to the approved code. So 
          too is the picking of the burnt bones from the ashes of the pyre for 
          immersing in the Ganga, at Patalpuri (at Kiratpur), at Kartarpur Sahib 
          or at any other such place.</font>

          into a new house, setting up a new business (shop), putting a child 
          to school, etc., a Sikh should pray for God's help by performing the 
          Ardas. The essential components of all rites and ceremonies in Sikhism 
          are the recitation of the Gurbani (Sikh Scriptures) and the performing
