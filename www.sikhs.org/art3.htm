        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A powerful question 
          it is, and a very personal one for many Sikhs who have been living in 
          foreign countries, such as England, USA and Canada. Many if not all 
          who have been raised, or nearly raised their entire life in these countries, 
          must have asked the same question that I have, over and over, why am 
          I a Sikh?. Why do I follow the Sikh religious beliefs? and most importantly, 
          what is it to be a Sikh?</font>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I have lived 21 
          of my 24 years in Toronto and like most Sikhs who maintained unshorn 
          hair, have been harshly ridiculed, had to fight physical and verbal 
          battles with my school mates almost every day. Just trying to survive 
          in this white-dominated culture where children were out rightly racist, 
          was a tough daily battle. The only thing that kept me strong at heart, 
          was hearing the stories my father used to read to us all, of the lives 
          of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, his children and other Sikh Martyrs who gave 
          all for their faith in Sikhism. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Though I was still 
          young and didn't understand the details of Sikh values at that time, 
          just having role models like Guru Gobind Singh Ji' young children (Baba 
          Zorawar Singh and Baba Fateh Singh) kept my spirits alive and allowed 
          me to pass through this most critical time in my life as a youngster 
          with a strong sense that Sikhs were brave, strong, courageous and that 
          we would give our life, but stand tall like warriors and face all obstacles.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Today the racism 
          has decreased many fold since the 1970s and early 80s when I was in 
          public school, however it is still very real and visible to Sikh boys 
          who maintain their long hair. They endure the same subtle discrimination 
          by their class mates. The only difference being, it is less physical 
          nowadays.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The last few years, 
          since entering University I have asked myself many difficult questions 
          such as, would life not be easier if I just adopted the norm of today's 
          society? by cutting my hair, drinking alcohol, smoking, hanging around 
          in bars and partying?!</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I had to fight 
          an inner battle, the reason being that I knew much of what Sikh values 
          were and what a Sikh should be doing, but did not see it in practice 
          in society. The attitude if 'no one else cares, then why should I'? 
          was prevalent for a short period of time in me. In my eyes Sikhs were 
          no longer Sikhs. They might have been born into a Sikh family, but they 
          did not practice what my concept of Sikhi was. Doing your prayers, trying 
          to understand Gurbani, keeping long unshorn hair, not drinking, smoking, 
          sleeping around, having inter-religious affairs and so on. These were 
          not Sikh behaviors to me, but western values which Sikhs were endorsing 
          full heartily and still are doing.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I am no exception, 
          I to when the time came, got into a relationship with a Hindu girl, 
          and would love to have married her, but circumstances did not allow 
          it. The last year has been the most craziest of my life. For some unknown 
          reasons to me, a Muslim girl came into my life. This was the most challenging 
          time of my entire life. The reason being, I loved her and she loved 
          me, however, I could never marry her unless I convert to Islam she said.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now what is a 23 
          year old, warm blooded Sikh to do? I love her, but at the same time, 
          I knew my Gurus, their children, the many other Martyrs gave their life, 
          but did not accept Islam. Should I betray their sacrifices? for LOVE?</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I was so confused, 
          why did she not say such before coming into my life, &quot;that she can only 
          marry a Muslim&quot;? Why after taking my heart did she throw this piercing 
          thorn into our relationship? However when I reflected, I knew I had 
          strayed away from the Sikh values, and if I wanted to maintain Sikh 
          values, I would have to give her up, or she would have to convert to 
          Sikhism.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I asked myself 
          why did my Gurus sacrificed their lives for Sikhism? It must be truly 
          the greatest religion? Why did they ignore all the riches of the world, 
          the pleasures of society? of women? but emersed themselves in the love 
          of God? </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This period was 
          the most testing in my life. If I had not known about Sikhism, I would 
          have probably &quot;jumped the gun&quot; so to speak and married her by converting 
          to Islam. However when I looked into what Sikhism is, what are its values, 
          what is its history, I knew I would be doing a grave injustice not only 
          to my Gurus, but my own soul, for forsaking the most humanly religion 
          in the entire world. Most poetic, most respecting of all other religions, 
          and foremost, only religion in the entire world, where Sikhs have sacrificed 
          their lives to help save another religion. The ninth, Guru Teg Bahadur 
          Ji, just one prime example. How can I betray this worldly religion, 
          which respects all humans, does not enforce itself on anyone, respects 
          all religions alike, for humanly pleasure? I didn't. I couldn't. Blessed 
          with the understanding of my faith. I never would. My love left, but 
          my faith remained.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I wrote her the 
          following poem to depict to her my reasoning, my feelings, for my decision...</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> She asked from 
          me, my heart in love,<br>
          I gave her my treasures- heart, body and soul.<br>
          Unsatisfied was she, requesting my identity<br>
          I could only offer her my life, not birth!</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I shall not forsake 
          my blessings at birth<br>
          a religion of love, in blood poetically wrote.<br>
          Equality its emblem, crowned by selfless sacrifice<br>
          a religion offering peace, justice to humanity.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A religion not 
          elitist, nor condemning anyone<br>
          joining humankind as beloved children of God.<br>
          A religion stressing Truth (God), not blind following<br>
          spreading rays of happiness, not endless tyranny.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Why do you ask 
          me to relinquish this path?<br>
          do you not want to be my partner, equal in all respect?<br>
          My &quot;Love&quot;, I tell you, my heart I will burn,<br>
          shall die as a Kaffir, in God's love, over and over. </font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jas. Aug,17, 95. </font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I sacrificed love 
          for a human, for the love of my Guru. I could not betray my Guru, who 
          holds the wisdom, the light, the key, to ferry me across this worldly 
          ocean, to give me the true nectar bliss of God' love, to bring me closer 
          to my essence of whom I am, my spirit, my soul, for anything or anyone 
          in this world. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font> </p>
