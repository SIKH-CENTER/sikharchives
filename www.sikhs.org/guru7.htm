          <p><img src="images\guru7.jpg" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru 
          Har Rai was born on January 16, 1630 in Kiratpur to Baba Gurditta the 
          eldest son of Guru Hargobind. From a very young age he exhibited a sensitivity 
          to all living things and endeared himself to his grandfather Guru Hargobind. 
          One day while young Har Rai was returning home he got off his horse 
          upon seeing Guru Hargobind and in his hurry his robe got caught in a 
          bush and some flowers were broken from their stems. It is said that 
          it pained Har Rai's heart so much that he started crying. At the age 
          of 14 after having received suitable training Har Rai was invested with 
          the Guruship by his grandfather Guru Hargobind shortly before his death 
          in March 1644. Like Guru Hargobind, Guru Har Rai kept a contingent of 
          2,200 cavalry as his personal guard. After the many battles of Guru 
          Hargobind, the times of Guru Har Rai were a time of consolidation for 
          the Sikh community without any major battles in the Gurus lifetime. 
          </font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Guru was fond 
          of hunting but due to his sensitive nature he would not kill the animals 
          but keep them as pets in his zoo. Once while in the forest the Guru 
          came upon a large snake basking in the sunlight. Pointing to it, Guru 
          Har Rai exclaimed, "This serpent might as well have been a pundit in 
          his previous life; beautiful to behold in his dress, but the knowledge 
          he has is to bite. Men also bite others through jealousy; even when 
          they teach about God it is not through love or self-surrender, but through 
          the sharp wits and poisonous fangs of controversy and argument." Guru 
          Har Rai spent his life at his birthplace of Kiratpur. Guru Har Rai would 
          spend the mornings and evenings listening to devotional music and giving 
          lectures on the writings of the Gurus. The Guru would also eat simple 
          food which was earned by the labour of his own hands. Followers from 
          far would come to Kiratpur to seek the blessings of Guru Har Rai. The 
          Guru continued to spread the message of Sikhism. He sent Bhagwan Gir 
          to eastern India to preach Sikhism. Another disciple Bhai Pheru was 
          sent to Rajasthan and Suthre Shah was appointed to Delhi.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When mughal emperor 
          Shah Jehan's eldest son Dara Shikoh was seriously ill, Guru Har Rai 
          sent a herbal medicine which cured him. Thus relations with the mughals 
          remained on a good footing for a short time. There was eventual unstability 
          in the Delhi royal court when Shah Jehan fell ill and his second son 
          Aurangzeb aligned himself with his youngest brother Murad against their 
          eldest brother Dara Shikoh, Shah Jehan's approved successor. Aurangzeb 
          imprisoned his father in Agra and his soldiers as well as those of his 
          youngest brother Murad forces Dara Shikoh to flee towards Punjab. Guru 
          Har Rai was visiting Goindwal in June 1558 and here he met Dara Shikoh 
          who had come to receive his blessings. Dara Shikoh remembered that the 
          Guru had been responsible for saving his life when he was sick. Dara 
          Shikoh was both an intellectual and liberally tolerant towards other 
          religions. He was a great admirer of the muslim Sufi Saint Mian Mir 
          who was in turn a great admirer of the Gurus. Guru Har Rai granted Dara 
          Shikoh an audience and received the prince with due courtesy. After 
          some time Dara Shikoh was eventually captured by the forces of Aurangzeb. 
          Aurangzeb had Dara Shikoh executed, then killed his own youngest brother 
          Murad and appointed himself as the emperor.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> With such a ruthless 
          person on the throne in Delhi, relations with the Sikhs would never 
          be the same during Aurangzeb's long reign. Once settled into the throne, 
          Aurangzeb turned his attention to the new faith, Sikhism. It was reported 
          to the emperor that Guru Har Rai has had blessed Dara Shikoh and assisted 
          his escape. Aurangzeb ordered the Guru to appear in the royal court 
          of Delhi. Guru Har Rai did not go himself but instead sent his son Ram 
          Rai to meet the emperor. Before leaving Ram Rai was instructed by his 
          father to not engage in any miracles and to not allow the teaching of 
          the Sikhs to be compromised in any way. When Ram Rai presented himself 
          before the royal court he was able to impress Aurangzeb with his intellect 
          and charm that Sikhism did not present any threat to the Mughals. Aurangzeb 
          took exeption to a verse in the Guru Granth Sahib;</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"God alone knows 
          who burns in hell (the Hindu or the Muslim), for (like the Hindus whom 
          fire consumes here), the earth of the Muslim graves also suffers being 
          fired by the potter who fashions bricks and vessels out of its clay." 
          (Guru Nanak, Asa Var)</i></font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ram Rai explained 
          to Aurangzeb that the words of Guru Nanak had been incorrectly written 
          by the scribe, and that the word was not "Muslim" but "Baiman" (meaning 
          faithless). By intentionally changing the words of Guru Nanak, Ram Rai 
          was able to gain the emperors friendship. When it was reported back 
          to Guru Har Rai what his son had done, he was deeply hurt. The Guru 
          exclaimed, "Ram Rai was a genuine claimant for my throne. But the Guruship 
          is like the milk of a tigress which can only be contained in a cup of 
          gold. Now Ram Rai shall never see my face again." Ram Rai never saw 
          his father again but maintained his friendship with Aurangzeb.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Since Ram Rai had 
          proved a disappointment to his father, Guru Har Rai appointed his younger 
          son Harkrishan as the next Guru and passed away soon thereafter on October 
          6, 1661. </font>
