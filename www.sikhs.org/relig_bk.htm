          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sikh Guru's 
          and the Bhakti movement shared many similarities as well as a number 
          of differences. Sikhism should not be looked at as simply an extension 
          of the Bhakti movement but as a new movement entirely. While the Bhagat's 
          shared some of the same beliefs as those expressed by the Guru's, the 
          Bhagats were not able to make a clear break from their religious heritage. 
          The Sikh Guru's on the other hand were able to make that clean break 
          to form a new religion which grew and has survived the test of time, 
          unlike many of the Bhakti reform movements which did not. Sikhs consider 
          the works of the various Bhagats in Sri Guru Granth Sahib as being equal 
          to the writings of the Guru's themselves and as such, deserving of the 
          same respect and reverance.</font> </p>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> Bhagat Kabir regarded the world and life as suffering and welcomed death 
        as the beginning of a blissful existence. The Gurus believed you can achieve 
        blissful mukhti while alive and do not have to wait for death. </font>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> Bhagat Kabir believed that either one should become a householder and 
            do good actions or he should become a Vairagi and renounce the world. 
            Guru Nanak believed only in the path of the householder.</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> Kabir was a strict vegetarian and strongly believed in the doctrine 
            of Ahinsa, non destruction of any life; man, animal or even a flower. 
            The Sikh Guru's did not believe in this Hindu practice.</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> Bhagat Ravi Das believed in a physical heaven, while the Sikh Gurus 
            did not believe in a physical concept of heaven. The Sikh heaven is 
            to merge and become one with God.</font> </p>
