          <h3>The Common Sikh</h3>
          
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most people born 
          in the Sikh households are indifferent toward the Sikh teachings. They 
          visit the Sikh places of worship, on special occasions or every weekend, 
          because of tradition, for social reasons, or to pray for favors. They 
          do not have a desire to understand the Sikh teaching. Until they reach 
          some awakening, they are no different than the similar masses in any 
          other faith. Many believe they are &quot;Sikh&quot; because they go 
          to a Gurudwara, they pray (whenever they have a problem) only &quot;to 
          the Sikh Gurus or Guru Granth Sahib,&quot; and to no one else. Others 
          think they are Sikh because they are strict in keeping the &quot;Five 
          Ks.&quot; But, these do not fulfil the features of a Sikh. It simply 
          adds to the number of people who can argue or fight on behalf of the 
          Sikhs without a valid knowledge of the Sikh Guru's teaching. They do 
          not represent the Sikh Panth. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some people differ 
          from the above because of their sentiments and desire. They have an 
          interest in learning these teachings, but they lack the understanding, 
          motivation, or courage to follow them completely, and they cannot maintain 
          a Sikh appearance. We can see that many work harder for the Sikh causes. 
          They may possess a stronger faith, morality and honesty than some others 
          with full hair and a turban. However, they do not represent the Sikh 
          Panth either. These poor souls stand out as the only &quot;dissidents&quot;, 
          because they are visible! A niche, proper help and support for these 
          people, is painfully lacking in the Sikh society today. Often, due to 
          our spiritual and emotional attachment with the appearance of The Tenth 
          Master, we give more respect to people with hair, regardless of their 
          character. This makes us appear as if we condone hypocrisy.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikh Panth is the 
          only spiritual path in the entire world, where, preservation of natural 
          hair is an important and essential component of worship. The Sikhs look 
          different than everyone else. Therefore, they live mostly in a, however 
          tacit, social and political separation from the Non Sikhs. Sikhs have 
          no spiritual allies either. For this reason the Panth has required an 
          enormous sacrifice from its followers. Whenever there is an opportunity, 
          people have martyred the Sikhs in large numbers. This makes the Sikhs 
          stronger.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time, 
          Sikh Children and weak Sikhs suffer a tremendous psychological stress. 
          Being constantly bombarded with, suggestions and signals contrary to 
          their faith, extremely strong peer pressure and other forces of outer 
          society where, truancy, smoking, unrestrained sex, drugs, delinquency, 
          sensual &quot;music&quot;, as well as shaving and mutilation of hair, 
          is also the rule. People outside the Sikh faith cannot understand the 
          impact, and the conflict it causes in the Sikh households.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikh parents need 
          to keep this in view. We need to actively combat these forces in the 
          similar notes. At present, the Sikh society is very immature and naive 
          about it. Members in some Sikh households are forced to be Sikh against 
          their will. Forcing people against their own choice results in a society 
          of extremely maladjusted individuals. Rather, they should be encouraged 
          to follow by setting a good example of the Sikh family members in the 
          house. This will also motivate the devout Sikhs to be more diligent 
          themselves.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the time 
          of The Ten Masters, and until recently, the family members of most Punjabi 
          households were mixed as Sikh and Hindu. They all spoke mixed Punjabi. 
          They used to live together peacefully, along with the Muslim friends 
          as next door neighbors. Today, we need to develop viable alternatives 
          against the pressures of Non Sikh culture on the Sikh children. One 
          avenue would be to develop art, literature, and movies that would deeply 
          impress our children against the outside forces. Another important element 
          is to ensure that the Sikh children understand and participate in the 
          services at the Gurudwara. We need to engage them in an intelligent 
          discussion suited for their age, and not simply subject them to a fervent 
          preaching.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sikh Panth stands 
          only on faith in the Guru, and a sincere, spiritual worship in the ancient 
          tradition, while staying ready to sacrifice for the Guru and Dharma. 
          Lacking this, a Sikh turns into nothing but a spiritually disabled and 
          a morally weak character, with a barren life. Keeping a Sikh appearance 
          then becomes meaningless and, also very difficult. Various social maladies 
          crop up in the Sikh communities along with confusion and arguments in 
          the Gurudwaras, lacking the preservation of spirituality and ancient 
          tradition as their major goal. Just as a path without the hair cannot 
          be the Sikh Panth. Hair, turban, or a sword, without, love and adoration 
          for the Ten Masters, a true spiritual hunger, worship, humility, and 
          the proper Sikh conduct, becomes a mere disguise.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sects</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikh sects not respecting 
          the rules set by The Tenth Master could be, probably included here in 
          this hierarchy. Some examples: Offshoots of Sikh Panth with new names 
          and groups, for no particular reason. Influencing others with a display 
          of occult powers. Strange practices, for instance, hyperventilating 
          under the notion of Simran, rhythmic or circular body motions, causing 
          a sensation of self-hypnosis and euphoria. Teaching physical Yoga, or 
          some other exotic disciplines, as an integral part of the Sikh curriculum, 
          etc. Some of these sects have provided an example of the intensity and 
          motivation needed in the indolent masses noted above in this section. 
          They deserve praise for that part.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However well intentioned 
          these sects may be, if they do not adhere to the spiritual conduct and 
          practices the Ten Masters illustrated over the span of two hundred years, 
          they defeat the purpose of their sacrifice and their teaching. The Tenth 
          Master concluded this process with the final Sikh form, an established 
          Sikh way of worship, and the accepted Sikh lifestyle (Rehet-Maryada). 
          He did so, also, to prevent any future modification and resulting degradation, 
          for the coming generations. This is why The Tenth Master said, &quot;Whenever 
          a Khalsa abandons his uniqueness and adopts extraneous spiritual practices 
          and rituals of others, I will leave his company.&quot; (SLG, p.667)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Yoga</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Gurus did not 
          condemn Yoga. However, Yoga cannot be counted as a required ingredient 
          in what makes a Sikh. Anyone who disputes this should first examine 
          the history of the Ten Masters, or study the Gurbani, like, &quot;Paath 
          purrhio ur beid beechario...&quot; (SGGS, p.641-42). Just like hygiene, 
          regular exercise, balanced diet, vitamins, Yoga is an activity that 
          any sensible Sikh should explore and use, while being careful not to 
          become obsessed with the bodily functions. For instance, a vegetarian 
          diet, various simple forms of Pranayama, are very useful, and chastity 
          is essential, to enable one for the higher energy of the Shabad. Sikh 
          Path is liberal and progressive. The Gurus do not reject a healthy lifestyle 
          through proper use of any science. We all know that science is still 
          struggling to prove how accurately Guru Nanak described the universe 
          and biology in his verses, five hundred years ago.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gurbani supports 
          the concept of Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, Janana Yoga, and Raja Yoga. 
          Bhakti, Seva, and Nam, extensively cited in Gurbani, cover the first 
          three, not as Yoga but as a Gift, a consequence of God-Guru's Mercy. 
          This flows freely from a complete submission to a True Spiritual Master. 
          Yoga is, simply, a philosophical science. Like physical exercise, when 
          used sensibly, it can help build a body and mind that are better prepared 
          to receive, and share the spiritual energy with others. When practiced 
          without submission, just like practice of charity, it can, however subtly, 
          result in a stronger ego and thus keep us farther away from Truth. Raja 
          Yoga is mentioned favorably several times in Gurbani, because of the 
          supreme aim of Raja Yoga: As Patanjali said, &quot;Yoga is removal of 
          mind's noise. Then the observer can return to a view of the Self.&quot; 
          At the same time, Gurbani names various limbs and segments of Raja Yoga 
          as not conducive to Truth.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikh Panth, as shown 
          by the Ten Masters, leads to the ultimate truth through an inner death, 
          then living abundantly and spiritually through the Guru's command, breathing 
          only whatever the Guru allows. A Sikh, on the Panth, cannot bother with 
          attempts to open some Chakra (energy level) or any other experiences 
          related to different Chakras per se. Doing so, will divert him from 
          a higher aim, Pure Love, which is at the innermost seat of consciousness, 
          or should we say, at the highest energy level.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is the practical 
          outcome of, the perfect knowledge of Truth, at the Sahasrara Chakra? 
          Is it not Pure Love for the whole creation and a true humility toward 
          all humans? So, instead of taking detours, a Sikh does it naturally, 
          through Love and humility, from the Guru, devotional singing of Gurbani 
          with other devout Sikhs, and by quiet meditation on Gurmantra and Gurbani. 
          The Sikh rises above a preoccupation and identification with the body 
          and mind by &quot;selling&quot; it to the Guru in exchange for a perpetual 
          supply of (spiritual) Naam, engaging in extensive Seva (selfless service), 
          and following the Gurbani to the letter. This is also called Sehej Yoga, 
          or the Natural Yoga.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Gursikh is not 
          deprived of any esoteric body experiences, if that is his Guru's will. 
          If there is a need, the Inner Guide shows all the required disciplines. 
          They are practiced naturally by following the Guru's command, rather 
          than through a personal attachment with the body. Verbal details of 
          these practices are not intrinsic to the Panth. This is why Gurbani 
          does not dwell on this subject. For some, the direct way is too simple. 
          Many seekers are more inclined toward physical exercises and controlling 
          the energy, or holding a rather intellectually spiritual (Zen, for instance) 
          stance, than Simran in pure love and devotion, until, by God's Grace, 
          they witness Pure Love living in flesh. Still, they should clearly regard 
          all Yoga practices as what they really are, a separate science, not 
          as a requirement on the Sikh Path. Some will enjoy the honey, while 
          others study the honeycomb and practice various approaches to it first.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ninth Master, 
          Guru Teg Bahadur said: &quot;The Guru explains this secret: Without 
          Love of God, we cannot be free from fear, and the cycle of misery continues. 
          Pilgrimage, fasting, greatest charities, or Yoga, they are all useless 
          if we forget to praise God in whatever we do, and if we do not resort 
          to rely only on Him for all results. A rare soul gives up both - pride 
          (love of self) and co-dependence of family (love of others) - and then, 
          meditates only on Gobind. Nanak says that such a human is what they 
          call, free of birth and death while still living among us.&quot; (SGGS, 
          p.830-31)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ten Masters 
          have regarded meditation as essential. For example, The Tenth Master 
          said: &quot;Meditate on Him whose infinitely forceful light permeates 
          the whole world,&quot; and the Fifth Master said, in Sukhmani: &quot;My 
          dear saint friends, when you praise God, do it with an alert and one 
          pointed mind.&quot; It cannot be done unless we put some effort to practice 
          it every day as a routine exercise. This verse also signifies that being 
          'saintly' is not enough. This is why a mantra is given. Gurmantra is 
          a vehicle, a thread, only for meditation. Again, The Tenth Master says: 
          &quot;Meditating on Him, as the Single aim and thought, even for the 
          fraction of a second, has liberated humans from the noose of death.&quot;</font>
