        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">History tells us 
          that in the sixteenth century Ignatius Loyola decreed that henceforth 
          all priests of the Jesuit order must wear a collar. He also promulgated 
          a special code of conduct for the clergy. Why? Apparently, Ignatius 
          wanted to organize a special cadre of people devoted solely to serve 
          the church and its flock. He called it the &quot;army of Christ&quot;. This army 
          of shepherds was to guide and lead the flock of believers. The uniform 
          and the code defined the army. Those who joined this army pursued a 
          higher calling than the laity.</font>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> What was India 
          like around that time? A predominantly Hindu county, it was ruled by 
          Muslims. Hindu society had always been cast-ridden in which over half 
          the people were denied their humanity. For instance, the women and lower 
          castes could not read the holy scriptures and were denied access to 
          most professions and trades etc. In that society, food was deemed defiled 
          if the shadow of a lower caste person fell on it, and molten lead could 
          be poured into the ears of such a person should he hear the sacred scriptures. 
          Female infanticide was common and widows were routinely burnt at the 
          pyres of the dead husbands in a rite called suttee. The upper castes 
          were corrupt, the priests sold religious indulgences; the Brahmins were 
          little better than charlatans, the ticket sellers for a dubious passage 
          to heaven, but above all, the guardians of their own privileged lifestyles. 
          The people were powerless, under the heel either to their own corrupt 
          upper cast Brahmins or the ruling Muslims. The Muslims were intolerant 
          of other religions, and by special taxation and other humiliations, 
          waged a full scale effort to islamize India. For instance a non-Muslim 
          could not bear arms or ride a horse except by special permission and 
          paid special taxes for weddings and funerals.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> History also tells 
          us that on Baisakhi (around mid-April) 1699 the tenth Guru, Gobind, 
          appeared before a congregation of 80,000 at Anandpur in Punjab. He flashed 
          a naked sword and demanded a head. Some followers slipped away, many 
          looked away. What kind of a Guru asks his followers for such a sacrifice? 
          This Guru did, not once but five times. Each time, one Sikh stepped 
          forward.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> History also records 
          that from this modest beginning, Guru Gobind Singh created the mighty 
          Khalsa nation. He dubbed them &quot;lions&quot;, each equivalent to 125,000 ordinary 
          men; each a king among men or a princess. His Sikhs were to have the 
          valor of a lion and the grace of a princess. After he created his new 
          order, the Guru knelt and his first five converts in turn converted 
          him from Gobind Rai to Gobind Singh. By this act, he set himself, not 
          as a ruler of a nation or a General of an army, but another soldier 
          of the Khalsa. In this unique gesture, the leader acknowledged his debt 
          to his own people - every leader is so indebted but few remember.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This incident deserves 
          a special place in the annals of human history, management of large 
          organizations, corporate hierarchy and leadership training. It was a 
          rare process and technique to teach a downtrodden and powerless people 
          the idiom of empowerment and it turned India's feudal society on its 
          head. The lesson was not lost either on his Sikhs who cheerfully followed 
          Guru Gobind Singh through the hell of pain, suffering and war, nor was 
          it lost on the Hindu and Muslim elite of the society whose comfortable 
          thrones were rocked by the Sikhs and who declared perpetual war on the 
          Sikhs. I call this a perpetual war because even now three hundred years 
          later in the twentieth century, India's feudal, Brahminical ruling classes 
          resent the assertive sense of self and of power that the Guru bestowed 
          upon his Sikhs. And therein lie the roots of the Sikh struggle for autonomy 
          in India today.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> History also tells 
          us that where his followers had offered their heads, Guru Gobind Singh 
          did not lag behind. He led his soldiers like a good General, not from 
          a comfortable bunker but by being alongside them. He laid on the line 
          not only all of his worldly possessions but also his family including 
          minor children and ultimately his own life as well. He looked at the 
          miracle of his creation of the Khalsa and attributed it to the Khalsa, 
          without pride or conceit. God's work was done, he said. He gave his 
          Khalsa a special code of conduct, a specific uniform, and distinctive 
          symbols.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Khalsa was destined 
          to be an army of winners, fearless and pure, in service to God and Man, 
          in pursuit of righteousness. Unlike Ignatious Loyola's army, this &quot;pride 
          of lions&quot; of Sikhs was to have no professional clergy, nor were there 
          to be any sheep or shepherds. In this nation of soldiers of God, there 
          were to be none who were more equal than others. Henceforth, every Sikh 
          who was a Singh or Kaur was to be in uniform as a soldier. There were 
          to be no higher calling for some and not for others, as Loyola had envisioned. 
          The code of conduct applied equally to all, including the Guru and he 
          himself remained answerable to the directives of his Khalsa.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Gobind Singh 
          created the Khalsa but the foundation stone had been laid by the iconoclast 
          Nanak who challenged authority most-boldly and by his followers who 
          were martyred for the right to live with dignity. Guru Nanak found a 
          demoralized nation of jackasses but by his teaching and by the examples 
          of his followers, the spark of self-respect was lit; the process of 
          transformation of a jackass into a lion had begun. Two hundred years 
          later, by the time of Guru Gobind Singh, it was time to awaken the sleeping 
          lion; the jackass had been metamorphosed. Only then did Guru Gobind 
          Singh give the lion a new uniform and a code of conduct.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Gobind Singh 
          created an egalitarian order but for the ordinary follower he did not 
          make the job any easier. If there is no clergy with binding ecclesiastical 
          authority, then each Sikh has to cultivate and heed his own conscience. 
          Each Sikh must hone his own intellect and plumb the depths of his own 
          faith. Guru Gobind Singh recognized that each one of us has a constant 
          battle to fight and the enemies are not necessarily out there. In all 
          the battles of life that must be fought, no battlefield is more important 
          than that of the mind. On that Baisakhi day three hundred years ago, 
          Guru Gobind Singh staged the lesson of life: In everything you do and 
          in each moment of your life, live honestly and so that you can put your 
          head on the line. In whatever you do, do it so that you can live and 
          die with dignity.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now three hundred 
          years after Guru Gobind Singh, is there anyone asking for a head?</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When a business 
          associate suggests that a little greasing of the palm could smooth the 
          way for your project or when a prospective employer hints that a job 
          or a promotion could be yours if you appear without your Sikh uniform, 
          why should you resist? If the road you take is less than straight and 
          narrow, why does it matter? If social life could be easier without the 
          long hair or the Sikh uniform, why not take the easy road? Why look 
          to the road less traveled by? Haven't times changed? Guru Gobind Singh 
          is not asking for heads now, or is he?</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Yes, three hundred 
          years have passed. Guru Gobind Singh no longer appears in person at 
          the job interview, flashing a naked sword and asking for your head. 
          Mysterious are the ways of the Guru and many are the people that he 
          uses as his instruments. Now the question is framed differently, the 
          flashing sword is replaced by the prospect of social isolation, economic 
          disaster or harassment at the job or in the neighborhood. The instrument 
          of the Guru is the affable man or woman behind the desk asking all these 
          awkward questions. The instrument of the Guru may be the nice person 
          having a cup of coffee or pleasant conversation with you. The intent 
          of the questions is the same, only the form is different. The question 
          is asked a hundred times a day and in a myriad ways. Three hundred years 
          later, once again the Guru wants your head. Many will slip away, just 
          as they did three hundred years ago. Many more will look away, just 
          as they did then.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The question is: 
          How are you going to answer the call?</font> </p>
