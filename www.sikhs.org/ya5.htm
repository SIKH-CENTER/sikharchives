          <h3>The Sikh</h3>
   
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sikh, a disciple 
          on the Sikh Path, regards Guru Granth Sahib as the supreme source of 
          spiritual light. A Sikh evaluates all other religious literature in 
          the light of Guru Granth Sahib, and not vice versa. He endeavors to 
          understand all Ten Sikh Gurus' teachings. He sees no difference in Guru 
          Nanak and the other Nine Masters. He does not follow any other human 
          guru after Guru Gobind Singh, The Tenth Master. He strives to put the 
          Gurus' teaching constantly into practice, every day. These are some 
          features that make a Sikh. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Word</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I will limit the 
          discussion of Sikh philosophy and a Sikh's daily spiritual practices 
          to a brief explanation of some Sikh vocabulary below. The Gurbani, in 
          Guru Granth Sahib is God's view of a true Seeker's sentiments, his actions, 
          his motives, and his prayers, during different aspects of his spiritual 
          growth, flavored with the Guru's teaching. A Sikh meditates on it, repeats 
          it daily, and sings it, so that day by day, its sentiments and its Light 
          rub off, into his heart. Sharing it with others (Sangat) through singing 
          (Kirtan) and discussion (Katha) is essential to reveal its Light. These 
          are required. They are potent catalysts. One day, the Sikh's heart starts 
          beating in sync with the Guru's heart. No one can venture to describe 
          what happens then. A seeker should not talk about his own relationship 
          with the Guru and God. In the Sikh Path, testimony of personal experiences 
          is equal to blasphemy, because it feeds the ego!</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru Nanak brought 
          an activity of the angels of heaven, as mentioned in Sodar (in Japji 
          and Reheras) within the grasp of the modern masses, five hundred years 
          ago. Gurbani was written in verse, according to the ancient Indian music 
          (raga), to ensure that it will be sung. Singing God's True Words, with 
          others joined for the same purpose, facilitates mind's flight to the 
          region of spiritual knowledge. This is called Kirtan. Gurbani, unlike 
          some other poetry, is alive with the Spirit. When sung in a congregation 
          of two or more Sikhs, with adoration and attention (Sat Sangat), especially 
          at or before daybreak, it is able to uplift all the participants to 
          the level of Begumpura (Lord's Town). Real guidance and knowledge, not 
          restricted by words, are found there. A Sikh considers this as the most 
          appropriate spiritual activity, for the masses of today.<br>
          In the Sikh Panth, home made verses, or verses written by some other 
          'guru' besides The Ten Masters, however devotional and uplifting - do 
          not replace Gurbani. A translation of Gurbani is useful to understand 
          it, but the original verse is lost in the translation. Only the original 
          sound, with accurate pronunciation, is acceptable as the holy singing 
          of Gurbani. A Sikh does his best to fulfil this condition. To emphasize 
          that it did not belong to any particular group, the Gurus wrote the 
          Gurbani in several languages but they did not always follow the rules 
          of these languages. This made Gurbani a unique language. Gurbani has 
          its own unique grammar. For the same reason, the Second Master, Guru 
          Angad, created the Guru's way of writing Gurbani (Gurmukhi), as different 
          from all other forms of the alphabet. Learning Gurmukhi is not any harder 
          than learning to recognize an alphabet and its few simple rules. This 
          alphabet is now, also used in writing Punjabi, the contemporary language 
          of Punjab.<br>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Lifestyle</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Sikh is expected 
          to get married and be an ideal householder, husband, father, doctor, 
          carpenter, etc., not to be a monk and live off others. He is to live 
          in the world physically, mix with the society and not run away from 
          it, but his heart is to be set on God. Disrespect of parents and elders, 
          adultery, falsehood, slander, careless use of, or an addiction to, drugs 
          and other intoxicating substances, accepting the worship offerings for 
          personal use, exploitation of the poor, excessive sleep, excessive eating, 
          excessive talk, and disrespect of hair, is prohibited for a Sikh. Guru 
          Nanak said to Guru Angad that the hair (and turban) is his mark. The 
          Gurus have also said that appearance alone is not enough! A Sikh is 
          also prohibited from touching the &quot;Sewer of the World,&quot; i.e., 
          tobacco, and from eating meat of animals killed through slow torture, 
          under some religious ritual.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Sikh, who ignores 
          meditation, is like a bird without feathers. The Fourth Master wrote: 
          &quot;Whoever calls himself a Sikh of the True Guru, will wake up in 
          the ambrosial hours and meditate on God's Name. He gets rid of sloth 
          and practices Ishnan, to immerse himself in the Waters of Immortality. 
          By obeying the Guru's teaching he learns how to meditate on God's Name. 
          This results in cleansing of poison from iniquity, sins, and faults. 
          Upon daybreak, he sings Gurbani, and holds God's Name in heart during 
          all activity. A Gursikh, who worships my God with each breath and bite, 
          is really liked by the Guru. Whenever my Master has mercy, the Guru 
          conveys His spiritual teaching to that Gursikh. Nanak begs for the enlightening 
          dust, from that Gursikh' feet, who practices Nam and helps others do 
          the same.&quot;(SGGS, p.305-6)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyone, despite 
          his or her personal views, can participate in generating peace and goodness 
          in his own life and in this world, by doing at least this:</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wake up before dawn 
          every day. Rinse hands, face, and mouth. Sit (Stand or kneel) for five-ten 
          minutes in prayer and thankfulness of an entity that is infinitely greater 
          than you. Thank Him (Her or It) who: Is with you all the time, is infinitely 
          more able and intelligent than you are, gave you everything you have, 
          knows all your thoughts needs and desires, loves you regardless because 
          you are His child, and forgives you every time you sincerely ask for 
          it. Mentally, send peace and harmony to all your brothers and sisters 
          in the world, especially those that bother you. Forgive them also. Now, 
          resolve to be polite and generous to everyone freely and without reason, 
          especially the lowly, because of this higher entity hidden inside everyone, 
          especially the so called lowly. You can rest again, afterwards. All 
          day, whenever you remember, remind yourself of this hidden entity, you 
          talked with, this morning. You are, now, planting seeds of goodness 
          in the universe. Watch it blossom in your life each day.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some will argue, 
          why not simply be charitable, run soup kitchens and shelters, help the 
          poor and the sick, feed the hungry children? Charity is very important. 
          It is good for the world as well as for the self-esteem. However, without 
          being linked with a heartfelt supplication to God, it results in a stronger, 
          though glorified, ego, and thus, it can become bad for the soul. On 
          the path to ultimate truth, the correct form of charity is Seva (Selfless 
          service) through submission to a True Master, combined with some form 
          of worship and humility. The above is just one example of worship. This 
          is essential.</font>
