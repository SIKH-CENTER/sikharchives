          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   
        
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, I 
          would like to quote some words of Shri Naranjan Singh Ji. They are similar 
          to what Dr. Harcharanjit Singh wrote in the book, &quot;Divine Mystic 
          Reflections on Gurmat&quot; (a record of His Holiness' words): </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The word 'religion' 
          is a western term. The eastern word, Dharma, simply means duty. The 
          Fifth Master, Guru Arjan Ji has said in his Gurbani of Sukhmani 
          Sahib: 'Of all religions (Dharma), the best one is, to utter sincerely 
          the Name of God; this is the most pious work.' That is, the foremost 
          of all religions is the religion of remembering the Lord and having 
          pure thought and action. Religion abides in every soul. It is the innermost 
          nature of everything that exists. It is the yearning of man to be perfect. 
          There is only one religion: Of the droplet of water to become the ocean; 
          of the incomplete man to become complete; and of a flame to merge with 
          the fire. Even without knowing it, we are all moving towards that perfection
