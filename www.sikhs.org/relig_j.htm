          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jainism was completely 
          rejected by the Gurus. It preaches a life of the ascetic combined with 
          extreme Ahinsa (non injury to any living being) as well as a very unhygienic 
          lifestyle.</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;They have their 
            heads plucked, drink dirty water and repeatedly beg and eat other's 
            leavings. They spread out ordure, with their mouths, suck its ordure 
            and dread to look at water. With hands smeared with ashes, they have 
            their heads plucked like sheep. The daily routine of their mothers and 
            fathers they give up, and their kith and kin bewail loudly. For them 
            none gives barley rolls and food on leaves, nor performs last rites, 
            nor lights earthen lamp. After death where shall they be cast? The sixty-eight 
            places of pilgrimage grant them no refuge, and Pandits eat not their 
            food. They ever remain filthy day and night, and bear not sacrificial 
            marks on their brow. They ever sit in groups, as if mourning and go 
            not into the True Court. With begging bowls slung round their loins 
            and a clew in their hands, they walk in single file. They are neither 
            disciples of Gorakh nor adorers of Shiva, nor Muslim Qazis and Mullah's.&quot; 
            (Guru Nanak, Slok, pg. 149)</i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i></i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i></i></font><i></i> </p>
