          The Golden Temple, Amritsar</font></b> <br>
          <img src="images\golden0b.jpg" width="127" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Darbar Sahib (The Royal Court of the Divine) also known as the 
          Golden Temple is situated in the 
          city of Amritsar in Punjab. Darbar Sahib is a living symbol of 
          the spiritual and historical traditions of the Sikhs. It is a source 
          of inspiration for all Sikhs. The 
          temple with it's glistening gold covered exterior stands in the middle 
          of a square tank with each side about 150m with an 18m path on all four 
          sides. A 60m causeway traverses the pool to reach the Temple itself 
          which is 12m square and rests on a 20m square platform in the middle 
          of The Pool of Nectar. The Darbar Sahib has entrances and doors 
          on all four sides. Guru Arjun exclaimed; "My faith is for the people 
          of all castes and all creeds from whichever direction they come and 
          to whichever direction they bow." </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Amar Das the 
          Third Sikh Guru asked Ram Das (who would go on to become the Fourth 
          Sikh Guru) to build a central place of congregation for the Sikhs. Guru 
          Ram Das started excavation work in 1577 during his lifetime. Guru Arjun 
          the Fifth Sikh Guru completed excavation of the Tank known as Amritsar 
          (The Pool of Nectar) in 1588. Guru Arjun then started construction 
          of the Temple building itself which was finally completed in 1601. The 
          first edition of the Holy Book of the Sikh's The Guru Granth Sahib was 
          installed there in 1604 with Baba Buddha as the first granthi (caretaker 
          of the book). The last Sikh Guru to live in Amritsar was the Sixth Guru, 
          Guru Hargobind. In 1664 Guru Tegh Bahadur the Ninth Sikh Guru visited 
          Darbar Sahib but was refused entry by the corrupt temple caretakers, 
          The Masands. Darbar Sahib has always been a rallying point for 
          Sikhs throughout it's history. Around 1740 Massa Ranghar, the ruler 
          of Amritsar desecrated <a href="golden\index.htm"></a>the 
          Temple by using it as a dancing hall. He was killed by Mahtab Singh. 
          In 1761 Ahmed Shah Abdali blew up the Temple and filled in the Sacred 
          Tank with refuse. The great Sikh martyr Baba Deep Singh laid down his 
          life in revenge. The construction of the Golden Temple as it appears 
          today was begun in 1764 when Jassa Singh Ahluwalia laid the foundation 
          stone. Many of the doors and domes were covered with copper sheets overlaid 
          with gold during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Darbar Sahib
          was partially damaged by the military invasion of the Indian Army during 
        June 1984.</font>

            <b><font size="3">The Five Holy Takhts:</font></b><br>
          These Five Gurdwaras known as the Five Takhts (Thrones) have a very 
          special significance for the Sikh community. They are considered the 
          seats of Sikh religious authority. Many important decisions concerning 
          the religious and social life of the Sikh community were made here.

            Takht literally means Eternal Throne. It is part of the Golden Temple 
            complex in Amritsar. The Akal Takht is situated on the other end of 
            the causeway connected to the Harmandir Sahib. It's foundation was laid 
            by Guru Hargobind. It was here that he was ceremonially installed as 
            Guru in 1606. The building of the Akal Takht opposite the Golden Temple 
            has a special meaning. While the Golden Temple stands for spiritual 
            guidance the Akal Takht symbolizes the dispensing of justice and temporal 
            activity. During the day the Guru Granth Sahib is kept in the Golden 
            Temple, while at night it is kept in the Akal Takht. Traditionally all 
            Sikh warriors sought blessings here before going to battle. During the 
            18th century while Sikhs were fighting a guerrilla war in the forests 
            they used to gather at the Akal Takht on special occasions such as Baisakhi 
            and Diwali. Here the community used to have general meetings and approve 
            resolutions. The Akal Takht was the oldest of the Five Takhts, but it 
            was destroyed by the Indian Army during its military invasion in 1984. 
            It's reconstruction is almost complete. <br>

          Damdama Sahib is situated in the village of Talwandi Sabo near Bhatinda. 
          This is where Guru Gobind Singh stayed for nearly a year and compiled 
          the final edition of the Guru Granth Sahib known as the Damdama Sahib

          Keshgarh Sahib is situated at Anandpur. It is considered the birthplace 
          of the Khalsa. The Khalsa order was founded here by Guru Gobind Singh 
          in 1699. Some of the weapons of Guru Gobind Singh are displayed here. 
          The most precious of these is the actual Khanda (double edged sword) 
          used by Guru Gobind Singh to prepare the amrit (sweet water) used in 
          the first Khalsa initiation ceremony.<br>

          Hazur Sahib is on the banks of Godavari in Maharashtra. This is where 
          Guru Gobind Singh left this world. The inner room of the temple is called

          Patna Sahib is situated in Patna the capital of Bihar. It was here that 
          Guru Gobind Singh was born in 1666 and spent his early years before 
          moving to Anandpur. Besides being the birthplace of Guru Gobind Singh, 
          Patna was also honoured by visits from Guru Nanak as well as Guru Tegh 
        Bahadur. </font>        </p></div>
