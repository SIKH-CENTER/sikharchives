          <p><img src="images\guru9.jpg" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru 
          Tegh Bahadur was the youngest son of Guru Hargobind and Bibi Nanki and 
          was born at Amritsar on April 1, 1621. From a young age Tegh Bahadur 
          was trained in the martial arts of swordsmanship and horse riding as 
          well as religious training by the wise Baba Buddha and Bhai Gurdas. 
          In February 1633 Tegh Bahadur was married to Gujari daughter of Lal 
          Chand and Bishan Kaur. During his young years Tegh Bahadur fought along 
          his fathers side but after Guru Hargobind's fierce and bloody battle 
          in 1634 at Kartarpur he turned to the path of renunciation and meditation. 
          When Guru Hargobind settled down at Kiratpur to live the rest of his 
          life in peace, Tegh Bahadur spent nine years with his father before 
          settling down at the isolated village of Bakala in 1656 and retired 
          to a life of contemplation. He became known as "Tyag Mal" meaning "the 
          Master of Renunciation". Here Tegh Bahadur would spend many long years 
          in meditation and prayer.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Hargobind 
          did not choose Tegh Bahadur as his successor because the Sikhs needed 
          a leader of men, something still lacking in his young son, who had now 
          chosen a path of renunciation. Instead Guru Hargobind chose Guru Har 
          Rai his grandson as his natural successor. Guru Har Rai in turn chose 
          his youngest son Guru Harkrishan as his successor. When Guru Harkrishan 
          had suddenly fallen ill at Delhi in 1664, before his death, being too 
          weak to move or speak the Guru had said his successor was "Baba Bakala". 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Following the untimely 
          death of Guru Harkrishan large numbers of Sikhs flocked to the village 
          of Bakala looking for the new Guru. When the Sikhs went in large numbers 
          to Bakala to find the Guru, they were instead confronted by twenty two 
          members of the Sodhi family, each claiming that they were the Guru and 
          successor as named by Guru Harkrishan. The Sikhs were in a quandary 
          as to who was really the true Guru?</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Meanwhile a wealthy 
          merchant Makhan Shah had his ships carrying valuable cargo caught in 
          a fierce storm at sea. He vowed to offer five hundred gold coins to 
          the Guru if his goods safely reached home. His wish was fulfilled and 
          his merchandise safely arrived at their port. Makhan Shah immediately 
          set our for Delhi where he received the tragic news that Guru Harkrishan 
          had passed away and that his successor was at Bakala. Makhan Shah set 
          out for Bakala to pay his homage to the Guru. When he finally got there 
          he was confronted with all the same quandary as the rest of the Sikhs, 
          who was the real Guru? Being a businessman Makhan Shah decided that 
          he would pay homage to all of the twenty two claimants and placed two 
          gold coins before each of them as tribute. When he had visited all of 
          the claimants, a child pointed out to him that a holy man lived across 
          the street. Makhan Shah decided that he may as well pay him tribute 
          also. When Makhan Shah entered the house he found that Guru Tegh Bahadur 
          was in meditation. He was told that Tegh Bahadur did not like to receive 
          visitors but spent his time in meditation. Makhan Shah waited until 
          he met the Guru and placed two gold coins before him. At this Guru Tegh 
          Bahadur smiled and said to Makhan Shah, "I thought that you had pledged 
          five hundred coins". Makhan Shah became so elated that he kissed the 
          Gurus feet and started shouting from the rooftop "I've found the Guru, 
          found the Guru!". All the Sikhs rushed to the house of the quiet saint 
          and when they heard the story there was much rejoicing for many days. 
          Thus the pious, humble saint Tegh Bahadur was acclaimed as being the 
          true Guru of the Sikhs and natural successor of Guru Harkrishan.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Sikhs flocked to 
          see the Guru and presented him with many gifts and offerings. One who 
          was not so happy about the whole affair was the troublesome Dhir Mal, 
          grandson of Guru Hargobind who had wanted people to acclaim him as the 
          Guru since he was in possession of the Guru Granth Sahib written by 
          Guru Arjan Dev. Dhir Mal became so angry that he planned an assassination 
          attempt. He sent Shihan a masand (priest) loyal to him and some men 
          to attack the Guru while he slept. Dhir Mal's men attacked the house 
          of Guru Tegh Bahadur, shot the Guru and ransacked his belongings. Luckily 
          Guru Tegh Bahadur was not seriously wounded. In retaliation loyal Sikhs 
          raided Dhir Mal's house, looting it including the original copy of the 
          Guru Granth Sahib and presented all of the bounty to the Guru as revenge. 
          Guru Tegh Bahadur believed in forgiveness and ordered all of his property 
          returned, including the original copy of the Guru Granth Sahib.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Tegh Bahadur 
          now accepted the role of leading the Sikhs and set out on a number of 
          missionary journeys. He visited Kiratpur and then made his way to the 
          other great centers of Sikhism, Tarn Taran, Khadur Sahib, Goindwal and 
          Amritsar. At Amritsar Guru Tegh Bahadur bathed in the sacred pool but 
          he was refused entry into the Golden Temple which was under the control 
          of Harji, grandson of that other famous troublemaker to the Gurus, Prithi 
          Chand. Guru Tegh Bahadur then journeyed back to Kiratpur. Here he encountered 
          some Sodhi family jealousy and decided to found a new township. The 
          Guru acquired a tract of land from the raja of Kahlur and founded the 
          town of Chak Nanaki in 1665, named in honour of his mother (later to 
          be known as Anandpur Sahib). The Guru now continued his journeys to 
          spread the messages and teachings of Sikhism among the masses across 
          the land. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Accompanied by 
          his wife and mother Guru Tegh Bahadur traveled across the country. The 
          Guru traveled throughout Punjab, wherever he would stop the Guru would 
          get wells dug for the people and community kitchens set up. Guru Tegh 
          Bahadur continued his tour through Haryana and arrived at Delhi. Here 
          the Guru met the congregations of Delhi who came out in large numbers 
          to see the Guru. The emperor Aurangzeb was away from Delhi at this time. 
          Guru Tegh Bahadur then continued his mission of preaching to the masses, 
          visiting Kurekshetra, Agra, Ittawa and Allahabad. Wherever the Guru 
          stopped he would preach about honest work and charity. The Guru would 
          also give away all the offerings that he would receive from devotees. 
          At Priyag, the Gurus wife Gujri conceived a child. The Guru then traveled 
          onto the holy Hindu city of Banaras and then onto Gaya and Patna. Guru 
          Tegh Bahadur was requested by custodians of the various temples that 
          he visited to perform rituals and ceremonies for himself and his ancestors, 
          but the Guru refused saying, "He who trusts in God and makes an honest 
          living to share with others and injures no one, nor harbors ill-will 
          against another need perform on other rituals. His soul ever stays in 
          health. And, as for the ancestors, they gather the reward of what they 
          themselves have sown and no one can bless or curse them after they are 
          gone."</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Tegh Bahadur 
          now arrived at Patna where he stayed for some time. The Guru left his 
          family here, as his wife Mata Gujri was expecting their child and moved 
          onwards with his tour to Dacca and the eastern most parts of India not 
          visited since the time of Guru Nanak. Sikh congregations were very jubilant 
          to see their Guru. In December of 1666 while on his eastern tour Guru 
          Tegh Bahadur received the news that he had been blessed with a child, 
          a son named Gobind Rai. This eastern tour would last three years as 
          Guru Tegh Bahadur visited as many people as he could. While in Assam 
          in 1668 Guru Tegh Bahadur was able to achieve a peace treaty between 
          the ruler of Ahom and a large force sent by Aurengzeb under the command 
          of Raja Ram Singh of Amber. In 1669-1670 Guru Tegh Bahadur started the 
          journey homeward and traveled to Patna to see his young son Gobind Rai 
          for the first time. Here Guru Tegh Bahadur spent over a year with his 
          family training his son in the Sikh Scriptures, horse riding and swordsmanship. 
          Guru Tegh Bahadur then sent his family onto Punjab while he continued 
          his missionary work. The Guru finally returned home to Anandpur Sahib 
          in 1672-1673. Here thousands of devotees flock to see and hear the Guru.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> While the Guru 
          attended to his devotees at Anandpur, things in the country were rapidly 
          deteriorating under the tyrannous rule of emperor Aurengzeb. Since coming 
          to power by imprisoning his father and killing his two brothers, Aurengzeb 
          had been consolidating his power base. After ten years he now began 
          to apply his power throughout the country. Aurengzeb was an orthodox 
          Muslim who dreamed of purging India of all 'infidels' and converting 
          it into a land of Islam. Aurengzeb had no tolerance for other religions 
          and proceeded on a brutal campaign of repression. Famous Hindu temples 
          throughout the country were demolished and mosques built in their place. 
          Hindu idols were placed in the steps of mosques to be trodden on by 
          the feet of Muslim pilgrims. Aurangzeb issued a number of harsh decrees. 
          In 1665 he forbade Hindus to display illuminations at Diwali festivals. 
          In 1668 he forbade Hindu Jatras, in 1671 he issued an order that only 
          Muslims could be landlords of crown lands, and called upon provincial 
          Viceroys to dismiss all Hindu clerks. In 1669 he issued a general order 
          calling upon all governors of all provinces to destroy with a willing 
          hand the schools and temples of the infidels; and they were told to 
          put a stop to the teachings and practicing of idolatrous forms of worship. 
          In 1674 lands held by Hindus in Gujarat, in religious grants were all 
          confiscated.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In this climate 
          of intolerance the viceroy of Kashmir Iftikhar Khan took to the task 
          of forcibly converting the Hindu population to Islam by the sword. The 
          Hindu Brahmin Pandits of Kashmir were among the most highly learned 
          and orthodox of the Hindu leadership. Aurangzeb felt if they could be 
          converted, the rest of the country would easily follow. He did not want 
          to see the talik (holy mark on the forehead) or janaeu (sacred thread) 
          on any of his subjects. Given this ultimatum, a large delegation of 
          500 Kashmiri Pandits decided to journey to Anandpur Sahib to seek the 
          help of Guru Tegh Bahadur. This delegation was led by Pandit Kirpa Ram 
          Datt (who would later on become the Sanskrit teacher of Guru Gobind 
          Singh and eventually become a Khalsa and died fighting in the battle 
          of Chamkaur). The Pandits met the Guru and explained their dire predicament 
          to the Guru and requested the Guru to intercede on their behalf. As 
          the Guru was pondering over the issue his nine year old son Gobind Rai 
          walked into the room, noticing the serious and gloomy mood in the room 
          the young Gobind asked his father what was happening. Guru Tegh Bahadur 
          replied, "Unless a holy man lays down his head for the sake of the poor 
          Brahmins, there is no hope for their escape from imperial tyranny." 
          Young Gobind replied, "Revered father, who would be better equipped 
          for this than yourself?" Guru Tegh Bahadur hugged his son and wept for 
          joy. "I was only worried about the future, for you are far too young". 
          "Leave me to God", Gobind replied, "and accept the challenge of the 
          Mughals." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Even though Guru 
          Nanak had refused to wear the sacred thread when he was young, the Gurus 
          still believed in the freedom of religion and the right of the Hindus, 
          Muslims and Sikhs to live in peace and practice their own religions. 
          With this Guru Tegh Bahadur laid down the gauntlet in the fight for 
          freedom of religion and told the Pandits to inform Aurangzeb that the 
          Brahmins would gladly accept and embrace Islam if Guru Tegh Bahadur 
          can be convinced to do so. Guru Tegh Bahadur made preparations to leave 
          for Delhi. he bid farewell to his family and followers and dictated 
          that his son Gobind Rai should be installed as the next Guru. Accompanying 
          the Guru on his journey and also prepared to accept the consequences 
          of whatever happened were Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Dyala and Bhai Sati Das. 
          As soon as Aurangzeb heard the news he ordered the immediate arrest 
          of the Guru. Guru Tegh Bahadur and his party were arrested soon after 
          they left Anandpur Sahib and taken in chains to Delhi.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When brought before 
          Aurangzeb, he was asked why he was hailed as the Guru or prophet and 
          called 'Sacha Padsah' (the True King) and if he really believed in his 
          being one he should perform a miracle to justify his claim. Guru Tegh 
          Bahadur reprimanded the emperor for his blind orthodoxy and his persecution 
          of other faiths, "Hinduism may not be my faith, and I may believe not 
          in the supremacy of Veda or the Brahmins, nor in idol worship or caste 
          or pilgrimages and other rituals, but I would fight for the right of 
          all Hindus to live with honour and practice their faith according to 
          their own rites." The Guru answered further, "Every ruler of the world 
          must pass away, but not the Word of God or His Saint. This is how people 
          not only call me a True King but have done so through the two centuries 
          before me in respect of my House and also in respect of others who preceded 
          them and identified themselves not with the temporal and the contingent, 
          but with the eternal and the ever dying." The Guru refused to perform 
          any miracles saying, "this is the work of charlatans and mountebanks 
          to hoodwink the people. Men of God submit ever to the Will of God." 
          Guru Tegh Bahadur refused to embrace Islam, saying "For me, there is 
          only one religion - of God - and whosoever belongs to it, be he a Hindu 
          or a Muslim, him I own and he owns me. I neither convert others by force, 
          nor submit to force, to change my faith." Aurangzeb was enraged and 
          ordered Guru Tegh Bahadur to be forced to convert to Islam through torture 
          or be killed.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Tegh Bahadur 
          was subjected to many cruelties, he was kept in an iron cage and starved 
          for many days. The Guru was made to watch as Bhai Mati Das the devoted 
          Sikh was tied between two pillars and his body split in two by being 
          sawn alive. Bhai Dyala was boiled alive in a cauldron of boiling water 
          and Bhat Sati Das was wrapped in cotton wool and set on fire. The Guru 
          bore these cruelties without flinching or showing any anger or distress. 
          Finally on November 11, 1675 Guru Tegh Bahadur was publicly beheaded 
          with the sword of the executioner as he prayed. The Gurus body was left 
          in the dust as no one dared to pick up the body for fear of the emperors 
          reprisal. A severe storm swept through the city and under the cover 
          of darkness a Sikh named Bhai Jaita managed to collect the Guru's sacred 
          head and carried it off to Anandpur Sahib to the Guru's son. Another 
          Sikh Bhai Lakhi Shah who had a cart, was able to smuggle the Gurus headless 
          body to his house. Since a public funeral would be too dangerous, Bhai 
          Lakhi Shah cremated the body by setting his house on fire. Meanwhile 
          the head was taken to the grief stricken young Guru Gobind Singh and 
          the widow Mata Gujari. On November 16, 1675 at Anandpur Sahib, a pyre 
          of sandalwood was constructed, sprinkled with roses and the head of 
          Guru Tegh Bahadur was cremated by young Guru Gobind Singh. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Thus ended the 
          earthly reign of the ninth Nanak, Guru Tegh Bahadur. Never in the annals 
          of history has the religious leader of one religion sacrificed his life 
          to save the freedom of another religion. </font>
