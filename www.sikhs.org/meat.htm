        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The view of Sikhism 
          is that eating meat or abstaining from it is the individuals choice. 
          A Sikh is considered no lesser or greater a Sikh if they eat meat or 
          are a vegetarian.</font>

          15th 1980 that Amritdhari Sikhs can eat meat as long as it is jhatka 
          meat and that eating meat does not go against the code of conduct, Kurehit, 
          of the Sikhs. Thus a Sikh cannot be excommunicated for eating meat.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jhatka meat is 
          meat in which the animal has been killed quickly without suffering or 
          religious ritual. </font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sikhism, A Complete 
          Introduction, Dr. H.S.Singha &amp; Satwant Kaur, Hemkunt Press</b><br>
          We must give the rationale behind prescribing jhatka meat as the approved 
          food for the Sikhs. According to the ancient Aryan Hindu tradition, 
          only such meat as is obtained from an animal which is killed with one 
          stroke of the weapon causing instantaneous death is fit for human consumption. 
          However, with the coming of Islam into India and the Muslim political 
          hegemony, it became a state policy not to permit slaughter of animals 
          for food, in any other manner, except as laid down in the Quran - the 
          kosher meat prepared by slowly severing the main blood artery of the 
          throat of the animal while reciting verses from the Quran. It is done 
          to make slaughter a sacrifice to God and to expiate the sins of the 
          slaughter. Guru Gobind Singh took a rather serious view of this aspect 
          of the whole matter. He, therefore, while permitting flesh to be taken 
          as food repudiated the whole theory of this expiatory sacrifice and 
          the right of ruling Muslims to impose iton the non-Muslims. Accordingly, 
          he made jhatka meat obligatory for those Sikhs who may be interested 
          in taking meat as a part of their food.</font> </p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sikhs and Sikhism, 
          Dr. I.J.Singh, Manohar Publishers.</b><br>
          And one semitic practice clearly rejected in the Sikh code of conduct 
          is eating flesh of an animal cooked in ritualistic manner; this would 
          mean kosher and halal meat. The reason again does not lie in religious 
          tenet but in the view that killing an animal with a prayer is not going 
          to enoble the flesh. No ritual, whoever conducts it, is going to do 
          any good either to the animal or to the diner. Let man do what he must 
          to assuage his hunger. If what he gets, he puts to good use and shares 
          with the needy, then it is well used and well spent, otherwise not.</font> </p>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Why is Meat not 
        served in Langar?</b></font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The reason why 
          meat is not served at langar in the Gurdwaras is because langar is supposed 
          to be a symbol of equality of mankind where all people no matter what 
          race, religion or caste can eat toghether in the atmosphere of brotherhood. 
          Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, it does not matter who they are. Different religions 
          have different dietary restrictions. Hindus cannot eat cow, muslims 
          cannot eat pork and will only eat halal meat. Jews will only eat kosher 
          meat, others cannot eat fish or eggs. But in a gurdwara langar, it does 
          not matter what their dietary taboos or religious beliefs are, the food 
          is designed so that all can eat together and no one will be offended 
          or not be able to partake of the meal.</font> </p>
