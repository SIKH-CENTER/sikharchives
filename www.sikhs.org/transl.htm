        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Japji hymn by Guru Nanak is considered 
          to be the key to Sri Guru Granth Sahib and an epitome of the Sikh doctrine. 
          It appears as the first poem in Sri Guru Granth Sahib and is repeated 
          by Sikhs in their morning prayers, as well as when preparing Amrit for 
          the Khalsa baptism ceremony. Japji lays stress on the brotherhood of 
          man and remembrance of God as the key to salvation. The Japji Sahib 
          appears in it's original Gurmukhi with romanized pronunciation guide 
          and english translation.</font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A concise history of the Sikhs, Ardas is 
          used as the common prayer. It is recited whenever starting or ending 
          any reading of Sri Guru Granth Sahib or any other important task. The 
          first part of it appears as a prologue to Chandi Di Var written by Guru 
          Gobind Singh invoking blessings of God and the Gurus. The remainder 
          of the bulk was incorporated by the great Sikh scholar Bhai Mani Singh. 
          Further additions have been added over time taking into account major 
          events affecting Sikhs.</font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
          Part of the daily prayers prescribed for Sikhs, the poem Tav-Prasad Savaiye by Guru Gobind Singh is usually read after 
          Japji and Jap in the mornings. In it Guru Gobind Singh expounds the 
          uselessness of rituals and blind faith without sincere worship of God. 
          It is found in the Dasam Granth, the collection of the writings of Guru 
          Gobind Singh.</font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
          During the Sikh marriage ceremony called Anand Karaj, the Lawan is read from Sri Guru Granth Sahib. There are four main 
          stanzas to this poem written by Guru Ram Das. In unison with the reading 
          of each of the four stanzas, the bride and groom complete a circle around 
          the Guru Granth Sahib.</font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Known as the Letter of Victory, Zafarnama 
          was written in Persian by Guru Gobind Singh as a letter of defiance 
          and delivered to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707. It was composed 
          by Guru Gobind Singh in one of the darkest times for the Sikhs. Guru 
          Gobind Singh had lost his four sons, while most of the Sikhs had either 
          been scattered or killed on the battlefield.. The letter praises God 
          and then outlines the bloody battle of Chamkaur and the treachery of 
          Aurangzeb and the Mughals who broke their oath not to attack the Sikhs. 
          Zafarnama is important to Sikhs because it contains the doctrine of 
          the use of force being justifiable if all other peaceful means have 
          failed.</font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bedtime prayer, Kirtan Sohila is usually 
          recited just before sleeping at night. It's name means 'Song of Peace'. 
          Kirtan Sohila is composed of five hymns, the first three by Guru Nanak 
          Dev, the fourth by Guru Ram Das and the fifth by Guru Arjan Dev. This 
          hymn is usually recited at the conclusion of evening ceremonies at the 
          Gurdwara and also recited as part of Sikh funeral services.</font>

          Amar Das is the 'Song of Eternal Bliss and Joy'. It is composed of 40 
          stanzas and is also recited by the five beloved ones during the Khalsa 
          initiation ceremony.</font>

          Immortal) Kabitas (71 to 90) by Guru Gobind 
          Singh denounces blind rituals. The Akal Ustati is a lengthy poem composed

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
          Part of The Vachitra Natak meaning 'The Wonderous Drama' by Guru Gobind 
          Singh, Chapter V narrates the succession 
          of the first nine Gurus preceding Guru Gobind Singh. It emphasizes that 
          all the Gurus were the same spirit and praises the great martyrdom of 
          Guru Tegh Bahadur who died to preserve the concept of freedom of religion. 
          The Vachitra Natak is a very detailed account of the life of Guru Gobind 
          Singh written by Himself, it appears in the Dasam Granth and is the 
          only existing autobiography of any Guru.</font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second last poetical composition in Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Gun 
          Gobind gaio nahin janamu akarth kin is a poem of 57 couplets written 
          by Guru Tegh Bahadur. In it Guru Tegh Bahadur criticizes those who are 
          attached to the illusion of the material world (maya, mammon) and have 
          forgotten God, the Guru urges man to remember God at all times.</font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike traditional poetical compositions of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Sidhha 
          Goshth is a record of the conversation between Guru Nanak and 
          the Sidhhas, a group of Nanth Yogis which the Guru met on his travels 
          to the Himalayan mountains. 'Goshth' means discussion, Sidhha Goshth 
          is the detailed transcript of the questions posed to Guru Nanak by the 
          Yogis and the Gurus answers. It is a great philosophical discussion 
          in which the Guru answers the Yogis questions about the meaning of life, 
          God and creation. </font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fight against social and political injustice has historically been 
          an integral part of Sikhism. As a religious leader Guru Nanak did not 
          turn a blind eye to political supression or consider it outside the 
          realm of religion, but undertook political protest 
          through his writings, speaking out against the cruelty of rulers. Guru 
          Nanak wrote a number of passages about the Mughal invasion of India 
          by Babur and the brutalities that he eyewitnessed first hand (Babur 
          Bani). Guru Nanak also spoke out about the suffering of people at the 
          hands of unscrupulous rulers and government officials </font>
