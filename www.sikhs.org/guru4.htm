          <p><img src="images\guru4.jpg" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guru 
          Ram Das was born on September 24, 1534 to simple God-fearing parents, 
          Hari Das and Anup Devi of Lahore. Known as Jetha meaning the first born, 
          he was a handsome young man. When he grew up he could always be found 
          in the company of religious men. One day Jetha came across a party of 
          Sikhs who were on their way to Goindwal to pay homage to Guru Amar Das. 
          Jetha decided to join them and also travel to Goindwal. Upon their arrival 
          and meeting, Guru Amar Das at once noticed the young Jetha with his 
          pleasant manner and sense of devotion. While his fellow travelers returned 
          to Lahore, Jetha decided to stay and become a disciple of Guru Amar 
          Das. His hard work, and devotion eventually won him the hand of Guru 
          Amar Das's younger daughter, Bibi Bhani. They went on to have three 
          sons, Prithi Chand, Mahadev and Arjan Dev.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jetha became a 
              trusted disciple of Guru Amar Das. As described previously he successfully 
              represented Guru Ram Das before the Mughal royal court to defend the 
              charges by jealous Hindus that Sikhism maligned both the Hindu and Muslim 
              religions. "Birth and caste are of no avail before God. It is deeds 
              which make or unmake a man. To exploit ignorant people with superstitions 
              and to call it religion is a sacrilege against God and man. To worship 
              the infinite, formless and absolute God in the form of a totem, an image 
              or an insignificant or time-bound object of nature, or to wash one's 
              sins not through compassion and self-surrender, but through ablutions; 
              to insist upon special diets, languages and dresses, and fads about 
              what to eat and what not, and to condemn the mass of human beings, including 
              women, to the status of sub-humans and to deny them the reading of the 
              scriptures and even work of every kind is to tear apart man from man. 
              This is not religion, not is it religion to deny the world through which 
              alone man can find his spiritual possibilities." The Emperor Akbar was 
              greatly impressed by the tenants of Sikhism as explained by Jetha and 
              dismissed all of the charges.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Eventually Jetha 
                was ordained as Guru Amar Das's successor and named Guru Ram Das (meaning 
                servant of God). These events have previously been described.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When the aged ascetic 
                  son of Guru Nanak Baba Sri Chand came to visit Guru Ram Das he asked 
                  him why he kept such a long beard? Guru Ram Das replied; "To wipe the 
                  dust off the feet of holy men like yourself" and then proceeded to perform 
                  this supreme act of humility. Sri Chand held his hand and embraced Guru 
                  Ram Das saying; "It's enough. This is the kind of character by which 
                  you have deprived me of my ancestral heritage. Now, what more is left 
                  with me that I could offer you for your piety and goodness of heart?"</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Ram Das now 
                    eagerly continued the building of the city of Ramdaspur (the abode of 
                    Ram Das) by digging of the second sacred pool as he had been instructed 
                    by Guru Amar Das. Pilgrims came in large numbers to hear the Guru and 
                    to help in the excavation work of the tank. The holy tank would be called 
                    Amritsar meaning pool of nectar. Today the city which is the holiest 
                    center of Sikhism has come to be know as Amritsar. Guru Ram Das urged 
                    his Sikhs that one could fulfill one's life not merely by quiet meditation 
                    but in actively participating in the joys and sorrows of others. This 
                    is how one could also rid oneself of the prime malady - Ego, and end 
                    their spiritual loneliness.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One of the new 
                      entries into the Sikh fold at this time was Bhai Gurdas Bhalla, the 
                      son of the younger brother of Guru Amar Das. Bhai Gurdas was a superb 
                      poet and scholar of comparative religion who would later go on become 
                      the scribe of the first edition of the Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Amar 
                      Das was impressed with Bhai Gurdas's existing knowledge of Hindi and 
                      Sanskrit and the Hindu scriptures. Following the tradition of sending 
                      out Masands across the country Guru Amar Das deputed Bhai Gurdas to 
                      Agra to spread the gospel of Sikhism. Before leaving Guru Amar Das prescribed 
                      the following routine for Sikhs;</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"He who calls himself 
                        a Sikh of the True Guru, He must get up in the morning and say his prayers. 
                        He must rise in the early hours and bathe in the holy tank. He must 
                        meditate on God as advised by the Guru. And rid himself of the afflictions 
                        of sins and evil. As the day dawns, he should recite scriptures, and 
                        repeat God's name in every activity. He to whom the Guru takes kindly 
                        is shown the path. Nanak! I seek the dust of the feet of the Guru's 
                        Sikh who himself remembers God and makes others remember Him." (Gauri)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The standard Sikh 
                          marriage ceremony known as the Anand Karaj is centered around the Lawan, 
                          a four stanza hymn composed by Guru Ram Das. The marriage couple circumscribe 
                          the Guru Granth Sahib as each stanza is read. The first round is the 
                          Divine consent for commencing the householders life through marriage. 
                          The second round states that the union of the couple has been brought 
                          about by God. In the third round the couple is described as the most 
                          fortunate as they have sung the praises of the Lord in the company of 
                          saints. In the fourth round the feeling of the couple that they have 
                          obtained their hearts desire and are being congratulated is described. 
                          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Ram Das's 
                            first cousin Sahari Mal came to invite the Guru to visit Lahore in connection 
                            with the marriage of his son. The Guru being much too busy with his 
                            work promised to send one of his sons instead. Guru Ram Das asked his 
                            eldest son Prithi Chand to attend on his behalf, but he refused. Prithi 
                            Chand feared that his father was perhaps trying to eliminate him in 
                            order to install his youngest brother Arjan as the next Guru. Arjan 
                            was a great favorite of his father. Mahadev the Guru's middle son was 
                            a recluse and excused himself on the ground that he was not interested 
                            in the affairs of the world. The Guru therefore asked his youngest son 
                            Arjan to attend, which he agreed to do with such grace and humility, 
                            that Guru Ram Das was very pleased. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Arjan now proceeded 
                              to Lahore, where his father asked him to remain until called for and 
                              to take charge of the needs and education of the Sikhs in Lahore, his 
                              ancestral home. After two years of feeling intensely homesick, Arjan 
                              composed a poem of love and devotion and sent it to Guru Ram Das. 
                              This poem along with another one a few month's later were intercepted 
                              by the Guru's jealous son Prithi Chand who made sure his father never 
                              received them. Finally Arjan wrote a third poem and numbered it with 
                              a 3 and gave strict instructions to the messenger to only hand it over 
                              to the Guru personally.</font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A moment's separation 
                                and it was like an age. When do I see you now, my beloved Lord? My night 
                                does not pass, nor do I get sleep, Without seeing the Guru's darbar. 
                                I am a sacrifice, I am a sacrifice again to the true darbar of the Guru. 
                                3" (Majh) </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Upon finally receiving 
                                  this poem, Guru Ram Das sensed what must have happened to the earlier 
                                  two messages so he confronted his eldest son Prithi Chand. At first, 
                                  Prithi Chand denied everything, but seeing the insistence of the Guru 
                                  and the consequences of refusal to obey him, he finally confessed his 
                                  treachery and produced the other two letters. When Guru Ram Das read 
                                  them, he was moved to tears by the humility and sincerity of his son 
                                  Arjan's compositions. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Guru Ram Das immediately 
                                    sent for Baba Buddha to journey to Lahore and to bring back his son 
                                    Arjan with full honour. The Guru then had Bhai Budhha apply the 
                                    saffron mark to the forehead of Arjan and declared him his successor. 
                                    Prithi Chand would not accept his fathers wishes and continued to misbehave 
                                    and abuse Guru Arjan Dev. Guru Ram Das had to publicly condemn his son 
                                    Prithi Chand for his actions. Shortly thereafter Guru Ram Das breathed 
                                    his last on September 1 1581. </font>
