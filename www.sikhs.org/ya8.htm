          <h3>Khalsa</h3>
   
        
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Tenth Master 
          writes: When I had become one with God, He said to this worm, &quot;Now, 
          you will be called my son. I created you to show My Panth to the world. 
          Go, spread Dharma, and show people how to refrain from foolish practices.&quot; 
          (DG, p.57) and, &quot;My venerable Guru (My father, The Ninth Master), 
          gave his life for the sake of Dharma. 'You have to spread Dharma everywhere, 
          defeat and capture the corrupt and the tyrant.' This is why I have come 
          to this world. All True Seekers should understand this clearly, I took 
          a human birth only for this purpose: To promote Dharma, to nurture genuine 
          Sainthood, and to destroy the roots of all corruption.&quot; (DG, p.57) 
          </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Khalsa is the highest, 
          and the most glorified state, of a Sikh, who has attained spiritual 
          perfection. The term 'Khalsa Panth' is used to indicate a fellowship 
          of Sikhs who are adherent to the principles taught by the Ten Sikh Masters. 
          Some baptized Sikhs have now started to use this word as their last 
          name.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The term Khalsa 
          (God's Own) is reserved for those Gursikhs who have perfected the spiritual 
          principles of The Tenth Master. Khalsa is a spiritual clone of Guru 
          Gobind Singh Ji, who is the father of Khalsa. Therefore, only a Gursikh, 
          after accepting the Amrit, can hope to realize this ideal. However, 
          taking Amrit is not an automatic conversion into a Khalsa. Amrit is 
          just a beginning on this Path. It is wrong to assume that a baptized 
          Sikh is a Khalsa. The word, Khalsa, is used more as an adjective rather 
          than a noun. Khalsa is a rare soul.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How rare is Khalsa? 
          Most Sikhs of today have probably never met one. Most of those who meet 
          a True Gursikh do not recognize him. To be able to recognize him, you 
          need to have an intense desire to meet such a person. He does not advertise 
          himself! As Kabir Ji said, &quot;Kabir, having found the Divine gems, 
          do not display your goods. Neither is there a market, nor recognition, 
          nor a customer willing to pay the price for your priceless merchandise.&quot; 
          (SGGS, p.1365)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikhs may respectfully 
          call each other Khalsa. However, calling ourselves Khalsa does not make 
          us Khalsa. For a Khalsa Gursikh, in his humility, this word represents 
          an ideal that he will continue to revere all his life. He sees Khalsa 
          in the Sangat, or another Gursikh, and ignores his own greatness. This 
          is why the Sangat is often called Khalsa Ji, or Guru Khalsa Ji. Though 
          the term &quot;Guru Panth Khalsa&quot; is popular, it stands for only 
          such Gursikhs in the Sangat. A Gursikh, or a Khalsa Gursikh, would not 
          consider himself worthy of such an honor. He would not accept to be 
          called a saint, a sadhu nor a guru, either.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Others can do whatever 
          they desire, but a Khalsa (A Sikh Saint) strictly follows the rules 
          of the Tenth Master, and does not go around offering personal initiation 
          to seekers. However, he does not hide away from the Sangat. Being humble, 
          he is always nurtured by the spiritual sharing with the so-called common 
          people. As The Tenth Master said: &quot;I am glorified and sit on a 
          throne only because of the mercy of these Sikhs, or I would be lying 
          on the streets, just like the millions worthless like me.&quot; (DG, 
          p.645)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saint Scholar Shri 
          Naranjan Singh Ji would not let anyone bow to him, or call him a saint. 
          Hindus and Sikhs, whoever met him, became firm followers of Guru Granth 
          Sahib. The mere sight of him at the feet of Guru Granth Sahib convinced 
          others that this Holy Scripture is a Living Guru. This is the conduct 
          (Jugat) of a Perfect Sikh Saint. He appealed that all Sikhs should say, 
          &quot;<b>Dhann Shri Guru Granth Sahib</b>&quot; (Guru Granth Sahib is 
          Glorious), five times every morning when they first open their eyes. 
          He said that if you did this every day for forty days, you could see 
          that Guru's Light (Jote) lives in Guru Granth Sahib. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The word &quot;Khalsa&quot; 
          has several meanings. The most common is &quot;Pure.&quot; Shri Naranjan 
          Singh Ji described one meaning of Khalsa as &quot;Property.&quot; Here 
          is the definition of Khalsa in the words of The Tenth Master:</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Day and night, 
          he worships the Living Light. He does not entertain any thought of duality. 
          Perfect Love and perfect conviction adorn his personality. How can he 
          follow fasting (rituals) or, even by accident, pray to an idol or a 
          grave? His pilgrimage will be Daan (giving), mercy, self-discipline 
          of tolerance, and self-control. He sees only the One, One God everywhere. 
          Only when The Perfect Light fully illuminates his heart, can you call 
          him Khalsa. Otherwise, he is not Khalsa.&quot; (DG, p.712) and:</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;One who knows 
          the delight of abiding in the Overself alone, is Khalsa, worthy of adoration. 
          There is not a miniscule difference between him, me, and my beloved 
          God.&quot; (SLG, p.668)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us not dishonor 
          this word by using it in a trivial manner. The Tenth Master has attributed 
          the highest virtues to Khalsa: &quot;Khalsa is my Dharma and my aim. 
          Khalsa is my innermost secret. Khalsa is my Perfect True Guru. Khalsa 
          is my brave and true friend. Khalsa is my intellect and my knowledge. 
          Khalsa's form is what I meditate on now. I cannot say enough in praise 
          of Khalsa…………..If I had as many tongues as the hair on my body, still 
          I may not be able to finish counting all the virtues of Khalsa. I belong 
          to Khalsa, and Khalsa belongs to me, just like the sea and the drop 
          of sea. Khalsa is the army of God. Khalsa has emerged now only because 
          of His own wish.&quot; (SLG, p.667)</font>
