          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the womb dwelling, 
          the mortal has no lineage and caste. From the seed of the Lord, all 
          have sprung. Say O Pundit, since when hast thou been a Brahmin? Waste 
          not thy life by repeatedly calling thyself Brahmin. If thou art a Brahmin 
          born of a Brahmni Mother, then why has thou not come by some other way? 
          How art thou a Brahmin and how am I of low caste? How am I of blood 
          and how thou art of milk? Says Kabir, only he who contemplates over 
          the Lord, is said to be a Brahmin among us.&quot; <i>(Bhagat Kabir, Gauri, 
          pg. 324)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Brahma was born 
            of the lotus of Vishnu's navel and attuning their throat, people read 
            the Vedas with their mouth. Lord's limit, he could not see and he remained 
            in the darkness of coming and going.&quot; <i>(Guru Nanak, Gujri, pg. 489)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Hindus have 
            forgotten the Primal Lord and are going the wrong way. As Narad instructed 
            so they worship the idols. They are blind, dumb and the blindest of 
            the blind. The ignorant fools take stones and worship them. Those stones 
            when they themselves sink, how shall they ferry thee across?&quot; <i>(Guru 
              Nanak, Slok, pg. 556)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Through Brahma, 
            the hymns of the Vedas were revealed, however he extended the love of 
            worldly pleasures. The seer Shiva remains absorbed in himself and he 
            is engrossed in excessive wrath and pride. Vishnu is ever busy in reincarnating 
            himself. So, by whose association is the world to be emancipated? The 
            Guru-wards are imbued with divine knowledge in this age and they are 
            rid of the darkness of worldly love.&quot; <i>(Guru Amar Das, Wadhans, pg. 
              559)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Reading and reciting 
            the Vedas Brahma grew weary. He found not even a sesame's worth of God. 
            The strivers and adepts roam about wailing. They too are bewitched by 
            mammon. There have been ten incarnations, kings and forsakers like Shiva. 
            They too found not Thine limit, thou some grew weary of smearing their 
            body with ashes.&quot; <i>(Guru Arjan Dev, Suhi, pg. 747)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Vedas know 
            not God's greatness. Brahmas can realize not His secrets. The incarnations 
            know not His limit. Infinite is God, the Transcendent Lord. His state, 
            He Himself knows. Others speak of Him from mere hearsay. Shiva knows 
            not the Lord's way. The gods have grown weary searching for Him. The 
            goddesses know not His mystery. Over all is the Unseen Supreme Lord.&quot; <i>(Guru Arjan, Ramkali, pg. 894)</i></font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>(Guru Gobind 
            Singh, 33 Swaiyyas)</i><br>
            Some cherish, faithfully the images of Vishnu; others call Shiva their 
            God.<br>
            Some proclaim His Presence in the temple, others in the mosque.<br>
            Some declare Rama to be His incarnation, others that He is no other 
            than Krishna.<br>
            I have forsaken these fruitless ways, and the Creator-Lord alone I have 
            called my God.<br>
            The All-pervading God, Unconquerable and Unconceived, how could He as 
            Rama be born from the womb of Kaushalya? If one calls Krishna the Immortal 
            God, then why did he surrender himself to the power of Death?<br>
            All loving is He and All Holy too then why did He drive Arjuna to battle?<br>
            Yea, recognize Him alone to be thy All-powerful God, whose Mystery no 
            one has unraveled, nor will.<br>
            If Krishna be God, the Treasure of Mercy, why the huntsman pierced him 
            with an arrow?<br>
            He who saves the families of others, why did he get his own annihilated?<br>
            He who's called the Primeval God, unconceived, how did He enter into 
            the womb of Devaki?<br>
            Yea, He who has neither father nor mother, how could He call Vasudeva 
            His sire?<br>
            Why call Shiva thy God, why Brahma thy Lord?<br>
            He (God) belongs not to the Raghu clan (of Rama), nor to the family 
            of yadvas (like Krishna), nor is He Rama's spouse; not one of these 
            is the God of the universe.<br>
            You forsake the One and cling to many; but thiswise even Sukhdeva, Prasara 
            and Vyasa (famous Hindu sages) fell in error.<br>
            Hark O man, these ways avail not:<br>
            So, I have recognized the One alone in every form.<br>
            Some look upon Shiva, others on Brahma, as God.<br>
            Still others declare Vishnu as the Lord of the universe dwelling upon 
            whom end ones sins and sorrows.<br>
            Give this thy deepest thought, O ignorant wretch, that all these forsake 
            thee in the end.<br>
            Contemplate Him (God) therefore, who was, and is, and will also be, 
            and whose proof is in thy very heart.<br>
            Millions of Indras and Upindras He made and then brought them to an 
            end.<br>
            And the gods and the demons too and birds and beasts and mountains and 
            Seshnagas.<br>
            For His sake have Brahma and Shiva done penance to this day, but found 
            not His limits.<br>
            Yea, He whose Mystery is fathomed not by the Vedas or the Semitic texts, 
            Him alone my Teacher instructed me to accept as the Guru. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"> </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"> </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font> </p>
