          lasting 5 hours. Using machine guns and mortars the army fires at militant 
          positions atop the two 18th century towers called Ramgarhia Bunga's, 
          and the water tank behind Teja Singh Samundri Hall as well as surrounding 
          buildings. At least 100 are killed on both sides. </font>

          At 7:00 p.m. Operation Blue Star, the invasion of The Golden Temple 
          begins with tanks of the 16th Cavalry Regiment of the Indian Army moving 
          to enclose the Golden Temple complex. Troops are briefed not to use 
          their guns against the Golden Temple itself or the Akal Takht. Artillery 
          is used to blast off the tops of the Ramgarhia Bungas and the water 
          tank. Scores of buildings in and around the temple complex are blazing. 
          One artillery shell lands more than 5 km away in the crowded city. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the narrow alley 
          behind the Akal Takht paramilitary commandos try to get into the temple. 
          Some make it to the roof but are turned back due to the heavy gunfire. 
          Meanwhile tanks move into the square in front of the northern entrance 
          to the Golden Temple known as the clock tower entrance. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At 10:30 pm commandos 
          from the 1st Battalion, the Parachute Regiment try to run down the steps 
          under the clock tower onto the marble parkarma around the sacred pool. 
          They face heavy gunfire, suffering casualties and are forced to retreat. 
          A second wave of commandos manage to neutralize the machine gun posts 
          on either side of the steps and get down to the parkarma. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Akal Takht 
          is heavily fortified with sandbags and brick gun emplacements in its 
          windows and arches. From here and the surrounding buildings the militants 
          are able to fire at any commandos who make their way in front of the 
          Gurdwara. </font>

          the 7th Garhwal Rifles enter the temple complex from the opposite side 
          on the southern gate entrance and after a gun battle are able to establish 
          a position on the roof of the Temple library. They are reinforced by 
          two companies of the 15th Kumaons. Repeated unsuccessful attempts are 
          made to storm the Akal Takht. </font>

          After midnight tanks are used to break down the steps leading to the 
          parkarma from the hostel side and an 8-wheeled Polish-built armored 
          personnel carrier makes it's way towards the Akal Takht. It is destroyed 
          by a Chinese-made rocket propelled grenade launcher. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Six or more Vijayanta 
          tanks enter the temple complex crushing the delicate marble inlays of 
          the parkarma and plow their way towards the Akal Takht. Orders arrive 
          and the tanks start firing their large 105mm cannons equipped with high 
          explosive squash-head shells into the Akal Takht. These shells are designed 
          for hard targets like armour and fortifications. When the shells his 
          a target, their heads spread or squash on the hard surface. Their fuses 
          are arranged to allow a short delay between the impact and the shells 
          igniting, so that a shock-wave passes through the target and a heavy 
          slab of armour or masonry is forced away from the inside of the target 
          armour or fortification. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The effect on the 
          Akal Takht, the most sacred of the five Takhts, is devastating. Over 
          80 shells are pumped into the sacred Gurdwara. The entire front of the 
          Takht is destroyed and fires break out in many of the different rooms 
          blackening the marble walls and wrecking the delicate decorations dating 
          back to the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Marble inlays, plaster and 
          mirror work, filigree partitions and priceless old wall paintings are 
          all destroyed. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The gold dome of 
          the Akal Takht is also badly damaged by artillery fire. At one stage 
          a 3.7 inch Howell gun is mounted on the roof of a building behind the 
          shrine and fired a number of times at the beautiful dome. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the other end 
          of the Temple complex on the easternmost side a battalion of the Kumaon 
          Regiment were invading the hostel complex where many of the innocent 
          pilgrims were in hiding as well as the temple administration staff. 
          There was no water because the water tower had been destroyed and it 
          was very hot. </font>

          Secretary of S.G.P.C.)<br>
          "They cut our electricity and water supplies. It was very hot in the 
          rooms. There was no water. We had only two plastic buckets of water. 
          Longowal had to place two people as guards over the buckets. Many people 
          would squeeze their undershirts to drink their sweat to quench their 
          thirst."</i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Around 1:00 am 
          the Army entered the hostel and administrative buildings and ordered 
          everyone out and made them sit in the courtyard of the Guru Ram Das 
          Hostel. There were about 250 people who came out. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>(Bhan Singh)<br>
          "Suddenly there was a big explosion. All hell broke loose. It was pitch 
          dark. People started running back into the verandah and the rooms. I 
          and Abhinashi Singh were sitting next to Gurcharan Singh, the former 
          Secretary of the Akali Dal whom Bhindranwale accused of murdering Sodhi. 
          Gurcharan was shot as he tried to run inside. We realized that soldiers 
          were shooting at us. They thought someone from among the crowd had exploded 
          the grenade. But it was probably thrown by extremists on the water tank 
          overlooking the Guru Ram Das Serai (Hostel). We ran to Tohra's room 
          and told Longowal what was happening. Longowal came out and shouted 
          at the Major. He said, 'Don't shoot these people. They are not extremists. 
          They are employees of the S.G.P.C.' The Major then ordered his men to 
          stop shooting. Later in the morning we counted at least seventy dead 
          bodies in the compound. There were women and children too."</i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Among the dead 
          were 35 women and 5 children. The survivors were made to sit in the 
          courtyard of the Guru Ram Das Hostel until curfew was lifted the next 
          evening. They were not given any food, water or medical aid. People 
          drank whatever water was in puddles in the courtyard from the blown 
          up water tank. </font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many of the young 
          men in the group of innocent unarmed civilians were then shot by the

          "I saw about 35 or 36 Sikhs lined up with their hands raised above their 
          heads. And the major was about to order them to be shot. When I asked 
          him for medical help, he got into a rage, tore my turban off my head, 
          and ordered his men to shoot me. I turned back and fled, jumping over 
          the bodies of the dead and injured, and saving my life crawling along 
          the walls. I got to the room where Tohra and Sant Longowal were sitting 
          and told them what I had seen. Sardar Karnail Singh Nag, who had followed 
          me, also narrated what he had seen, as well as the killing of 35 to 
          36 young Sikhs by cannon fire. All of these young men were villagers."</i>

          "Early on the sixth morning the army came into the Guru Ram Das Serai 
          and ordered all of those in the rooms to come out. We were taken into 
          the courtyard. The men were separated from the women. We were also divided 
          into old and young women and I was separated from the children, but 
          I managed to get back to the old women. When we were sitting there the 
          army released 150 people from the basement. They were asked why they 
          had not come out earlier. They said the door had been locked from the 
          outside. They were asked to hold up their hands and then they were shot 
          after 15 minutes. Other young men were told to untie their turbans. 
          They were used to tie their hands behind their backs. The army hit them 
          on the head with the butts of their rifles."</i> </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>(Sujjan Singh 
          Margindpuri)<br>
          "The young men and some other pilgrims were staying in Room Number 61. 
          The army searched all the rooms of the Serai. Nothing objectionable 
          was found from their room. Nor did the army find anything objectionable 
          on their persons. The army locked up 60 pilgrims in that room and shut 
          not only the door but the window also. Electric supply was disconnected. 
          The night between June 5th and June 6th was extremely hot. The locked-in 
          young men felt very thirsty after some time, and loudly knocked on the 
          door from inside to ask the army men on duty for water. They got abuses 
          in return, but no water. The door was not opened. Feeling suffocated 
          and extremely thirsty, the men inside began to faint and otherwise suffer 
          untold misery. The door of the room was opened at 8 am on June 6th. 
          By this time 55 out of the 60 had died. The remaining 5 were also semi-dead."</i>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> By morning light, 
          there is only sporadic sniper fire from the rubble of the Akal Takht. 
          By late afternoon the army was firmly in control of the Temple complex 
          and curfew was lifted for two hours to allow people who were still in 
          hiding to come out. </font>

          <i>"I went to the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) on 5th June around 
          7:30 in the evening because I had to ensure that religious ceremonies 
          were performed. The moment I stepped on to the parkarma I stumbled across 
          a body. Bullets were flying and I had to take shelter behind each and 
          every pillar to reach the Darshani Deorhi. Another body was lying there. 
          I ran a few yards and reached the Akal Takht. Night prayers start at 
          Harmandir Sahib five minutes after they start at the Akal Takht. I wanted 
          to find out if the path (recitation) had started there. I had a glimpse 
          of Bhindranwale. We did not speak to each other. Around 7:45 I came 
          out of the Akal Takht and ran into the Darshani Deorhi. I ran towards 
          Harmandir Sahib, unmindful of the bullets flying past my ears. I began 
          night prayers. Soon a colleague of mine, Giani Mohan Singh, joined me. 
          Seeing the intensity of the fire we decided to close all the doors, 
          barring the front door. Soon we completed all religious rites. We then 
          took the Guru Granth Sahib to the top room to prevent any damage to 
          the holy book. The Head Priest, Giani Sahib Singh, had given clear instructions 
          that under no circumstances was the Guru Granth Sahib to be taken to 
          the Akal Takht if the conditions were not right. </i></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Looking through 
          the window-pane from the first floor of the Harmandir Sahib, I saw a 
          tank standing on the parkarma with its lights on. I thought for a moment 
          that it was the fire brigade come to collect water from the srowar (holy 
          pool) to put out the fire which was raging in almost every room. A few 
          minutes later my belief was shattered when I saw the vehicle emitting 
          fire instead of putting it out. By 10:30 or so around 13 tanks had collected 
          on the parkarma. They had come after crushing the staircase from the 
          eastern wing where Guru Ram Das Serai, the Langer and the Teja Singh 
          Samundari Hall are situated. One after another the cannon fire lit the 
          sky. When the first shell hit the bottom of the Darshani Deorhi, creating 
          a hole in it, I saw the room with the historic chandni (canopy) presented 
          by Maharaja Ranjit Singh catching fire. One after another the big bombs 
          hit the Darshani Deorhi in quick succession, and what was once a lovely 
          building was now on fire. The Toshakhana (Treasury) was also on fire. 
          Occasionally a bullet would hit the Harmandir Sahib. We were 27 people 
          inside, mostly ragis (singers) and sevadars (temple servants).</i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> In the early 
          hours of the morning of 6th June we took the holy book down and performed 
          the religious rites that are performed every day, like maharaj da prakash 
          karna (unfolding the holy book) and reciting hymns from the scriptures. 
          The two side-doors were closed and the front and back doors were open. 
          Bullets kept hitting the wall both inside and outside, ripping off the 
          gold surface at various places. Soon after we finished reciting prayers 
          one of our colleagues, Ragi Avtar Singh was hit. We pulled him into 
          a corner. Another bullet came and hit the holy Granth Sahib. We have 
          preserved this book.</i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> In the meanwhile 
          the pounding of the Akal Takht was continuing. There was no let-up in 
          the fire in other places either. We were thirsty and desperate for water. 
          We crawled to the holy pool to get water for ourselves and for the wounded 
          colleague.</i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> Around 5pm they 
          announced on loudspeakers that those hiding in the Harmandir Sahib should

          heads."</i> </font>

          <i>"On the fifth night, the night of the real assault, mortars started 
          throwing up plaster. My wife and I and my two daughters decided to go 
          down from our flat on the first floor to the office, which is on the 
          ground floor. At this point I thought of surrendering but I was told 
          by a Bhindranwale man, 'One more step outside the complex and you are 
          a dead man'. Faced with this threat to my entire family plus the insecurity 
          of the office room, I decided to move down to a small basement where 
          there was a fridge. An exhaust fan outlet in the basement proved a life 
          saver. I could hear soldiers speaking outside and different instructions 
          from their commanders. Next to the basement was another cubicle facing 
          the Temple where a sewadar used to sleep. I heard the army drag out 
          this man. He was shot. Since extremists had been using all possible 
          openings as pill boxes and grenade launchers the soldiers decided to 
          lob grenades into all such openings, including my fan outlet. The minute 
          I heard the order we all moved under a staircase. Minutes later two 
          grenades came in. The splinters took three inches away from most of 
          the walls. But luckily we escaped. We spent the night under the staircase. 
          Eventually at about 11 am on the 6th my wife noticed an officer standing 
          outside. She called out to him to attract his attention and requested 
          him to rescue us. She told him that she had two young daughters. The 
          officer behaved decently and said, 'Don't worry I too have two daughters. 
          Nothing will happen to you. Stay put.' He organized chapattis, pickes 
          and drinking water. He eventually let us out when curfew lifted. </i></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> We had to step 
          over dead bodies strewn everywhere. We were taken to the square in front

          with the barrels pointing at me. I think they were about to shoot me 
          when a brigadier who recognized me intervened. We were then led by soldiers 
          across the parkarma to the library side. A lieutenant accompanied us. 
          Upon reaching the other side he asked me to stand against the wall and 
          lined up a firing squad. He asked me to say my prayers. I requested 
          to say good-bye to my wife and the two daughters. At this point the 
          brigadier showed up again and shouted at the young officer, 'What the

          "On the way back to the hotel (afternoon of June 6th) I witnessed a 
          scene at the Kotwali which is blood curdling. This is where some soldiers 
          were kicking some of the 11 suspected terrorists as they knelt on their 
          bare knees and crawled on the hot road surface."</i> </font>

          "The people were taken out of their houses. Men's hands were tied with 
          their turbans. Women's necks were sought to be asphyxiated with their 
          plaits. Then they were shot in the chests. No quarter was shown to women, 
          aged or children; in the eyes of the troops every Sikh was a terrorist. 
          Those who survived died of thirst. Their houses were ransacked, and 
          then put on fire. The area surrounding Darbar Sahib (Golden Temple) 
          was full of debris. What happened is beyond description of sight, hearing 
          or words."</i> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As night fell the 
          Army troops were given the order to storm the remains of the Akal Takht 
          and shoot on site anyone they found inside. The troops encounter little 
          resistance and find dead bodies and the smell of death everywhere. </font>

          In the early hours of the morning the troops discover the bodies of 
          Bhindranwale and his closest followers in the basement of the Akal Takht.

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The day was spent 
          in clean up operations flushing out any remaining snipers and collecting 
          the dead bodies. Soldiers were openly walking about the temple in their 
          shoes, drinking alcohol as well as smoking. Blood and bodies were strewn 
          all over the broken marble of the parkarma. With putrefying corpses 
          floating in the sacred pool of nectar and the smell of death everywhere.

          the entrance gate of the Golden Temple which houses many priceless treasures 
          was destroyed and looted. Although fighting had now died down, the central 
          library complex was mysteriously burned down. Many priceless manuscripts, 
          some in the Gurus own handwriting were lost forever. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The number of people 
          who lost their lives will never be known. The Army refused to let the 
          Red Cross enter the complex and cremated the dead before the bodies 
          could be identified or claimed by their families. The Amritsar municipal 
          sweepers refused to clear the dead bodies away but were eventually persuaded 
          by offers of rum and being allowed to strip the bodies of all valuables. 
          They piled the dead into garbage trucks and unceremoniously cremated 
          them. Family members were not allowed by the army to claim the remains 
          or perform any traditional funeral rites. It is clear that thousands 
          lost their lives in the Temple complex. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Elsewhere across 
          Punjab hundreds of Sikhs were killed in the army operation at the same 
          time which saw 42 Gurdwaras raided at the same time as the Golden Temple, 
          including high casualties at Moga, Mukatsar, Faridkot, Patiala, Ropar

          Kar Seva is the ceremonial cleaning of the sacred pool is normally undertaken 
          every 50 years. A special Kar Seva was undertaken in 1985 to replace 
          some of the damage. Tens of thousands of Sikhs participated and the 
          sacred pool of nectar was completely drained and cleaned. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Restoration work 
          has taken 15 years to complete.The Akal Takht has been entirely rebuilt. 
          The marble of the parkarma has been replaced in sections with new marble. 
          Repair work on Harmandir Sahib included reguilding the temple dome and 
          walls with new gold. The Ramgharia Bungas have been repaired and Teja 
          Singh Samundri Hall has been left, pockmarked with bullet holes as a 
          reminder of the tragedy. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> What was one of 
          the darkest chapters of Sikh history, reminiscent of the persecution 
          the Sikhs faced at the hands of the Mughals has acted like a lightening 
          rod for all Sikhs. It should not be viewed as a cause of incitement 
          of hatred, but rather as a jolting reminder to Sikhs that they cannot 
          take the existence of their religion for granted. As caretakers of the 
          Sikh religion, it is up to Sikhs to actively participate and make sure 
          that the message of the Gurus and the Sikh religion survives and grows, 
          overcoming any and all adversities </font>
