          way of life and philosophy well ahead of its time when it was founded 
          over 500 years ago, The Sikh religion today has a following of over 20 
          million people worldwide. Sikhism preaches a message of devotion and remembrance 
          of God at all times, truthful living, equality of mankind, social justice 
          and denounces superstitions and blind rituals. Sikhism is open to all 
          through the teachings of its 10 Gurus enshrined in the Sikh Holy Book 
          and Living Guru, Sri Guru Granth Sahib.</font><br>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Who and What is 
          a Sikh? </b></font> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The word 'Sikh' 
            in the Punjabi language means 'disciple', Sikhs are the disciples of 
            God who follow the writings and teachings of the Ten Sikh Gurus. The 
            wisdom of these teachings in Sri Guru Granth Sahib are practical and 
            universal in their appeal to all mankind.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;I observe 
              neither Hindu fasting nor the ritual of the Muslim Ramadan month; Him 
              I serve who at the last shall save. The Lord of universe of the Hindus, 
              Gosain and Allah to me are one; From Hindus and Muslims have I broken 
              free. I perform neither Kaaba pilgrimage nor at bathing spots worship; 
              One sole Lord I serve, and no other. I perform neither the Hindu worship 
              nor the Muslim prayer; To the Sole Formless Lord in my heart I bow. 
              We neither are Hindus nor Muslims; Our body and life belong to the One 
              Supreme Being who alone is both Ram and Allah for us.&quot;</i> (Guru 
              Arjan Dev, Guru Granth Sahib, Raga Bhairon pg. 1136)</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Any human 
                being who faithfully believes in: (i) One Immortal Being, (ii) Ten Gurus, 
                from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh, (iii) The Guru Granth Sahib, 
                (iv) The utterances and teachings of the ten Gurus and, (v) the baptism 
                bequeathed by the tenth Guru, and who does not owe allegiance to any

            <img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> There is only One God. He is the same God for 
                    all people of all religions.</font>

            The soul goes through cycles of births and deaths before it reaches 
            the human form. The goal of our life is to lead an exemplary existence 
            so that one may merge with God. Sikhs should remember God at all times 
            and practice living a virtuous and truthful life while maintaining a 
            balance between their spiritual obligations and temporal obligations.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> 
            The true path to achieving salvation and merging with God does not require 
            renunciation of the world or celibacy, but living the life of a householder, 
            earning a honest living and avoiding worldly temptations and sins.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> 
            Sikhism condemns blind rituals such as fasting, visiting places of pilgrimage, 
            superstitions, worship of the dead, idol worship etc.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images\bullet_k.gif"> 
            Sikhism preaches that people of different races, religions, or sex are 
            all equal in the eyes of God. It teaches the full equality of men and 
            women. Women can participate in any religious function or perform any 
            Sikh ceremony or lead the congregation in prayer.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>History and Practices</b></font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The founder of the 
                              Sikh religion was Guru Nanak who was born in 1469. He preached a message 
                              of love and understanding and criticized the blind rituals of the Hindus 
                              and Muslims. Guru Nanak passed on his enlightened leadership of this 
                              new religion to nine successive Gurus. The final living Guru, Guru Gobind 
                              Singh died in 1708. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During his lifetime 
                                Guru Gobind Singh established the Khalsa order (meaning 'The Pure'), 
                                soldier-saints. The Khalsa uphold the highest Sikh virtues of commitment, 
                                dedication and a social conscious. The Khalsa are men and women who 
                                have undergone the Sikh baptism ceremony and who strictly follow the 
                                Sikh Code of Conduct and Conventions and wear the prescribed physical 
                                articles of the faith. One of the more noticeable being the uncut hair 
                                (required to be covered with a turban for men) and the Kirpan (ceremonial 
                                sword). </font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before his death 
                                  in 1708 Guru Gobind Singh declared that the Sikhs no longer needed a 
                                  living and appointed his spiritual successor as Sri Guru Granth Sahib, 
                                  his physical successor as the Khalsa. Guru Gobind Singh felt that all 
                                  the wisdom needed by Sikhs for spiritual guidance in their daily lives 
                                  could be found in Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the Eternal Guru of the Sikhs. 
                                  Sri Guru Granth Sahib is unique in the world of religious scriptures 
                                  because not only is it accorded the status of being the spiritual head 
                                  of the Sikh religion, but besides the poetry of the Gurus, it also contains 
                                  the writings of saints of other faiths whose thoughts were consistent 
                                  with those of the Sikh Gurus.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sikhism does not 
                                    have priests, which were abolished by Guru Gobind Singh. The Guru felt 
                                    that they had become corrupt and full of ego. Sikhs only have custodians 
                                    of the Guru Granth Sahib (granthi), and any Sikh is free to read the 
                                    Guru Granth Sahib in the Gurdwara (a Sikh temple) or in their home. 
                                    All people of all religions are welcome to the Gurdwara. A free community 
                                    kitchen can be found at every Gurdwara which serves meals to all people 
                                    of all faiths. Guru Nanak first started this institution which outline 
                                    the basic Sikh principles of service, humility and equality. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most significant 
                                      historical religious center for the Sikhs is Harmiandir Sahib (The Golden 
                                      Temple) at Amritsar in the state of Punjab in northern India. It is 
                                      the inspirational and historical center of Sikhism but is not a mandatory 
                                      place of pilgrimage or worship. All places where Sri Guru Granth Sahib 
                                      are installed are considered equally holy for Sikhs.</font>
