        <i>Article XXIII</i></font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The concept of 
            service is not confined to fanning the congregation, service to and 
            in the common kitchen-cum-eating house, etc. A Sikh’s entire life is 
            a life of benevolent exertion. The most fruitful service is the service 
            that secures the optimum good by minimal endeavor. That can be achieved 
            through organized collective action. A Sikh has, for this reason, to 
            fulfill his Panthic obligations (obligations as a member of the corporate 
            entity, the Panth), even as he/she performs his/her individual duties. 
            This corporate entity is the Panth. Every Sikh has also to fulfill his 
            obligations as a unit of the corporate body, the Panth.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (a) The Guru Panth 
            (Panth’s status of Guruhood) means the whole body of committed baptized 
            Sikhs. This body was fostered by all the ten Gurus and the tenth Guru 
            gave it its final shape and invested it with Guruhood.</font> </p>

            where ambrosial baptism is to be administered, the holy Guru Granth 
            Sahib should be installed and ceremonially opened. Also present should 
            be six committed baptized Sikhs, one of whom should sit in attendance 
            of the Guru Granth Sahib and the other five should be there to administer 
            the ambrosial baptism. These six may even include Sikh women. All of 
            them must have taken bath and washed their hair.</font> </p>

            with a broken or disabled limb, or one suffering from some chronic disease. 
            The number should not include anyone who has committed a breach of the 
            Sikh discipline and principles. All of them should be committed baptized 
            Sikhs with appealing personalities.</font> </p>

            baptized should not be of very young age; he or she should have attained 
            a plausible degree of discretion. The person to be baptized must have 
            taken bath and washed the hair and must wear all five K’s - Kesh (unshorn 
            hair), strapped Kirpan (sword), Kachhehra (prescribed shorts), Kanga

            the presence of the congregation.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (f) One from amongst 
            the five beloved ones administering ambrosial baptism to persons seeking 
            to be baptized should explain the principles of the Sikh religion to 
            them:</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Sikh religion 
            advocated the renunciation of the worship of any created thing, and 
            rendering of worship and loving devotion to, and meditating on, the 
            One Supreme Creator. For the fulfillment of such devotion and meditation, 
            reflection on the contents of Gurbani and practicing of its tenets, 
            participation in the congregational services, rendering service to the 
            Panth, benevolent exertion (to promote the good of others), love of 
            God’s name (loving reflection on the experience of the Divine), living 
            within the Sikh discipline after getting baptized etc. are the principal 
            means.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He should conclude 
            his exposition of the principles of Sikh religion with the query: Do 
            you accept these willingly?</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (g) On an affirmative 
            response from the seekers of baptism, one from amongst the five beloved 
            ones should perform the Ardas for the preparation of baptism and take 
            the holy Hukam (command). The five beloved ones should come close to 
            the bowl for preparing the amrit (ambrosial nectar).</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (h) The bowl should 
            be of pure steel and it should be placed on a clean steel ring or other 
            clean support.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (i) Clean water 
            and sugar puffs should be put in the bowl and the five beloved ones 
            should sit around it in bir posture [Sitting in bir posture comprises 
            sitting resting the body on the right leg, the right calf and foot gathered 
            inward and the left leg upto the shin kept in a vertical position.] 
            and recite the undermentioned scriptural compositions.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (j) The scriptural 
            composition to be recited are: The Japuji, the Jaap, The Ten Sawayyas 
            (commencing with sarawag sud), The Bainti Chaupai (from “hamri karo 
            hath dai rachha” to “susht dokh te leho bachai”), the first five and 
            the last one stanza of the Anand Sahib.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (k) Each of the 
            five beloved ones who recites the scripture should hold the edge of 
            the bowl with his left hand and keep stirring the water with a double-edged 
            sword held in his right hand. He should do that with full concentration. 
            The rest of the beloved ones should keep gripping the edge of the bowl 
            with both hands concentrating their full attention on the ambrosial 
            nectar.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (l) After the conclusion 
            of the recitation, one from amongst the beloved ones should perform 
            the Ardas.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (m) Only that person 
            seeking to be baptized who has participated in the entire ceremony of 
            ambrosial baptism can be baptized. One who has turned up while the ceremony 
            was in progress cannot be baptized.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (n) After the Ardas 
            as per clause (1) above, thinking of our Father, the tenth Master, the 
            wearer of the aigrette, every person seeking to be baptized should sit 
            in bir posture, putting his/her right hand cupped on the left cupped 
            hand and be made to drink the ambrosial mix five times, as the beloved 
            one who pours the mix into his cupped hand exclaims: say, Waheguru ji 
            ka Khalsa, Waheguru ji ki Fateh! (The Khalsa is of the Wondrous Destroyer 
            of darkness; victory too, is His!) The person being baptized should 
            after imbibling the ambrosia, repeat: Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru 
            ji ki Fateh. Then five handfuls of the ambrosial mix should be sprinkled 
            into the eyes of the person being baptized and another five into his 
            hair. Each such sprinkling should be accompanied by the beloved one 
            administering baptism saying, “Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru ji ki 
            Fateh”, and the person being baptized repeating the chant. Whatever 
            ambrosial mix is left over after the administration of the ambrosial 
            baptism to all individual seekers, should be sipped by all (men and 
            women) baptized, together.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (o) After this 
            the five beloved ones, all together in chorus, communicating the name 
            of Waheguru to all who have been administered the ambrosial baptism, 
            recite to them the mul mantar (basic creed, seminal chant) and make 
            them repeat it aloud: ik aunkar satnam karta purakh nirbhau nirwair 
            akal murat ajuni saibhang gur prasad.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (p) After this, 
            one from amongst the five beloved ones should explain to the initiates 
            the discipline of the order: Today you are reborn in the true Guru’s 
            household, ending the cycle of migration, and joined the Khalsa Panth 
            (order). Your spiritual father is now Guru Gobind Singh and, spiritual 
            mother, Mata Sahib Kaur. Your place of birth is Kesgarh Sahib and your 
            native place is Anandpur Sahib. You, being the sons of one father, are, 
            inter-se yourselves and other baptized Sikhs, spiritual brothers. You 
            have become the pure Khalsa, having renounced your previous lineage, 
            professional background, calling (occupation), beliefs, that is, having 
            given up all connections with your caste, descent, birth, country, religion, 
            etc.. You are to worship none except the One Timeless Being - no god, 
            goddess, incarnation or prophet. You are not to think of anyone except 
            the ten Gurus and anything except their gospel as your savior. You are 
            supposed to know Gurmukhi (Punjabi alphabet). (If you do not, you must 
            learn it). And recite, or listen in to the recitation of, the undermentioned 
            scriptural compositions, the daily repetition of which is ordained, 
            every day: (1) The Japuji Sahib, (2) The Jaap Sahib, (3) The Ten Sawayyas 
            (Quartrains), beginning “sarawag sudh”, (4) The Sodar Rahiras and the 
            Sohila. Besides, you should read from or listen in to the recitation 
            from the Guru Granth. Have, on your person, all the time, the five K’s: 
            The Keshas (unshorn hair), the Kirpan (sheathed sword) [The length of 
            the sword to be worn is not prescribed.], the Kachhehra [The Kachhehra 
            (drawers like garment) may be made from any cloth, but its legs should 
            not reach down to below the shins.], the Kanga (comb), the Karha (steel
