          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fight against social and political injustice has historically been 
          an integral part of Sikhism. As a religious leader Guru Nanak did not 
          turn a blind eye to political supression or consider it outside the 
          realm of religion, but undertook political protest 
          through his writings, speaking out against the cruelty of rulers. Guru 
          Nanak wrote a number of passages about the Mughal invasion of India 
          by Babur and the brutalities that he eyewitnessed first hand (Babur 
          Bani). Guru Nanak also spoke out about the suffering of people at the 
          hands of unscrupulous rulers and government officials </font></p>

Having attacked Khuraasaan, Babar terrified Hindustan. The Creator Himself 
          does not take the blame, but has sent the Mugal as the messenger of 
          death. There was so much slaughter that the people screamed. Didn't 
          You feel compassion, Lord? || 1 || O Creator Lord, You are the Master 
          of all. If some powerful man strikes out against another man, then no 
          one feels any grief in their mind. || 1 || Pause || But if a powerful 
          tiger attacks a flock of sheep and kills them, then its master must 
          answer for it. This priceless country has been laid waste and defiled 
          by dogs, and no one pays any attention to the dead. You Yourself unite, 
          and You Yourself separate; I gaze upon Your Glorious Greatness. || 2 
          || One may give himself a great name, and revel in the pleasures of 
          the mind, but in the Eyes of the Lord and Master, he is just a worm, 
          for all the corn that he eats. Only one who dies to his ego while yet 
          alive, obtains the blessings, O Nanak, by chanting the Lord's Name. </font>

            Those heads adorned with braided hair, with their parts painted with 
            vermillion - those heads were shaved with scissors, and their throats 
            were choked with dust. They lived in palatial mansions, but now, they 
            cannot even sit near the palaces. || 1 || Hail to You, O Father Lord, 
            Hail to You! O Primal Lord. Your limits are not known; You create, and 
            create, and behold the scenes. || 1 || Pause || When they were married, 
            their husbands looked so handsome beside them. They came in palanquins, 
            decorated with ivory; water was sprinkled over their heads, and glittering 
            fans were waved above them. || 2 || They were given hundreds of thousands 
            of coins when they sat, and hundreds of thousands of coins when they 
            stood. They ate coconuts and dates, and rested comfortably upon their 
            beds. But ropes were put around their necks, and their strings of pearls 
            were broken. || 3 || Their wealth and youthful beauty, which gave them 
            so much pleasure, have now become their enemies. The order was given 
            to the soldiers, who dishonored them, and carried them away. If it is 
            pleasing to God's Will, He bestows greatness; if is pleases His Will, 
            He bestows punishment. || 4 || If someone focuses on the Lord beforehand, 
            then why should he be punished? The kings had lost their higher consciousness, 
            reveling in pleasure and sensuality. Since Babar's rule has been proclaimed, 
            even the princes have no food to eat. || 5 || The Muslims have lost 
            their five times of daily prayer, and the Hindus have lost their worship 
            as well. Without their sacred squares, how shall the Hindu women bathe 
            and apply the frontal marks to their foreheads? They never remembered 
            their Lord as Raam, and now they cannot even chant Khudaa-i || 6 || 
            Some have returned to their homes, and meeting their relatives, they 
            ask about their safety. For some, it is pre-ordained that they shall 
            sit and cry out in pain. Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass. O Nanak, 
            what is the fate of mankind? || 7 || 11 || AASAA, FIRST MEHL: Where 
            are the games, the stables, the horses? Where are the drums and the 
            bugles? Where are the sword-belts and chariots? Where are those scarlet 
            uniforms? Where are the rings and the beautiful faces? They are no longer 
            to be seen here. || 1 || This world is Yours; You are the Lord of the 
            Universe. In an instant, You establish and disestablish. You distribute 
            wealth as it pleases You. || 1 || Pause || Where are the houses, the 
            gates, the hotels and palaces? Where are those beautiful way-stations? 
            Where are those beautiful women, reclining on their beds, whose beauty 
            would not allow one to sleep?Where are those betel leaves, their sellers, 
            and the haremees? They have vanished like shadows. || 2 || For the sake 
            of this wealth, so many were ruined; because of this wealth, so many 
            have been disgraced. It was not gathered without sin, and it does not 
            go along with the dead. Those, whom the Creator Lord would destroy - 
            first He strips them of virtue. || 3 || Millions of religious leaders 
            failed to halt the invader, when they heard of the Emperor's invasion. 
            He burned the rest-houses and the ancient temples; he cut the princes 
            limb from limb, and cast them into the dust. None of the Mugals went 
            blind, and no one performed any miracle. || 4 || The battle raged between 
            the Mugals and the Pat'haans, and the swords clashed on the battlefield. 
            They took aim and fired their guns, and they attacked with their elephants. 
            Those men whose letters were torn in the Lord's Court, were destined 
            to die, O Siblings of Destiny. || 5 || The Hindu women, the Muslim women, 
            the Bhattis and the Rajputs - some had their robes torn away, from head 
            to foot, while others came to dwell in the cremation ground. Their husbands 
            did not return home - how did they pass their night? || 6 || The Creator 
            Himself acts, and causes others to act. Unto whom should we complain? 
            Pleasure and pain come by Your Will; unto whom should we go and cry? 
            The Commander issues His Command, and is pleased. O Nanak, we receive 
            what is written in our destiny. </font> </p>

            As the Word of the Forgiving Lord comes to me, so do I express it, O 
            Lalo. Bringing the marriage party of sin, Babar has invaded from Kaabul, 
            demanding our land as his wedding gift, O Lalo. Modesty and righteousness 
            both have vanished, and falsehood struts around like a leader, O Lalo. 
            The Qazis and the Brahmins have lost their roles, and Satan now conducts 
            the marriage rites, O Lalo. The Muslim women read the Koran, and in 
            their misery, they call upon God, O Lalo. The Hindu women of high social 
            status, and others of lowly status as well, are put into the same category, 
            O Lalo. The wedding songs of murder are sung, O Nanak, and blood is 
            sprinkled instead of saffron, O Lalo. || 1 || Nanak sings the Glorious 
            Praises of the Lord and Master in the city of corpses, and voices this 
            account. The One who created, and attached the mortals to pleasures, 
            sits alone, and watches this. The Lord and Master is True, and True 
            is His justice. He issues His Commands according to His judgement. The 
            body-fabric will be torn apart into shreds, and then India will remember 
            these words. Coming in seventy-eight (1521 A.D.), they will depart in 
            ninety-seven (1540 A.D.), and then another disciple of man will rise 
            up. Nanak speaks the Word of Truth; he proclaims the Truth at this, 
            the right time.</font> </p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>(Rag Malar, 
            pg.1288)</b></i><br>
            Deer, falcons and government officials are known to be trained and clever. 
            When the trap is set, they trap their own kind; hereafter they will 
            find no place of rest. He alone is learned and wise, and he alone is 
            a scholar, who practices the Name. First, the tree puts down its roots, 
            and then it spreads out its shade above. The kings are tigers, and their 
            officials are dogs; they go out and awaken the sleeping people to harass 
            them. The public servants inflict wounds with their nails. The dogs 
            lick up the blood that is spilled. But there, in the Court of the Lord, 
            all beings will be judged. Those who have violated the people's trust 
            will be disgraced; their noses will be cut off. </font> </p>
