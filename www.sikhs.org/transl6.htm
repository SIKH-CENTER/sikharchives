          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bedtime prayer, Kirtan Sohila is usually 
          recited just before sleeping at night. It's name means 'Song of Peace'. 
          Kirtan Sohila is composed of five hymns, the first three by Guru Nanak 
          Dev, the fourth by Guru Ram Das and the fifth by Guru Arjan Dev. This 
          hymn is usually recited at the conclusion of evening ceremonies at the 
          Gurdwara and also recited as part of Sikh funeral services.</font></p>

            are thousands, yet You have no feet; You are without nose, yet You have 
            a thousand noses; Your plays have, in this way, bewitched me.</font> </p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When they walk 
            forward, that thorn pricks them more and more severly; they suffer greater 
            pain and finally receive on their heads, the blows from deaths staff.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> True devotees are 
            absorbed in Gods Name, and fear of the pain of birth and deaths leaves
