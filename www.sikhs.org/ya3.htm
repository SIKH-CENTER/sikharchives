          <h3>The Anti Sikh</h3>
          
        
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will start with 
          the question, how not to be a &quot;Bad Sikh,&quot; if there is such 
          a person. So we begin with discussion of some sinister elements inside 
          the Sikh arena: </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This end of the 
          spectrum is discussed simply for the sake of completeness. This does 
          not pertain to people outside the Sikh faith. Anti Sikhs are those inside 
          the Sikh society who appear to be Sikhs due to birth, appearance, or 
          their claims in their writings, but they disrupt the faith through intentional 
          acts. They show respect for the Sikh faith, along with their effort 
          to confuse others with remarks and suggestions against the Panth. They 
          will use obsolete and strange terms deliberately to create confusion 
          and division among the Sikhs. For example: Anti Sikhs will try to rekindle 
          the issue of cast and class in Sikh society to achieve their aims, because 
          it still works on most South Asians. In reality, this issue has been 
          long removed from the Sikh Panth, since the time of Guru Nanak, more 
          than five hundred years ago.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will also find 
          them disrupting the places of prayer by causing fights in the Gurudwaras. 
          They are eager to get elected to an office in Sikh organizations. Often, 
          they try to control the Sikh places of worship, especially after a significant 
          amount of money from worship offerings has been accumulated. Anti Sikhs 
          need to be distinguished from those devout Sikhs who appear to be engaged 
          in a similar activity while trying to defend a just cause, whose only 
          interest is selfless service. Obviously, those who raise questions because 
          of their ignorance should not be called Anti Sikh.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the eyes of The 
          Tenth Master, Guru Gobind Singh, sects, cults, saints and gurus with 
          a Sikh appearance and name, who specifically lead the Sikhs away from 
          the Sikh Panth, can be called Anti Panth. They undermine the Khalsa 
          Panth, as it was outlined by The Tenth Master, without thinking. God 
          has created a variety of people, for a reason. All have an important 
          place in the divine plan. We should not argue with anyone. It is not 
          for us to dissect the spirituality of others. Some of these people are 
          very sincere and they appear to believe in what they do. However, some 
          of this can be because of a religiously exalted Ego, because, to a Gursikh, 
          their lack of esteem for the Panth is a clear evidence of some deficiency 
          in their spiritual experience. It is very important to understand the 
          following, a very common problem:</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just a miniscule 
          mystical feeling, a religious emotion or fervor, can make us feel divine, 
          and strangely, make us feel that we are &quot;Almost there.&quot; Whenever 
          this results in thinking that we are better than others are, or, if 
          it leads us away from a genuine Path, there is definitely a flaw somewhere. 
          Generally, the origin of such an exalting feeling is not to be blamed. 
          Our fanatic interpretation of - an extremely limited spiritual experience 
          - corrupts it. This is much more prevalent in the followers of imperfect 
          gurus. The result is a stronger ego, and argument with others, to the 
          extent that some feel justified and religious even if they kill those 
          who disagree, 'In God's name!' (Torturing a nonbeliever, and inventing 
          new devices to do it more thoroughly, has been the specialty of one 
          such &quot;religious&quot; group!)</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some Anti Sikhs 
          will stimulate doubts, and question authenticity of the established 
          Sikh literature, under the notion of Sikh renewal and research. This 
          is an issue of a separate paper. Anti Sikhs are modern counterparts 
          of Meenha, Massand, and Ram Rai, etc. The correct Sikh response is to 
          ignore them and avoid their company. The word &quot;hate&quot; is not 
          found in Gurbani, neither should it be found in a Sikh's heart. To a 
          Sikh, God has no enemy. The history of the Ten Masters also shows that 
          a true Sikh does not instigate violence. He does not engage in a physical 
          confrontation unless all peaceful means have failed. However, a Sikh 
          cannot be a bystander to someone slander his Guru, persecute people 
          because of their religion, or tyrannize the defenseless or the poor.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sikh way to 
          fight the darkness of ignorance is to first flood it with the light 
          of abundant goodness, as written by the Fourth Master, Guru Ram Das: 
          &quot;God's servant worships Ram Nam (generates goodness). When someone 
          talks evil of him (ignites wickedness), he does not lose his serenity 
          and simply continues in his virtue. He knows that God is in everything 
          and everyone. God created everything. (He created the wicked also, for 
          some reason). God gives people wisdom and, He Himself makes people do 
          what they do. When it pleases God, He lets them find the True Guru. 
          This resolves all their quibbling.&quot; (SGGS, p.720)</font>
