        <i>Article V</i></font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (a) One is more 
            easily and deeply affected by gurbani (the holy bani bequeathed by the 
            Gurus) participating in congregational gatherings. For this reason, 
            it is necessary for a Sikh that he visit the places where the Sikhs 
            congregate for worship and prayer (the gurduwaras), and joining the 
            congregation, partake of the benefits that the study of the holy scriptures 
            bestows.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (b) The Guru Granth 
            should be ceremonially opened in the gurduwara every day without fail. 
            Except for special exigencies, when there is need to keep the Guru Granth 
            open during the night, the Holy Book should not be kept open during 
            the night. It should, generally, be closed ceremonially after the conclusion 
            of the Rehras (evening scriptural recitation). The Holy Book should 
            remain open so long as a granthi or attendant can remain in attendance, 
            persons seeking darshan (seeking a view of or making obeisance to it) 
            keep coming, or there is no risk of commission of irreverence towards 
            it. Thereafter, it is advisable to close it ceremonially to avoid any 
            disrespect to it.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (c) The Guru Granth 
            should be opened, read and closed ceremonially with reverence. The place 
            where it is installed should be absolutely clean. An awning should be 
            erected above. The Guru Granth Sahib should be placed on a cot measuring 
            up to its size and overlaid with absolutely clean mattress and sheets. 
            For proper installation and opening of the Guru Granth, there should 
            be cushions/pillows of appropriate kind etc. and, for covering it, romalas 
            (sheet covers of appropriate size). When the Guru Granth is not being 
            read, it should remain covered with a romal. A whisk, too, should be 
            there.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (d) Anything except 
            the afore-mentioned reverential ceremonies, for instance, such practices 
            as the arti with burning incense and lamps, offering of eatables to 
            Guru Granth Sahib, burning of lights, beating of gongs, etc., is contrary 
            to gurmat (the Guru’s way). However, for the perfuming of the place, 
            the use of flowers, incense and scent is not barred. For light inside 
            the room, oil or butter-oil lamps, candles, electric lamps, kerosene 
            oil lamps, etc. may be lighted.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (e) No book should 
            be installed like and at par with the Guru Granth. Worship of any idol 
            or any ritual or activity should not be allowed to be conducted inside 
            the gurdwara. Nor should the festival of any other faith be allowed 
            to be celebrated inside the gurduwara. However, it will not be improper 
            to use any occasion or gathering for the propagation of the gurmat (The 
            Guru’s way).</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (f) Pressing the 
            legs of the cot on which the Guru Granth Sahib is installed, rubbing 
            nose against walls and on platforms, held sacred, or massaging these, 
            placing water below the Guru Granth Sahib’s seat, making or installing 
            statues, or idols inside the gurduwaras, bowing before the picture of 
            the Sikh Gurus or elders - all these are irreligious self-willed egotism, 
            contrary to gurmat (the Guru’s way).</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (g) When the Guru 
            Granth has to be taken from one place to another, the Ardas should be 
            performed. He/she who carries the Guru Granth on his/her head should 
            walk barefoot; but when the wearing of shoes is a necessity, no superstitions 
            need be entertained.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (h) The Guru Granth 
            Sahib should be ceremonially opened after performing the Ardas. After 
            the ceremonial opening, a hymn should be read from the Guru Granth Sahib.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (i) Whenever the 
            Guru Granth is brought, irrespective of whether or not another copy 
            of the Guru Granth has already been installed at the concerned place, 
            every Sikh should stand up to show respect.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (j) While going 
            into the gurduwara, one should take off the shoes and clean oneself 
            up. If the feet are dirty or soiled, they should be washed with water.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (k) No person, 
            no matter which country, religion or cast he/she belongs to, is debarred 
            from entering the gurduwara for darshan (seeing the holy shrine). However, 
            he/she should not have on his/her person anything, such as tobacco or 
            other intoxicants, which are tabooed by the Sikh religion.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (l) The first thing 
            a Sikh should do on entering the gurduwara is to do obeisance before 
            the Guru Granth Sahib. He/she should, thereafter, having a glimpse of 
            the congregation and bid in a low, quiet voice, “Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, 
            Waheguru ji ki Fateh”.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (m) In the congregation, 
            there should be no differentiation or discrimination between Sikh and 
            non-Sikh, persons traditionally regarded as touchable and untouchable, 
            the so called high and low caste persons, the high and the low.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (n) Sitting on 
            a cushion, a distinctive seat, a chair, a stool, a cot, etc. or in any 
            distinctive position in the presence of the Guru Granth or within the 
            congregation is contrary to gurmat (Guru’s way).</font> </p>

            sit bare-headed in the presence of the Guru Granth Sahib or in the congregation. 
            For Sikh women, joining the congregation with their persons uncomfortable 
            draped and with veils drawn over their faces is contrary to gurmat (Guru’s 
            way).</font> </p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (a) Only the sacred 
            pudding which has been prepared or got prepared according to the prescribed 
            method shall be acceptable in the congregation.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (b) The method 
            of preparing the Karhah Prashad is this: In a clean vessel, the three 
            contents (wheat flour, pure sugar and clarified butter, in equal quantities) 
            should be put and it should be made reciting the Scriptures. Then covered 
            with a clean piece of cloth, it should be placed on a clean stool in 
            front of the Guru Granth Sahib, the first five and the last stanza of 
            the Anand Sahib should be recited aloud (so that the congregation can 
            hear) [If another vessel of the sacred pudding is brought in after the 
            recitation of the Anand, it is not necessary to repeat the recitation 
            of the Anand Sahib. Offering of the pudding brought later to the sacred 
            Kirpan is enough.], the Ardas, offered and the pudding tucked with the 
            sacred Kirpan for acceptance.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (c) After this, 
            before the distribution to the congregation of the Karhah Prashad, the 
            share of the five beloved ones should be set apart and given away. Thereafter, 
            while commencing the general distribution, the share of the person in 
            attendance of the Guru Granth Sahib should be put in a small bowl or 
            vessel and handed over [Giving double share to the person in attendance 
            constitutes improper discrimination]. The person who doles out the Karhah 
            Prashad among the congregation should do so without any discrimination 
            on the basis of personal regard or spite. He should dole out the Karhah 
            Prashad equally to the Sikhs, the non-Sikhs or a person of high or low 
            caste. While doling out the Karhah Prashad, no discrimination should 
            be made on considerations of caste or ancestry or being regarded, by 
            some, as untouchable, of persons within the congregation.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (d) The offering 
            of Karhaha Prashad should be accompanied by at least two pice in cash.</font> </p>
