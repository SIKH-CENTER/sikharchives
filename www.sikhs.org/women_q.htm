          of woman, we are conceived in the womb of woman, we are engaged and 
          married to woman. We make friendship with woman and the lineage continued 
          because of woman. When one woman dies, we take another one, we are bound 
          with the world through woman. Why should we talk ill of her, who gives 
          birth to kings? The woman is born from woman; there is none without 
          her. Only the One True Lord is without woman" (Guru Nanak, Var Asa,
