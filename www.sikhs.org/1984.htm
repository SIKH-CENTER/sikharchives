      <td> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In early June 1984 
        the Indian Army invaded the most sacred of all Sikh shrines, the Golden 
        Temple complex to flush out Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale a Sikh leader 
        and his militant followers who had made the temple their refuge. The destruction 
        and loss of life marked the darkest chapter in Sikh history this century. 
        This event marked a critical turning point for all Sikhs around the world 
        as it made them realize that they could not take the existence of their 
        religion for granted. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> What is tragic 
          is that a tense situation which could have been resolved without a shot 
          being fired was allowed to deteriorate to the point where the sacred 
          sanctity of the Golden Temple complex was violated and desecrated in 
          the most brutal and unholy way. Thousands of innocent visiting pilgrims 
          and temple workers lost their lives in a sacred place of worship.The 
          Akal Takht, the seat of supreme Sikh temporal power was reduced to rubble. 
          Harmandir Sahib was riddled with over 300 bullets. The Sikh library 
          with precious manuscripts of the Gurus was burned to the ground. The 
          Temple treasury Toshakhana with priceless historical artifacts of Maharaja 
          Ranjit Singh was destroyed. The continuos reading of Sri Guru Granth 
          Sahib in Harmandir Sahib was interrupted for the first time in hundreds 
          of years. These events have forever left a permanent scar on the Sikh 
          psyche.</font>
